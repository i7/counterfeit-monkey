Good, you're conscious. We're conscious. I've heard urban legends about synthesis going wrong, one half person getting lost.

Exactly right. And I'm Alex, making us jointly Alexandra. As far as I can tell, the operation was a success. We're meant to be one person now, unrecognizable to anyone who knew us before.

>wave l-remover at plans
We smoothly, and almost without thinking about it, reset your device to be an L-remover. There is a smell of anise, and the plans turn into some pans. A set of flat skillets in cast iron: extremely bulky and heavy.

We can't reasonably carry the whole stack of pans, so they fall to the ground with a dramatic crash.

Mine: a little bit worn, but capacious. It doesn't have any identifying marks on it, and I thought a brand-new bag would look more suspicious. It's closed.

In the backpack are your L-remover, a cate, a lime, a wig, a flash drive, and a monocle.

I figured that it would be undisturbed there for a couple of hours, in the dark and out of sight, and if anyone found it they would probably turn it in to Lost and Found. But it is a big relief to find it still there.

Back Alley
This isn't much, is it? Just the back sides of a couple of buildings, some peeling yellow paint, and not even much by way of windows to look in through. I think the place where we had the procedure done is just a block or two away, but I've already lost the door. I imagine they change it.

This alley runs north to the open street, towards the town square. That's the way we'll want to go first.

/We can see a backpack here. (There|In the backpack) are your L-remover, a cate, a lime, and a flash drive( in the backpack)?.

We can also see some dusty tomes, a bent twig, a broken clock, some members, an army, and some pans here.

Back Alley
There is nothing here but the back sides of a couple of buildings, some peeling yellow paint; not even much by way of windows to look in through.

This alley runs north to the open street, towards the town square.

/We can see a backpack here. (There|In the backpack) are your L-remover, a cate, a lime, and a flash drive( in the backpack)?.

>x bent twig
Nine or ten inches long, very thin and somewhat flexible. There are no leaves left on it.

The monocle pings happily as we sight the bent twig with the crosshairs.

/(Something makes you think|You are reminded) of how we got here.

[MEMORIES will list your currently active memories]
>x broken clock
It appears to be one of those archetypal alarm clocks that crows at sunrise and generally makes a nuisance of itself. It shows the time to be about ten past nine.

It's stopped working sometime in the recent past, possibly thanks to its fall when we gelled it.

>wave t-remover at twig
We run our thumb over the dial, setting the device to a T-remover. With a distinct whiff of the faintest whiff of dust, the bent twig turns into a Ben wig. It is a wig belonging to — at a guess — a Ben Franklin costume. A rubbery pate simulates baldness at the top of the head, while grey curls hang below. It would not, I fear, look remotely persuasive on our head.

There is a dismissive blatt from the monocle, and transposed over the Ben wig is a faint, greenish image of a bent twig.

>wave l-remover at clock
We reset the device to l. The device buzzes, puzzled. It has tried to create a "broken cock": evidently "clock" is too tightly bound to its modifiers and can't be manipulated separately. This is a serious problem in my field of study, incidentally.

>wave m-remover at tomes
We reset the device to m. The device buzzes, puzzled. It has tried to create a "dusty toes": evidently "tomes" are too tightly bound to their modifiers and can't be manipulated separately. Or perhaps it just doesn't have sufficient power to handle the dusty tomes.

>wave s-remover at members
We reset the device to s. There is a distinct spearmint flavor, and the members turn into a member. It is a figure of a member of the Committee to Establish an Orthodox Orthography. It is plastic, small enough to sit on our palm, and wears the stiff clothing and conservative hairstyle of about 1895. It looks slightly cross, as though the member has guessed its work would take another 15 years to complete.

There is a dismissive blatt from the monocle, and transposed over the member is a faint, greenish image of some members.

You have a fleeting thought of how we got here.

[MEMORIES will list your currently active memories]
>wave y-remover at army
We reset the device to y. We wave the Y-remover at the army and produce an arm, severed (because after all it would be beyond the parameters of the change to generate the person whose body part it is). It is only moderately gory, and most locals get used to seeing this kind of thing as a prank from six-year-olds every halloween. Still, it might startle a tourist.

>gonear drinks club
Fleur d'Or Drinks Club
The back wall is dramatically decorated with bottled liquors of all sorts, from gin to cachaça; there's a giant bottle of Campari, taller than your average three-year-old, with a red ribbon around its neck.

What makes this place technically a drinks club rather than a bar is its license to serve letter-manufactured food and drink. A toolkit on the bar contains some gimlets and some rusty nails, ready to be transformed into their respective cocktails.

The bartender is in the middle of showing her homonym paddle to a patron holding a gin and tonic. The other patrons are scattered around the room at small tables, drinking or talking among themselves.

She acknowledges us with a nod as we stroll up to the bar and get close enough to hear their conversation. "It was originally produced as a toy, but it's actually a bit dangerous," the bartender is saying.

"Dangerous? How so?" asks the patron.

"Various ways," she says. "Suppose I hit a small object that has a big homonym, like say a plane. You know, the carpentry kind. Suddenly I've got an airplane-style plane on top of me."

>autoupgrade
"What if you hit something that doesn't mean anything else?" the patron asks. "Like a chicken?"

"Nothing," she says. "That's safe." As though to demonstrate, she smacks the paddle against her left buttock. "See? I don't get changed into a different bartender. Want to try?"

She holds up the paddle as though she's going to tap him with it.

"Uh... my name is Mark," he says.

"Maybe not, then!" she says, laughing brightly.

#hard2

>wave p-remover at patron
We reset the device to p. The letter-remover finds no p in Mark.

"That was a little dangerous, wasn't it?" Mark asks. "If you had tapped me with that thing, wouldn't I be a giant X on the carpet now?"

"Not for long," the bartender says. "I do have some restoration gel for emergencies. Or I could just hit you again with the paddle. But there would be an incident report and I could lose my license. So, yeah, better not."

>wave m-remover at patron
We reset the device to m. With a distinct whiff of newly sawn planks, Mark turns into an ark. From here, the width of the bow in cubits is hard to guess. It just looks huge, much too huge for the little space it's crammed into…

Unfortunately, the ark is more than sufficient to bury us under its bulk.

That is, that's what would have happened if we had done something so foolish. Shall we suppose we didn't? >>

>g

>ask about paddle
"Tell me about that paddle," we say.

"This item," says the bartender, flourishing it for you to see, "is a genuine licensed homonym paddle. Changes one item into another item as long as the two have identical names."

>say hello to mark
We already have the attention of the bartender, not to mention the curiosity of Mark.

>ask mark about mark

/The bartender (doesn't seem interested in talking|doesn't have anything to say) about Mark at the moment.

>ask mark about the paddle
We give Mark a look to say his input would be welcome as well.

"Tell me about that paddle," we say.

The bartender explains again the concept of a homonym paddle that is able to convert an item into another item of the same name.

>gonear parker
Counterfeit Monkey
It takes a minute for us to adjust to the light in here. Built when people were a bit shorter and ceilings were a bit lower, the Counterfeit Monkey is always smoky and never well lit, even in the middle of the day.

"Help you?" asks Parker the barman unenthusiastically.

/((I'm inclined|We want|I'd like) to|We could) ask whether he has seen Slango.

#clientele-bug

>ask parker about slango
"I wonder whether you've seen an associate of mine," we say to Parker. "Name of Slango."

Parker looks over the bar at us. "He comes in here from time to time," he says. "Very regular customer. Always has about three rum and cokes."

This is a lie, and therefore a test. Slango doesn't drink alcohol himself and doesn't permit drunkenness in his crew.

/We (want to|could) challenge Parker about the rum.

>ask men about slango
They're... busy. At best interrupting them would interrupt their code, and at worst it would make them think we are a Bureau agent.

/(We (want to|could)|I'd like to) challenge Parker about the rum.

>gonear arbot
(Arbot Maps & Antiques)
Arbot Maps & Antiques
There is a large collection of vintage and antique maps under glass — the island of Atlantis as a whole, street maps of here and of Maiana, navigation maps of the harbor, and then maps of more distant places as well.

A stylish mannequin near the front sports a pair of Britishizing goggles.

Overseeing all this is a woman named Kate.

"Welcome to Arbot," says Kate. "Feel free to browse and ask me any questions you may have about the merchandise."

#car-behavior

>car-acquire
High Street
Hustle, bustle, dirt; ugly American chain shops; lots and lots of people.

The curb is lined with garbage.

Our car — a sub-sub-compact that looks like it might be outraced by a kid on a scooter — is parked nearby. Here is how my mother gets around. She takes a 300 Euro Hermès scarf with an orange border and a pattern of prancing horses. She tosses it in the air. As it falls, she shoots it twice, like a clay pigeon: once to take out the F, the second time for the S. And such a car: buttery leather seats, jaguar lines. If someone asks how she gets such good results, she jokes that it's because of her quality materials.

Suffice it to say that we are not similarly blessed.

To the west, the street turns into a monumental staircase leading to the old fortified area — your hostel should be up that way — while a cross street heads southeast towards the main roundabout.

>unprotest
>put remover in backpack
We put the P-remover into the backpack.

>close backpack
We close the backpack.

>cross traffic
You may have the nerve, but I don't.

>ignore traffic
You may have the nerve, but I don't.

>drive to roundabout
We open the car door: perhaps unsurprisingly, it comes without an effective lock system.

We get into the car.

We switch on the ignition and the car comes to life. Smelly, trembling, putt-putting life, but still, not bad for something we conjured out of a vegetable picked outside my parents' place.

Roundabout (jammed into the car)
We are jammed into the car with our knees almost at our chin, looking out through the bulbous little windshield. The motor is growling like a housecat with pneumonia.

The traffic flows in a tight circle around a statue which we can never see clearly.

Confusing signs point in various directions: northeast to Deep Street, northwest to High Street, south to Long Street, east to Tall Street.

The car is making an unpleasant raspy growl.

/(Please don't try to change lanes|They're honking at us for a reason, you know).

>park

>go to deep street

Deep Street (jammed into the car)
We are jammed into the car with our knees almost at our chin, looking out through the bulbous little windshield. The motor is growling like a housecat with pneumonia.

This road descends steeply from southwest to northwest, passing between white concrete buildings to provide access to the marina — the Fish Market, the Docks, and a bar or two. The street is in deep shadow, protected from sunlight from almost any angle by its narrowness and by the height of the walls.

The Aquarium Bookstore is to the east. It is an esoteric bookstore (and purveyor of other things), but one whose owner has helped you in the past.

We can go northwest, southwest to the roundabout, east, and west from here.

The car is making an unpleasant raspy growl.

>nw
Since there's no way by road, we'll have to leave the car here. It is a moment's work to find a parking spot. We switch the ignition off.

We swing the car door open.

We climb out of the car.

Fish Market
Not very fishy at the moment, in fact: all the real trade happens in the early morning; then there is a period of tourist trade when the seafood sale tails off and most of the purchases are of polished conch shells and starfish; and then a little after noon the area clears out completely, leaving only briny rivulets on the concrete.

A tall, stern woman is standing in the middle of the market. She wears the black caped uniform of an Authenticator, and a monocle just like mine. And I don't think I want her to see us.

Just east of here is a rusting corrugated tin building, which was built to house various possessions of the fishermen.

>e
While the Authenticator's back is turned, we slip inside...

Tin Hut
Most of the light in here comes from circular windows punched into the tin walls just under the ceiling. From the inside, the building looks both larger and more sound than it appears from outside: there are plenty of sturdy struts supporting the roof and keeping the walls upright.

Various tarpaulin-covered masses fill the room.

A trap door is set in the floor.

Sometimes smugglers and forgers have been known to stash things in here, since the building is close to the docks but rarely attracts the interest of customs officials.

We catch our breath and look over our belongings to see if anything suspicious is showing. The monocle might be a little too conspicuous.

>climb masses
We identify the sturdiest-looking part of the construction and clamber onto it.

>look through window
We put an eye to one of the windows. The Authenticator is still in sight. Two assistants are in the middle of arresting a man for selling germ-based gems, but she is ignoring this play and looking for something or someone else.

>out
We get off the tarpaulin-covered masses.


>out
I don't think we want to show off the monocle around the Authenticator.

> put monocle in backpack
We open the backpack.

We gently remove the monocle.

We put the monocle into the backpack.

More racket comes in through the windows.

>out
I don't think we want to show off the P-remover and the monocle around the Authenticator.

> close backpack
We close the backpack.

>out
I don't think there's anything showing that should get us into trouble. Timidly we open the door; the Authenticator has her back to us. We slip out. She makes one more turn in place — monocled gaze sliding across us without stopping — and then she strides away to the north.

Fish Market

This road descends steeply from southwest to northwest, passing between white concrete buildings to provide access to the marina — the Fish Market, the Docks, and a bar or two. The street is in deep shadow, protected from sunlight from almost any angle by its narrowness and by the height of the walls.

The Aquarium Bookstore is to the east. It's dim inside, but occasional movements suggest that the proprietor, Slango's friend Lena, is inside.

Tall Street (jammed into the car)
We are jammed into the car with our knees almost at our chin, looking out through the bulbous little windshield. The motor is growling like a housecat with pneumonia.

Tall Street is very quiet. No celebrations have reached this far, and neither is there any business today; so it has an air of dull abandonment. At the east end the street bends to go around an old park rarely visited.

To the south is the important blue rotunda of the Bureau of Orthography. The street runs west towards the busy roundabout.

The car is making an unpleasant raspy growl.

Counterfeit Monkey
Infamously this pub was raided in 1929, the year that the Bureau developed its first meager attempt at an Authentication Scope, and dozens of smugglers and fraudulent businessmen went to jail. But neither that raid nor subsequent scrutiny has ever shut the place down entirely. Built when people were a bit shorter and ceilings were a bit lower, the Counterfeit Monkey is always smoky and never well lit, even in the middle of the day.

The clientele are currently engaged in a game of darts, while the barman watches and practices a sarcastic wit on those who embarrass themselves. There is also a quantity of Origin Paste sitting out on the bar.

Parker acknowledges our return with a nod.

I'd like to ask whether we can have the Origin Paste.

Crawlspace
An awkward, low, concrete-lined crawlspace beneath the tin hut. It smells somewhat like animals; in spite of this it clearly gets a bit more use than anyone would like the customs officials to know about.

The only significant thing down here is a crate.

Crawlspace
An awkward, low, concrete-lined crawlspace beneath the tin hut. It smells somewhat like animals; in spite of this it clearly gets a bit more use than anyone would like the customs officials to know about.

The trap door, wedged open by a stick, admits the only light.

The only significant thing down here is a crate.

>wave t-remover at stick
The stick gives way to the now-familiar sick.

>purloin britishizing goggles
[Purloined.]

>wear britishizing goggles
We put on the Britishising goggles. An experimental prototype that (from the perspective of the viewer only) adds -u- into words ending in -or, and reverses -er into -re wherever possible. Subjects wearing the Britishising goggles generally began to develop implausible accents and to have better than usual success wooing American tourists. Otherwise, the goggles are not much use: like my monocle, they don't affect the actual form of an object in any way.

The surplus stock were mostly given away as rewards to supporters of public television, and the Bureau discouraged even recreational use in the 1980s as they began to make progress towards greater linguistic purity.

From this slightly raised terrace, tourists have a view of the activity in the market and out over the docks.

Curiously, there's an acquaintance of yours here: Nexami Engeo is at one of the round black metal tables. He's a musician, the front man of engeo. Your gang helped him out with some customs issues because of his unusual name.

Nexami nods to us. "Watch out. That table next to you has something sticky spilled on it." And indeed there is a spill. You were about to lean on it nonchalantly.

We want to say thanks for pointing out spill or ask what he is doing in Atlantis.

Private Beach
This is little more than a strip of fine yellow sand, perhaps twenty meters from side to side, and five from the hillside to the waterline. A little sage grows on the hillside, escaped from some garden, along with wilder plants.

Precarious Perch
From up here there's a handsome view of the sea, which isn't so far down really. But it's a scramble down a nearly sheer cliff for the first bit, until we make it down to the rockfall below, and it would be easy for a careless person to injure herself.

It's hard to see through the tall window to the room behind: mostly it reflects the sea.

We are equipped with the following essentials: a backpack, a flash drive, a monocle, some Origin Paste, some plans, your R-remover, and a tube.

We are also carrying an apple, a card, a stick, a tomcat, and a twig.

The flash drive and the monocle are in the backpack, which is closed for greater concealment.

/We reset the device to s. There is a [a-z  \-]+, and the pans turn into a pan. An omelet-sized skillet in cast iron.

>wave d-remover at card
We reset the device to d. With a distinct whiff of metal parts and oil, the card turns into a car. It is little larger than a toy, but that is what you want when driving on the streets around here. Any substantial vehicle wouldn't fit down the winding drives.

Here is how my mother gets around. She takes a 300 Euro Hermès scarf with an orange border and a pattern of prancing horses. She tosses it in the air. As it falls, she shoots it twice, like a clay pigeon: once to take out the F, the second time for the S. And such a car: buttery leather seats, jaguar lines. If someone asks how she gets such good results, she jokes that it's because of her quality materials.

Suffice it to say that we are not similarly blessed.

The car is far too large for us to carry, and falls onto the floor.

>gonear rotunda
(the Rotunda)
Rotunda
Echoing space, marble floor, eye-like skylight many meters above us: so far, the Rotunda might belong to any 19th-century government bureau of means and self-importance.

What sets this one apart is the lettering, each sigil no bigger than a flea, carved over every inch of the walls. Inscribed here is, in fact, the entire text of A New Orthodox Orthography, which means that if we had a great deal of patience and many rolls of butcher paper, we could take rubbings and wind up with our very own volume.

We don't, of course. There are better things to do. More important places to go. The administrative part of the bureau is away to the south, and there is an exhibit of letter tools to the east, which is open to the public.

/Near the street entrance is a sizable informational bulletin-board advertising the services of the Bureau; and next to this, pushed back to be out of the way, is a bin. (There is a shuttle in the bin|In the bin is a shuttle).

These are what you and Brock were originally contracted to lift from the island, at a fee in the multiple millions.

We try hiding the plans in the backpack before approaching the secretary ahead, but they are too long to fit. We decide to stay where we are for now.

Sigil Street
The buildings here are two and three stories, with shops at ground level and elderly apartments above. The shops are closed for the holiday: a typographer's office, tourist boutiques of colorful skirts and ethnic bodices (rarely if ever worn by natives) and t-shirts covered with font designs.

Whatever is scheduled for later showing has not started yet, and is probably not destined to start for some time; at any rate, the screen is blank and no audience has yet assembled.

My backpack is stowed under a seat in the third row from the back. I figured that it would be undisturbed there for a couple of hours, in the dark and out of sight, and if anyone found it they would probably turn it in to Lost and Found. But it is a big relief to find it still there.

"Hey," says the girl. "Do you think this place is safe?" she asks conspiratorially.

I must look blank, because she goes on, "I saw this documentary once, right, about a serial killer who went from youth hostel to youth hostel, grooming girls and killing them. And then he'd chop up the bodies and put the body parts into the lockers. And no one would find out until he'd gone away again."

This area used to be a sort of antechamber where the priests and choir might gather for processions into the church, but it has now been done over for retail purposes. This is one of several schemes to make the New Church pay for its own upkeep: a problem is that people somehow feel everything associated with a church ought to be free, including lunchtime concerts, potluck suppers, and Thursday-night lecture series.

It's an old building with big arched windows and faded floorboards, and in the afternoon the schoolyard smells of spilled milk going sour in the sun. From this direction there's not much to see but the screen of palm trees in front.

>x palm
They aren't the very tall and graceful kind, but a stumpier variety, forming a sort of vegetative colonnade in front of the school building. There's some gum stuck to the base of the nearest tree.

Gum adheres to one of the palm trees, left no doubt by some departing school kid.

If you look just north between the houses, you'll notice also the footpath down to an almost-private beach. It used to be open, but it's now gated off, and built into the gate is a chic modern sculpture.

We slip between the houses and down a path that looks as though it might lead to someone's back yard. No one has ever put up signage to correct this misapprehension because no one who lives around here is eager to encourage strangers on the private beach.

Soon, however, the footpath begins to descend purposefully towards the level of the ocean.

There is a dismissive blatt from the monocle, and transposed over the kudu is a faint, greenish image of some kudzu.

The kudu looks at us cleverly for a moment and then bounds away.

>look behind bushes
Hunting behind the bushes reveals something I vaguely remember seeing when I was a child, but not noticing again since: built into the wall is what looks like a very ancient sort of shrine.

>put god in shrine
We stand the god up in the niche in a place of solemn honor. It fits perfectly, as though shaped for just this use.

For a moment, with the air still and hot, and no one visible in any direction, we might almost believe that the past two millennia have been nothing, and that the shrine is fresh and new.

But Anglophone Atlantis prefers to forget what it was.

Achievement accomplished: Jocasta Higgate award for reconstructing pagan worship on the island!

We continue down until there is a chink of a view of the sea. Then the path descends through a few last hairpin twists among rocks, and comes out suddenly on a little beach.

This is little more than a strip of fine yellow sand, perhaps twenty meters from side to side, and five from the hillside to the waterline. A little sage grows on the hillside, escaped from some garden, along with wilder plants. Above, at the top of that slope, are houses with balconies overlooking the sea, but from this angle it's impossible to see much of them, or for them (you'll have to take my word on this) to see us.

The shop takes its name from the collection of fish mounted on every wall: swordfish, bass, other things I don't recognize. Underneath these dubious tokens, the walls are covered with bookshelves, and there are stacks of books on the floor where the shelves have proven insufficient.

The merchandise consists mainly, but not exclusively, of books, and the selection caters to odd tastes. You once picked up in here a book about a man who R-removed a wrench, and then had his way with it. You and Brock had a good time with that one for the next month and a half.

Lena is present, all right. In fact she watches us keenly the instant we come into the shop. Lena is an associate of Slango's. You hadn't realized that had crossed over into a romance. Slango has never, ever in your recollection dated anyone. And now this.

Fish Market
Not very fishy at the moment, in fact: all the real trade happens in the early morning; then there is a period of tourist trade when the seafood sale tails off and most of the purchases are of polished conch shells and starfish; and then a little after noon the area clears out completely, leaving only briny rivulets on the concrete.

A tall, stern woman is standing in the middle of the market. She wears the black caped uniform of an Authenticator, and a monocle just like mine. And I don't think I want her to see us.

Just east of here is a rusting corrugated tin building, which was built to house various possessions of the fishermen.

>e
While the Authenticator's back is turned, we slip inside...

Tin Hut
Most of the light in here comes from circular windows punched into the tin walls just under the ceiling. From the inside, the building looks both larger and more sound than it appears from outside: there are plenty of sturdy struts supporting the roof and keeping the walls upright.

Various tarpaulin-covered masses fill the room.

A trap door is set in the floor.

Sometimes smugglers and forgers have been known to stash things in here, since the building is close to the docks but rarely attracts the interest of customs officials.

We catch our breath and look over our belongings to see if anything suspicious is showing. The P-remover, the monocle, and the plans might be a little too conspicuous.

Above, at the top of that slope, are houses with balconies overlooking the sea, but from this angle it's impossible to see much of them, or for them (you'll have to take my word on this) to see us.

Something green and plastic just barely pokes out of the sand.

We squeeze ourselves against the wall and angle to reach the screws with the screwdriver. I start on the first screw when—

"Is someone in the Seminar Room?" asks a male voice in the hall. "I thought I heard something."

"I don't think so."

There's a listening silence from outside. We hold absolutely still.

Finally the footsteps move away again. It's probably safe to try again now, when I'm feeling a tiny bit calmer.

This corner office was won in a battle of wills with several other departments during the most recent rebuilding drive. Professor Waterstone is fond of reminding the others that he was the one to obtain this favorable position whenever there is a disagreement about procedure.

>n

Waterstone's Office
A very finicky, neatly arranged room, in which one never feels quite at home.

Professor Waterstone is sitting here. Waterstone is my dissertation advisor. (He insists on the "o" spelling.) He's an expert in the history of linguistic and orthographical power, but he's politically kind of reactionary. "Don't meddle" is pretty much his motto.

We can see an invitation on a desk. It's from Dental Consonants Limited. Their design of stationery is unmistakable.

In front of Professor Waterstone is a small laptop.

He looks up at us gravely. "I don't believe we've met," he says. "Can I help you?"

/We (want to|could) make up some excuse, ask whether he met the activists, or ask why he is working on Serial Comma Day.

>show shuttlecock to waterstone
We are just about to show Professor Waterstone the shuttlecock, when he all of a sudden gets up from his chair.

"Look, I really must work on this," says Waterstone, chasing us to the door. "Perhaps someone else in the department can answer a few of your questions. I believe I saw Professor Higgate earlier, and Professor Brown is usually in his lab downstairs. I'm sure he's not working on anything too urgent. Goodbye!"

The office door closes with measured firmness behind us.

Through the window in Waterstone's door, we can see him turning the lock. When he catches us watching he gives a tight, unfriendly smile and goes back to his desk.

A moment later the printer whirs thoughtfully.

Professor Waterstone looks up at us through the window in the door, as if to ask "Yes? Was there something you wanted to show me?"

>put member in backpack
We put the member into the backpack.

>knock
Waterstone looks up and gives a little frown. It's clear he doesn't know why we knocked. The shuttlecock might interest him, but perhaps he can't see it from that angle. Maybe if we were holding it.

>show member to waterstone
Waterstone is unable to hear you through the closed door, which is presumably the purpose of closing it, so let's try knocking instead.

Waterstone glares at the member. Then he picks up a marker and writes on a piece of paper, "Yes, but how to change its name to something innocent?" Having held up this sign for a minute, he crumples it and goes back to work.

If he were a cartoon there would be a thundercloud over his laptop.

>show shuttlecock to waterstone
Waterstone is unable to hear you through the closed door, which is presumably the purpose of closing it, so let's try knocking instead.

Waterstone looks at the shuttlecock, briefly arrested by some thought. He gets a monocle like mine out of his drawer. He looks through it at the shuttlecock, notes the shuttle and the cock; grins. He gets up and comes out of his office.

"This is perfect," he says. "One more example to put into my talk — but I really should be going — should be able to get a ride from my wife — if I leave now — Here, you can have this if it interests you. I won't have time to use it." He sets an invitation down on the desk.

"Come back and talk to me again later," he adds. "We can discuss your goals as a student. And now I really have to go — should have gone hours ago." (There, see: he can be a nice man. More or less.)

He locks his door again and goes out. I think he is actually humming something.

Before we can do anything, Waterstone pops his head back in. "What you did there — not strictly within the rules. But I admire, shall we say, Realpolitik. You'll go far. Ignore Brown, but you'd probably do that anyway. Never talk to Higgate at all. I will see you later."

And he pops back out.

Fleur d'Or Drinks Club
The back wall is dramatically decorated with bottled liquors of all sorts, from gin to cachaça; there's a giant bottle of Campari, taller than your average three-year-old, with a red ribbon around its neck.

What makes this place technically a drinks club rather than a bar is its license to serve letter-manufactured food and drink. A toolkit on the bar contains some screwdrivers, some gimlets, and some rusty nails, ready to be transformed into their respective cocktails.

The bartender is in the middle of showing her homonym paddle to a patron holding a gin and tonic. The other patrons are scattered around the room at small tables, drinking or talking among themselves.

She acknowledges us with a nod as we stroll up to the bar and get close enough to hear their conversation. "It was originally produced as a toy, but it's actually a bit dangerous," the bartender is saying.

"Dangerous? How so?" asks the patron.

"Various ways," she says. "Suppose I hit a small object that has a big homonym, like say a plane. You know, the carpentry kind. Suddenly I've got an airplane-style plane on top of me."

>x toolkit

She holds up the paddle as though she's going to tap him with it.

"Uh... my name is Mark," he says.

They recently redid this room, and whoever picked the decorations had postmodern tastes.

The bookshelves lining the walls contain the department library. There are History of the Standards Revolution and Lives of the Lexicographers on the bookshelf.

A massive plexiglas case takes up one corner of the room. In the plexiglas case is a compact but high-powered late model synthesizer.

The big table at the center of the room is an irregular polygon, with one chair pushed up to the shortest side. I think the shape is intended to undermine traditional conceptions of academic hierarchy, but in practice it just means that whoever gets to seminar late has to sit with a table angle jabbing him in the stomach.

Brown's Lab
Professor Brown, the Reification of Abstracts researcher, is hunched over his work table. Brown is only barely a professor at all — actually, his working title is Senior Lecturer, and he holds a yearly contract which the University has the option to renew at whim. This prevents him going elsewhere while ensuring that he never has a fully-funded lab of his own. All the electrical equipment down here is tinker-toys compared to the stuff he really wants; in fact, half of it he built himself with components he bought with his own money.

I know all this because Brown cornered me in the hallway one afternoon and talked to me for twenty minutes straight about the pressures of academic job-hunting in the current political climate. I tried to get him to stop, but he's like a wind-up toy.

"Don't touch anything, please," he says, without looking up.

Abandoned Park
In contrast with the parks in the more savory parts of town, this is a bit of patchy grass where local dogs occasionally come out to do their business. A granite war memorial is fixed at the center, which is why tourist maps optimistically call the place Monument Green. But the memorial is only moderately monumental and the grass hardly green at all.

We step on a twig before we back away again.

It is a place that might have been developed long ago; only it is known that there are remains of Roman settlement here, and there is a risk that digging out the foundations would turn up some of those ruins, exposing a large number of Latin-language objects to the light of day. To prevent this catastrophe the whole area has been placed off limits to development.

We can go southeast and west from here.

>x memorial
It's a curious thing: it stands taller than a person and yet seems almost embarrassed and self-effacing. The lettering is cut quite small, and the names thereon are tightly spaced. Since 1829 there have been only thirty-five officially sanctioned surnames on the island, which means that, for reasons of space, the names have been truncated to numbers, and the result is a list that looks almost like a table of Biblical quotations: John 31, Mark 12, Paul 29.

The reason for all this compactness is that the memorial is dedicated to the dead of all wars. Deaths from the War of Secession and the Civil Dispute of Standardization, losses from islanders volunteering in the French Foreign Legion, and the hefty cost of World Wars I and II, all are crammed into the upper left corner, leaving room for a long and bloody future.

On the war memorial is a poppy.

Soon, however, the footpath begins to descend purposefully towards the level of the ocean.

Hunting behind the bushes reveals something I vaguely remember seeing when I was a child, but not noticing again since: built into the wall is what looks like a very ancient sort of shrine.

At the center of the room is a gleaming new T-inserter Machine. This is a state of the art device: letter removal has been well understood for decades, but insertion is much more dangerous and difficult, fraught with ambiguity.

>x automaton
It's a robotic head inside a glass box. When turned on, it gives out fortunes. There's an old-fashioned carnival feel about the thing, and the fact that it's a portable size makes it a good candidate for traveling fairs.

The seer automaton is currently switched off.

>put automaton in inserter
There is a loud and satisfying pop from the machine as it turns the seer automaton into a steer automaton.

Real leather covers a framework of wood and steel, making an alert and surprisingly lifelike model steer.

The steer automaton is currently switched off.

Of course, there were other options there: the T-inserter could have made two words. But it seems to be disambiguating to the steer automaton. The question now is whether it would do so consistently or whether its behavior is underdetermined; we don't have time for a really thorough trial set, but checking a couple more times may be indicative.

[Your score has gone up by one point and is now nine.]

>get it
/We (take|get|pick up|acquire) the steer automaton.

>gel it
We dip out a pea-sized quantity of gel and rub it gently onto the steer automaton. With an audible SPLORT, the steer automaton becomes a seer automaton.

>put it in inserter
There are two small pops from the machine as it turns the seer automaton into a setter automaton. It's a little like one of those Japanese robot dogs, only substantially more old-fashioned and artisanal. Its bright glass eyes watch us expectantly and its ruddy fur is thick and lustrous.

The setter automaton is currently switched off.

There now: the T-inserter has constructed both steer automaton and setter automaton. Not very stable, it seems. Slango will be interested to know that.

>out
(heading northeast, since that is the only direction available)

So you want us both to get caught? Well, I'm not up for that arrangement. What we are doing here is important. I say we send Brock and get out of here.

>gel rock
We dip out a pea-sized quantity of gel and rub it gently onto the rock. With an audible SPLORT, the rock becomes Brock. He looks a bit haggard to me, but I don't think anything too horrible has happened to him. So perhaps you can stop worrying.

I'm starting to understand how you got into all the places you got into. Not that I judge you or your line of work, of course.

You're silent. I'm not letting you act again. You're not stopping me.

"We're still inside the Bureau basement," I say. "We just need to head out, separately."

He looks puzzled. "Aren't we safer together?"

"No," I say.

"But—"

"Look, just trust me, this once," we say.

Brock backs out the door. Loud sounds of an arrest ensue. I hear my father's voice, and two other people. Then finally the sounds die away.

"It's weird — you have a different face but the expressions are still yours. It's like you have a really good rubber mask on."

A faint spell comes over me and I feel dizzy.

We gel the nearest of the objects, and it comes to life: a woman in her thirties or forties, at first so motionless that she looks like a statue, until she remembers that she can move.

"Thank goodness," says the woman. "I felt like I was going to lose myself if I had to spend another minute in there. I don't know who you are, but thank you, thank you! Is there a Bureau reprieve? Please tell me they've decided to let us all out!"

"No general reprieve," you say. "Just you."

This isn't what I want. It's not just unfair; it's actually monstrous. "What were you put in for?" I ask.

"Italian," she whispers.

"What?"

"I was learning Italian," she says. "I wanted to read Manzoni. There was no sympathy from the officers; they thought it was an inexplicable desire. Is it daylight or night-time out there? Not that it matters. I haven't seen either in so long."

You gesture at the door. She looks at us once more, doubtfully, and goes.

From the corridor comes the sound of a shot being fired from a restoration gel rifle; the woman exclaiming in pain; officers gathering around her for the arrest. And she'll be back here, I suppose, before the night is out. I suppose that allows you to tell yourself that it wasn't a bad thing, what we just did.

The equipment shelves here display an assortment of obsolete, broken, foreign, or otherwise unusual letter tools. There are an accent flipper, an umlaut punch, a Catalan punt volat needle, some broken components, and some lamb granulates on the equipment shelves.

The functional area continues to the south, and the hallway is west.

>gel lamb granulates
We dip out a pea-sized quantity of gel and rub it gently onto the lamb granulates. With an audible SPLORT, the lamb granulates become some anagram bullets. Heavy, high-impact stuff. Anagramming requires a great deal of force to break the linguistic cohesion of the word or phrase being modified. On the other hand, it's the one process that is routinely effective even on adjective-adhering nouns.

I'm starting to understand how you got into all the places you got into. Not that I judge you or your line of work, of course.

It's hard to imagine any self-respecting hatter constructing such a confection, but an anagramming gun is a powerful thing.

There is — really there is the faintest suspicion that it's trying to spell itself "crêpe". Must be the foreign ingredients.

Sunning Deck (aboard the True Macaque)
This is a very fine boat: sleek, shiny, big... Oh, you don't like it when I put it that way, I see. All right then: a high-speed yacht, something luxurious enough that it looks like a rich man's toy to harbor officials, but it handles almost like a cigarette boat. Fiberglass hull, shaped in a deep V for racing, capable of 80 knots on a calm sea. Range of around 300 nautical miles, enough to take us past Gibraltar to Málaga or perhaps even Almeria.

This bit is the aft portion, broad and flat and suitable for sunning oneself.

Fixed on the roof above the entry to the navigation area is a white object that looks a little like an igloo. It is the communication unit that handles the yacht's wifi connection.

>fore

Navigation Area (aboard the True Macaque)
A command chair waits at the controls, a mass of buttons and levers and a tiny, low-mounted steering wheel that seems like an awfully small device to control such a high-powered machine. But I'll take your word that it works.

The Galley is just below, down a steep staircase that is almost a ladder.

>fore

Foredeck (aboard the True Macaque)
Here the yacht is nothing but a nose over the water. A hatch, hardly big enough for a portly person, descends into the so-called crew cabin.

>down

Galley (aboard the True Macaque)
Smaller than the kitchen in a comfortable house, but carefully and elegantly fitted, with an electric stovetop, a convection oven/microwave, a tiny refrigerator, a sink: enough, in short, to serve the crew of three on long trips. I guess even a fairly big boat is still small on the inside, eh?

There's even a little washing machine, for items too big to hand-wash in the sink.

On the port wall, built-in shelves hold a battered selection of games.

>gonear dormitory room
Dormitory Room
Painted off-white, with hard wood floors under many layers of protective gloss coating: there are no surfaces in this room that would take a stain. Four dorm beds are lined up against the wall.

The locker you identify as your own sits near one of the beds, still locked with its dial lock.

A girl of about 19 is standing in the middle of the room, looking around as though she can't quite believe where she landed or what she's doing here. She is carrying a heavy pack and wearing a pink t-shirt.

"Hey," says the girl. "Do you think this place is safe?" she asks conspiratorially.

I must look blank, because she goes on, "I saw this documentary once, right, about a serial killer who went from youth hostel to youth hostel, grooming girls and killing them. And then he'd chop up the bodies and put the body parts into the lockers. And no one would find out until he'd gone away again."

Nothing like that has happened around here, but she seems to get a charge out of scaring herself with this story.

My response would be to ask for privacy.

Brock's Stateroom
It was early morning, almost a year ago now. A dim light came through the portholes. A four-thousand dollar mink blanket covered your hip.

You sat up and started fishing around beside the bed, in the dove-grey shadows, for your bra.

Brock put a hand on your thigh. It seems you woke him.

"That wasn't your first time," he said.

"No." You were still feeling for the underpants and the shirt, not looking at him.

"Well. You're made of human after all." Brock stretched, grinned. "After breakfast I'll clear you some drawer space."

"This was a one-night event," you said. "You're familiar with the concept."

He got very still. Then he got out of bed. Without looking at you, he got his trunks out of his drawer. "I'm going for a swim."

Then we're back in the present.

Navigation Area
Brock was sitting at the controls, with you leaning over him. He pushed you away. "Cut it out. I'm not available every time you decide to go slumming."

It was deep blue summer twilight. He was driving the yacht with one hand on the steering wheel and the other loosely in his lap. You turned to go.

Then we're back in the present.

Sunning Deck
Brock was sprawled out on the cushions with his sunglasses on. Pretending not to see you. You stood so that your shadow crossed his face and he had to look up.

"I've been a jerk and I'm sorry," you said.

"I'm not the man-whore of Babylon," he replied. "I've had the odd fling. That's all."

"I know."

"I'm not James Bond here."

You pulled your towel more tightly around you. "I know."

"And you have lost the right ever to give me crap about women again," he said.

Your teeth were starting to chatter. "Yes."

"Okay. Apology accepted." He lowered his sunglasses again.

Then we're back in the present.

Café, Marseilles
Brock was scowling into his drink. "I don't know, Andra. Are you going to flip on me again if we try to be together? I'm not blaming you for your parents, and... honestly, I'm surprised how much you've been able to assemble yourself into someone new. But jeezus."

"What happened to your thing about how everyone goes through life hurting everyone else a little bit, like radiation?" you asked. "But mostly people heal, and it's worth it?"

"Yeah, that's true," he said. "But you still don't go into the reactor core with no suit, if you see what I mean."

You tilted your head. "You weathered it pretty well when you and Annalisa split up."

He swirled the melted ice in the bottom of his glass. "Is this what you're fishing for?" he said. "For me to tell you you're special, you're different, I care about you more and therefore it would ruin everything if we ever broke up?"

You didn't answer.

"It would ruin everything," he says. "Because you're on my crew. But as to the girlfriend thing, I have no idea. We don't know each other that way."

Then we're back in the present.

Brock's Stateroom
Brock had tied your wrists to the headboard and your left ankle to the corner of the bed. He had a thesaurus open and was writing, with a paintbrush, across your stomach.

"Floozy?" he asked.

You giggled, so he painted the word above your navel, smiling, giving the Y a big flourishing curlicue.

"Let's see, what else. Fornicator?"

You drew in your breath sharply. Remembering an angry lesson read from the lectern.

"Okay," he said. "Not that one, yet," and licked away the F he'd begun to paint.

Then we're back in the present.

>shoot pea
(with the anagramming gun)
The gun fires ruggedly into the pea, which shatters and then reforms as an ape. It is very large.

The ape turns its face towards us and takes us in dislike. Its dislike involves a lot of hitting and ooking and throwing, and overall turns out quite painful.

We smoothly, and almost without thinking about it, reset your device to be a B-remover. There is a hum of ferocious effort from the letter-remover as it strains to create "all". At first it seems likely that it will just break down, but it gets through the aa (a spontaneous flow of lava) and the aardvark, before the aardwolf attacks and does us in.

We smoothly, and almost without thinking about it, reset your device to be a Y-remover. We wave the Y-remover at the army and produce an arm, severed (because after all it would be beyond the parameters of the change to generate the person whose body part it is). It is only moderately gory, and most locals get used to seeing this kind of thing as a prank from six-year-olds every halloween. Still, it might startle a tourist.

We draw the backpacking girl's attention to the arm.

The backpacking girl looks like throwing up. After a moment to regain her composure, she flees the vicinity.

>gonear sensitive equipment testing room
Sensitive Equipment Testing Room
A room with no windows, no cameras, no recording equipment, and barely any furniture.

A rock sits in one corner of the room.

At the center of the room is a gleaming new T-inserter Machine. This is a state of the art device: letter removal has been well understood for decades, but insertion is much more dangerous and difficult, fraught with ambiguity.

>purloin pita
[Purloined.]

>wave a-remover at pita
We run our thumb over the dial, setting the device to an A-remover. With a distinct whiff of apricot and cherry, the pita turns into a pit. The hard center of a fruit, clean and dry of any flesh.

>wave p-remover at pit
/We reset the device to p. There is a [a-z \-]+, and the pit turns into an it. It's itself. It. The epitome of itness. Philosophers would pay millions.

>wave t-remover at it
We reset the device to t. There is a distinct spearmint flavor, and the it turns into an I. It's an abstract that looks like a bit of mirror. When I look at it I see Alex, my proper self, and not just restored to my usual body, but photo-retouched to be that bit smarter and freer of skin-blemishes, well-dressed. It's like looking in the mirror at reality as it should be.

You doubtless see yourself too — as you are, or perhaps as you want to be.

>put i in t-inserter
There is a loud and satisfying pop from the machine as it turns the I into an it.

Of course, there were other options there: the T-inserter could have made two words. But it seems to be disambiguating to the it. The question now is whether it would do so consistently or whether its behavior is underdetermined; we don't have time for a really thorough trial set, but checking a couple more times may be indicative.

[Your score has gone up by one point and is now four.]

>get it
/We (take|get|pick up|acquire) the it.

The tit clambers out of the T-inserter machine.

There is a continuous angry whine from the jigsaw.

>gonear Hesychius Street
Hesychius Street
As the street names make obvious, this part of town was laid out in a different political age, when it was considered more important to commemorate linguistic richness than to standardize practices.

This is also the edge of the richest part of town, with houses — really, almost villas — that were built for households with servants. My parents' place is just a block or two north of here.

On holidays like today, this street is often host to a farmer's market; though it is now late enough in the day that most of the farmers have given up and gone home, taking with them their twenty-three varieties of pickled olives, their loganberry jam, and their pigs'-feet-in-aspic.

One remaining farmer lazes here, watching his stall.

The farmer makes a little cluck sound which seems to mean that he sees us but doesn't care to waste an entire syllable on acknowledging it.

"What is for sale?" we ask.

"We have available some asparagus, a lime, and a yam," the farmer replies.

"I'll have the yam, please," we say.

"Sure thing," says the farmer.

My response would be to recommend other vegetables.

Webster Court
Hesychius Street opens here into a broad and plainly-paved court.

Lending its name to the location is a bronze statue of Noah Webster. My mother likes to irritate my father by quoting what his contemporaries called Webster: a "viper", a "maniacal pedant", and (always a favorite at Reform Day parties) "a toad in the service of sans-culottism". She makes sure to pronounce that in the most Parisian accent possible.

The large building just to the north — yes, the one in pale pink — is my parents' home. I think I mentioned that my parents were well off. My father works for the Bureau, embarrassingly, and my mother was born into the kind of money that we like to pretend doesn't exist on this island.

The streets continue south, east, and west; and just to the northeast is my parents' side garden.

>w

Roget Close
A pleasantly sheltered lane in which I learned to ride a bicycle, and where my friend Lucy used to live, before she and her parents moved off-island. Restrictions were looser even twenty years ago. Our old schoolhouse is just west of here.

If you look just north between the houses, you'll notice also the footpath down to an almost-private beach. It used to be open, but it's now gated off, and built into the gate is a chic modern sculpture.

>put yam on pedestal
We put the yam on the pedestal.

The mirror rotates in leisurely fashion, and when it is done there is a May.

This is the sheet for the month of May, torn from a calendar. Someone has put a gold star on the 21st, and "Dinner with the Shaplys" is penciled onto the 30th.

There is a dismissive blatt from the monocle, and transposed over the May is a faint, greenish image of a yam.

The gate clicks open.

We can't reasonably carry the whole stack of pans, so they fall to the ground with a dramatic crash.

>put pans on spinner

Winding Footpath
The footpath winds between the villas, sloping steeply downward. It is narrow, and bushes left and right conceal it even from the windows of the people living nearby.

The buildings here are two and three stories, with shops at ground level and elderly apartments above. The shops are closed for the holiday: a typographer's office, tourist boutiques of colorful skirts and ethnic bodices (rarely if ever worn by natives) and t-shirts covered with font designs.

Passing by the reflective window we catch the sight of our single blended body, and it creeps me out.

A narrow alley runs between buildings to the south, while the street continues east.

>remove monocle
We gently remove the monocle.


>x reflection
I have not gotten used to what we look like since we were synthesized into a single female body. The face that looks back is deeply scary. It's not me. And it's not you either. It's more like one of those computer composites you can have done to envision future offspring: if you and I were to have a somewhat androgynous daughter she might look like this.

But I am uncomfortable sharing a body, and uncomfortable looking into a mirror and seeing something other than my own face looking out.

You seem calmer about it: perhaps you've just had more time to reflect, or perhaps somehow you're filtering those emotions out for me. But I think we'll both be happier when we're split back into our own respective bodies.

Painted off-white, with hard wood floors under many layers of protective gloss coating: there are no surfaces in this room that would take a stain. Four dorm beds are lined up against the wall.

The locker you identify as your own sits near one of the beds, still locked with its dial lock.

We can also see a lap here.

>use gel on lock
We dip out a pea-sized quantity of gel and rub it gently onto the lock. With an audible SPLORT, the lock becomes a clock and falls to the floor. It appears to be one of those archetypal alarm clocks that crows at sunrise and generally makes a nuisance of itself. It shows the time to be about twenty-five past eleven.

The ceiling is mirrored, perhaps to make it harder for anyone to sneak around without being noticed among the shelves.

The equipment shelves here display an assortment of obsolete, broken, foreign, or otherwise unusual letter tools. On the equipment shelves are an accent flipper, an umlaut punch, a Catalan punt volat needle, and some broken components.

The functional area continues to the south, and the hallway is west.

>put asparagus in punch
We put the asparagus into the wire basket of the umlaut punch. There is a hum as the punch warms up, then a bang! as the tines come down sharply, tattooing the asparagus.

Briefly the asparagus appears as the progressive metal band Asparagüs, before fading back to itself: there just isn't enough energy to hold the conversion, given Asparagüs's fading reputation. Their song "Spears in Vinegar" was seventeen minutes too long to play on the radio.

When they are gone, a power chord remains in the air.

The repeated power chord makes it sound as though some heavy equipment is being used in here even when it's not.

Subjects wearing the Britishising goggles generally began to develop implausible accents and to have better than usual success wooing American tourists. Otherwise, the goggles are not much use: like my monocle, they don't affect the actual form of an object in any way.

The surplus stock were mostly given away as rewards to supporters of public television, and the Bureau discouraged even recreational use in the 1980s as they began to make progress towards greater linguistic purity.

>put gimlet in cryptolock
There is a churning noise from within the brushed steel bucket and "gomlit" appears in letters of hot pink smoke. Then the smoke dissipates without result.

>put earring in cryptolock
We get the gimlet. A gimlet is a hand-tool for drilling holes, like an auger but smaller. I haven't met many examples before, but this one is presumably typical: it has a steel shaft with a screw-end for drilling the holes, and a crosswise handle at the top.

There is a churning noise from within the brushed steel bucket and "ierrong" appears in letters of hot pink smoke. Then the smoke dissipates without result.

>put pastis in cryptolock
We take the earring. A twinkling diamond pendant earring, the sort rich women wear to deluxe evening occasions. It is your expert eye, not mine, that determines it is not zirconium, and notes the "950 platinum" stamp on the metal.

There is a churning noise from within the brushed steel bucket, and a moment later we see inside some pestos. Glass jars contain three types of local pesto: a traditional basil and garlic variety, a sun-dried tomato pesto, and the infamous squid-flake pesto. The jars are packaged in a glossy cardboard box, suitable for taking back to one's mother-in-law after a trip to Atlantis.

Attached to the machine is a brushed steel bucket, with insulated walls; it looks like a large version of an ice bucket for chilling sparkling wines.

Around the outside of the bucket are all sorts of odd gears, sprockets, parts, and bits, which have been attached in a haphazard way with bolts, wire, and duct tape. Presumably this does something to items placed in the bucket.

At the lip of the bucket is a switch labeled REVERSE. The switch is currently on.

In the brushed steel bucket is a tab.

>put tab in bucket
We momentarily lift the tab out of the brushed steel bucket and then drop it back in.

It isn't but a few seconds before a watchful parent notices the ho strutting around and goes to report her.

She is too stupid — as a constructed person — to put up much resistance when an officer shows up to escort her away.

It looks like it's a generic item from phrases like "to wish someone ill," which is a mercy; I don't think I would have liked manifesting illness, even abstractly.

Periodically it gains cartoonish eyes and eyebrows, and glowers at us.

>wave l-remover at ill
/We reset the device to l. There is a [a-z  \-]+, and the ill turns into an I. It's an abstract that looks like a bit of mirror. When I look at it I see Alex, my proper self, and not just restored to my usual body, but photo-retouched to be that bit smarter and freer of skin-blemishes, well-dressed. It's like looking in the mirror at reality as it should be.

You doubtless see yourself too — as you are, or perhaps as you want to be.

Dank and malodorous: there are no windows down here, and the drainage is terrible.

The stairs up are here; the lecture room at the east. Immediately south is the Graduate Student Office, and southwest is Professor Brown's office. The most interesting of all is the small door west, trying to look inconspicuous, but locked with a keycard lock: it's where the department stores its most dangerous licensed equipment.

A large open carton stands against the wall right between Brown's lab door and the interesting door. "Recycling," reads the sign over the carton. "Place your lab-created items here for processing." In the large carton is a banana.

From this slightly raised terrace, tourists have a view of the activity in the market and out over the docks.

Curiously, there's an acquaintance of yours here: Nexami Engeo is at one of the round black metal tables. He's a musician, the front man of engeo. Your gang helped him out with some customs issues because of his unusual name.

Nexami nods to us. "Watch out. That table next to you has something sticky spilled on it." And indeed there is a spill. You were about to lean on it nonchalantly.

We could say thanks for pointing out spill or ask what he is doing in Atlantis.

>wave s-remover at spill
The spill gives way to the now-familiar pill.

"Nice clean-up method," Nexami Engeo comments. "Beats using a rag." At least, I think that's what he said.

We could say thanks for pointing out spill, say that it's one of those things atlanteans learn, or ask what he is doing in Atlantis.

>take pill
We take the pill. It is small, round, and blue. There are no brand or generic markings to indicate what it might do.

Nexami stands up and mutters something. I have a little trouble with his Scottish accent — we don't get a lot of that around here, for obvious reasons — but you interpret it as him saying he'd better go pay up.

He heads into the interior of the café.

Dimly I wonder whether these symptoms correspond to any real medical condition or whether the pill is simply poisonous by invention; but we are not clear-minded enough to go on thinking these sorts of thoughts for long.

A massive plexiglas case takes up one corner of the room. There is a compact but high-powered late model synthesizer in the plexiglas case.

The big table at the center of the room is an irregular polygon, with one red chair pushed up to the shortest side. I think the shape is intended to undermine traditional conceptions of academic hierarchy, but in practice it just means that whoever gets to seminar late has to sit with a table angle jabbing him in the stomach.

We run our thumb over the dial, setting the device to a P-remover. We wave the P-remover at the pear and produce an ear, severed (because after all it would be beyond the parameters of the change to generate the person whose body part it is). It is only moderately gory, and most locals get used to seeing this kind of thing as a prank from six-year-olds every halloween. Still, it might startle a tourist.

Most of the room is taken up with a gigantic boiler installation that is currently off. The locking mechanism is a brushed steel bucket, currently empty.

>put tear in bucket
There is a churning noise from within the brushed steel bucket, and a moment later we see inside a tier. It's represented as a certificate honoring a donor in the fifth "tier of giving".

>open tub
We open the tub, revealing some restoration gel.

>gel rock
(first removing the rock so Brock isn't squished by the T-inserter machine)
We pick up the rock. Heavy, dark, and roughly hexagonal, like a slice of basalt column.

We dip out a pea-sized quantity of gel and rub it gently onto the rock. With an audible SPLORT, the rock becomes Brock. He looks a bit haggard to me, but I don't think anything too horrible has happened to him. So perhaps you can stop worrying.

I'm starting to understand how you got into all the places you got into. Not that I judge you or your line of work, of course.

Brock stands, dusting himself off. He looks us up and down without expression, without any sign of recognition. "What day is it?" he asks.

"Still Serial Comma Day," you say. "Brock, it's me. And Alex, but I'm here."

The waxen look melts and he grins. "Thank god. It's harder than you'd expect being a rock."

We could suggest we get out of here, complain about Brock's recklessness, or rejoice that Brock is okay. Then again, we could just get to work so we can be out of here faster.

Brock roots around in his pockets and fishes out a sign. "I picked this up in the hallway, if it's any use," he says. He tosses it in the corner.

I'd like to suggest we get out of here, complain about Brock's recklessness, or discover why Brock got stuck here. Or, then again, there's always finishing the job.

We could suggest we get out of here, complain about Brock's recklessness, or discover why Brock got stuck here. Or, then again, there's always finishing the job.

>shoot rubber stamp with gun
The gun fires ruggedly into the rubber stamp, which shatters and then reforms as a rump stabber. He is of less than average height and carries a butterfly knife.

"I didn't have time to run the tests I wanted to run on the T-inserter. It'll take three minutes and then we can go. We need to do abstracts, animates, and a stability check."

The rump stabber looks rather awkward, and clambers out of our ineffective hold onto solid ground.

We could insist on leaving immediately or accept Brock's lunacy. Or, then again, there's always finishing the job.

>wave p-remover at rump stabber
With a distinct whiff of deodorant, the rump stabber turns into a rum stabber. She looks around in bewilderment, but there's no rum for her to attack.

He pauses, listening for noises outside. "If it can't do abstracts, the market value is going to be a lot lower because of the limited-depth trees."

>gel rum stabber
We dip out a pea-sized quantity of gel and rub it gently onto the rum stabber. With an audible SPLORT, the rum stabber becomes a rubber stamp. It is made to stamp two words: ETHICAL VETO. The discoloration shows it has indeed been used, though not, perhaps, very recently.

He knocks on the top of the T-inserter. Brock goes on about the importance of abstracts.

There is a churning noise from within the brushed steel bucket, and a moment later we see inside some pestos. Glass jars contain three types of local pesto: a traditional basil and garlic variety, a sun-dried tomato pesto, and the infamous squid-flake pesto. The jars are packaged in a glossy cardboard box, suitable for taking back to one's mother-in-law after a trip to Atlantis.

Fleur d'Or Drinks Club
The back wall is dramatically decorated with bottled liquors of all sorts, from gin to cachaça; there's a giant bottle of Campari, taller than your average three-year-old, with a red ribbon around its neck.

What makes this place technically a drinks club rather than a bar is its license to serve letter-manufactured food and drink. A toolkit on the bar contains some screwdrivers, some gimlets, and some rusty nails, ready to be transformed into their respective cocktails.

The bartender is in the middle of showing her homonym paddle to a patron holding a gin and tonic. The other patrons are scattered around the room at small tables, drinking or talking among themselves.

She acknowledges us with a nod as we stroll up to the bar and get close enough to hear their conversation. "It was originally produced as a toy, but it's actually a bit dangerous," the bartender is saying.

"Dangerous? How so?" asks the patron.

"Various ways," she says. "Suppose I hit a small object that has a big homonym, like say a plane. You know, the carpentry kind. Suddenly I've got an airplane-style plane on top of me."

The snap makes an, er, snapping noise.

"What if you hit something that doesn't mean anything else?" the patron asks. "Like a chicken?"

"Nothing," she says. "That's safe." As though to demonstrate, she smacks the paddle against her left buttock. "See? I don't get changed into a different bartender. Want to try?"

She holds up the paddle as though she's going to tap him with it.

"Uh... my name is Mark," he says.

"Maybe not, then!" she says, laughing brightly.

We draw the bartender's attention to the ring.

She shrugs good-naturedly, hits the ring with the paddle, and grins at us. We look down at what we're holding: It sounds like the ringing of an old-fashioned telephone, piercing and abrupt.

Snap! goes the snap.

"That was a little dangerous, wasn't it?" Mark asks. "If you had tapped me with that thing, wouldn't I be a giant X on the carpet now?"

"Not for long," the bartender says. "I do have some restoration gel for emergencies. Or I could just hit you again with the paddle. But there would be an incident report and I could lose my license. So, yeah, better not."

There is a loud and satisfying pop from the machine as it turns the giant pin into a giant pint.

There might seem to be some inherent contradiction about having a giant version of some standard measure: might as well say "a very long inch" or "an extra-heavy pound". Nonetheless, popular imagination apparently construes GIANT PINT to mean an outsized beer stein. Beer not included.

>shoot giant pint
(with the anagramming gun)
The gun fires ruggedly into the giant pint, which shatters and then reforms as a pig tat inn. Mercifully this manifested itself as a postcard from the supposed inn rather than the inn itself, or we might have been crushed at the moment of generation. The postcard is bad enough, though, as it depicts a bed and breakfast establishment in which every possible surface is dedicated to celebrating members of the Suidae family. There are pig vases and pig lamps, pig figurines and collectible pig plates, stuffed pigs, china pigs, carved pigs, embroidered pigs and tatted pigs, not to mention piggy banks and pig-shaped creamers. There are realistic pigs that might have come from a farm, and cartoon pigs that stand up on two legs and dance. In the background a somber oil painting depicts a miniature potbellied looking up into light bursting from the heavens, as though it were having a religious experience.

WE WELCOME YOU TO PORKERS, says pink cursive script along the bottom of the card.

Someone has applied a drop shadow to the lettering.

>wave g-remover at pig tat inn
We run our thumb over the dial, setting the device to a G-remover. There is a flash of psychedelic colors, and the pig tat inn turns into a pi tat inn. The resulting postcard represents a hostelry devoted to the concept of pi. The symbol is painted on the walls and carved in three dimensions and stitched on pillows, and the bedspreads are quilted with the digits of pi, lest one forget them in one's sleep.

>shoot pi tat inn

There is a loud and satisfying pop from the machine as it turns the titan pin into a titan pint.

>shoot titan pint

The gun fires ruggedly into the inapt sin, which shatters and then reforms as a satin pin. It's a little brooch, probably not very valuable, bearing a blue and white satin rosette.

There's a little inlet of shore here, mostly boulders with little sand, completely cut off from the dock area and sheltered by the curve of the rock so that it wouldn't be visible from the sea unless someone were very close in.

There is a squid in the tidal pools among the boulders.

A bollard is bolted to one of the rocks, which is curious considering the otherwise unused and inaccessible look of the spot.

>wave l-remover at bollard
We run our thumb over the dial, setting the device to an L-remover. With a distinct whiff of raw wood, the bollard turns into a board. It's a fairly generic plank — sort of pine, by the looks of it, though constructed things tend to be a little vague on niceties such as species — and looks like it's designed to be part of a new deck or somesuch thing.

>wave d-remover at board
We reset the device to d. With a distinct whiff of sweaty animal, the board turns into a boar. In the old days they used to hunt these animals, and I can understand the impulse. It's like a pig, but even uglier and bristlier, with long dangerous-looking tusky teeth coming out of both its top and bottom jaws.

The boar gives us a very nasty kind of look, and then — without any provocation, I'm sure — starts running right at us.

>wave b-remover at boar
We reset the device to b. Our hand is less than steady, but we manage to wave the letter-remover accurately enough.

The boar vanishes with a pop, and an oar falls harmlessly to the ground. It's a light sort of oar, almost a paddle. Still probably not the ideal thing for use with a kayak, but it'll do.

Open Sea (in the kayak)
The water stretches in all directions, but we can see off to the north where Slango's yacht is anchored, ready to bring us back aboard. Its metallic blue shape almost blends in with the water.

If we were further around the island to the east, we might be able to see bits of the drowned city: both the buildings that were legitimately destroyed when the land sunk into the sea, and the areas where during the Civil Dispute of Standardization the authorities dumped unwanted foreign archaeological artifacts. But here I'm afraid it's just shellfish and sand down there.

>get out
Any particular direction? To the west, the street turns into a monumental staircase leading to the old fortified area — your hostel should be up that way — while a cross street heads southeast towards the main roundabout.

>wave h-remover at chard
We reset the device to h. With a distinct whiff of crisp, snappy cardboard, the chard turns into a card. Not a playing card, as I might have expected, or a calling card, or even an index card, but a Tarot card, representing the Chariot. The vehicle is drawn by two prize horses, one black, one white. The driver appears to be having some difficulty keeping them together, to judge from the surly expression and the raised whip.

>wave d-remover at card
We reset the device to d. With a distinct whiff of metal parts and oil, the card turns into a car. It is little larger than a toy, but that is what you want when driving on the streets around here. Any substantial vehicle wouldn't fit down the winding drives.

Here is how my mother gets around. She takes a 300 Euro Hermès scarf with an orange border and a pattern of prancing horses. She tosses it in the air. As it falls, she shoots it twice, like a clay pigeon: once to take out the F, the second time for the S. And such a car: buttery leather seats, jaguar lines. If someone asks how she gets such good results, she jokes that it's because of her quality materials.

Suffice it to say that we are not similarly blessed.

The car is far too large for us to carry, and falls onto the ground.

>ask mechanic to fix car
"There appears to be something wrong with my car," we tell the mechanic.

He has the somewhat cow-like expression of all fake people, but he nods gravely and has a look. "It hasn't been maintained," he says, on inspection. "You got any motor oil?"

>show fuel to mechanic
I can't see what you're talking about.

"Do you have any fuel? Or do you know where we could find some?"

He chews on his tongue a couple of times and then notes that he heard gas comes from old plants.

Showing no sign of having had this conversation before, he checks over the car, then asks us if we have oil.

Showing no sign of having had this conversation before, he checks over the car, then asks us if we have oil.

>get in car
We open the car door: perhaps unsurprisingly, it comes without an effective lock system.

We get into the car.

>start car
The extremely primitive dial in front of us is pointing all the way to the left. I think that's its way of saying it's out of fuel. At any rate, the engine won't start.

>switch on car
There's no gas in the car; without fuel, it's not going far.

>switch on ignition
There's no gas in the car; without fuel, it's not going far.

>get out
We swing the car door open.

We climb out of the car.

>open tub
We open the tub, revealing some restoration gel.

>gel car
We dip out a pea-sized quantity of gel and rub it gently onto the car. With an audible SPLORT, the car becomes some chard.

I'm starting to understand how you got into all the places you got into. Not that I judge you or your line of work, of course.

[Your score has gone up by one point and is now three.]

>wave f-remover at foil
We reset the device to f. With a distinct whiff of mechanics and the summer time, the foil turns into some oil. A can of what appears to be motor oil. It is sludgy and black.

>wave d-remover at chard
We reset the device to d. With a distinct whiff of faint fishiness, the chard turns into a char. It's a troutlike freshwater fish of the northern countries. It is dead, needless to say, and would make someone a nice supper if they knew how to clean and cook it. Our skills, however, are not up to the task.

>wave h-remover at char
We reset the device to h. The char gives way to the now-familiar car.

>show oil to mechanic
"Will this work?" We hold out the oil.

"Should do," he says. Rolling up his sleeves, he goes to work on the car. There is no small amount of banging and muttering, but finally he stands back and announces that he believes it is now in working condition.

My response would be to thank the mechanic.

#yam
>gonear Hesychius Street
Hesychius Street
As the street names make obvious, this part of town was laid out in a different political age, when it was considered more important to commemorate linguistic richness than to standardize practices.

This is also the edge of the richest part of town, with houses — really, almost villas — that were built for households with servants. My parents' place is just a block or two north of here.

On holidays like today, this street is often host to a farmer's market; though it is now late enough in the day that most of the farmers have given up and gone home, taking with them their twenty-three varieties of pickled olives, their loganberry jam, and their pigs'-feet-in-aspic.

One remaining farmer lazes here, watching his stall.

>purloin roll
Which do you mean, the 1) roll or the 2) patching roll?
>1
[Purloined.]

>talk to farmer
We nod to the farmer.

The farmer makes a little cluck sound which seems to mean that he sees us but doesn't care to waste an entire syllable on acknowledging it.

I'd like to ask what is for sale.

>a what
"What is for sale?" we ask.

"We have available some asparagus, a lime, and a yam," the farmer replies.

I'd like to recommend other vegetables.

>buy yam
"I'll have the yam, please," we say.

"Sure thing," says the farmer.

I'm inclined to recommend other vegetables.

>unlegend
>go to roget close
We make the quick walk.

Roget Close
A pleasantly sheltered lane in which I learned to ride a bicycle, and where my friend Lucy used to live, before she and her parents moved off-island. Restrictions were looser even twenty years ago. Our old schoolhouse is just west of here.

If you look just north between the houses, you'll notice also the footpath down to an almost-private beach. It used to be open, but it's now gated off, and built into the gate is a chic modern sculpture.

>n
We lack a key that fits the gate.

>put yam on spinner
We put the yam on the pedestal.

The mirror rotates in leisurely fashion, and when it is done there is a May.

This is the sheet for the month of May, torn from a calendar. Someone has put a gold star on the 21st, and "Dinner with the Shaplys" is penciled onto the 30th.

The gate clicks open.

[Your score has gone up by one point.]

>n
We slip between the houses and down a path that looks as though it might lead to someone's back yard. No one has ever put up signage to correct this misapprehension because no one who lives around here is eager to encourage strangers on the private beach.

Soon, however, the footpath begins to descend purposefully towards the level of the ocean.

Winding Footpath
The footpath winds between the villas, sloping steeply downward. It is narrow, and bushes left and right conceal it even from the windows of the people living nearby.

Babel Café
Through many changes of management, this institution has fed the denizens of the university and ignored their semi-sedition.

A clerk in a white apron stands behind the long glass case. In the long glass case are a pocket-bread, a wrap, and a honey pastry triangle.

The tables are square wooden things painted dark blue (not the vibrant blue of the Bureau, but something closer to midnight), and the upper surfaces are découpaged with antique travel postcards.

A blue plaque is mounted on the wall.

The clerk grins at us in a welcoming way.

The clerk sets the pocket-bread out on the table.

"There you go — nice day for a picnic, isn't it?"

"What if you hit something that doesn't mean anything else?" the patron asks. "Like a chicken?"

"Nothing," she says. "That's safe." As though to demonstrate, she smacks the paddle against her left buttock. "See? I don't get changed into a different bartender. Want to try?"

She holds up the paddle as though she's going to tap him with it.

"Uh... my name is Mark," he says.

"Maybe not, then!" she says, laughing brightly.

>ask about paddle
"Tell me about that paddle," we say.

The cock lets out a half-crow.

"This item," says the bartender, flourishing it for you to see, "is a genuine licensed homonym paddle. Changes one item into another item as long as the two have identical names."

>show ball to bartender
"Check this out," we say, holding out the ball for inspection.

We hold up the ball. "Can you paddle this?" we ask.

The bartender laughs. "It might be fun to have a big dance in here but I think I'd get fired," she says.

The cock clucks.

"That was a little dangerous, wasn't it?" Mark asks. "If you had tapped me with that thing, wouldn't I be a giant X on the carpet now?"

"Not for long," the bartender says. "I do have some restoration gel for emergencies. Or I could just hit you again with the paddle. But there would be an incident report and I could lose my license. So, yeah, better not."

>show foil to bartender
We draw the bartender's attention to the foil.

"Now that is definitely too awesome to turn down. Swordfight!"

So we lunge at her with the foil, she defends with the paddle, there is a crackle of purple-white, and we're left holding a ball of crumpled aluminum.

People around the bar shout and whoop.

The cock lets out a half-crow.

"Whatever," you say, before she can get any more excited about Brock.

She smirks. Then she taps the legend with her paddle and it transforms into a proper map legend.

The cock clucks.

The bartender taps the card with the paddle. "Was this your card?" she asks, returning a card now representing the Magician.

Mark looks thoughtfully into his gin and tonic. "I hear that sometimes the Bureau turns people into inanimate objects as a criminal sentence. Is that true?"

For the first time, the bartender looks uncomfortable. "I just pour the drinks," she says. "Hey, you're almost out there! Let me give you a refill." And she busies herself getting down the Bombay Sapphire and refilling his drink.

"You ever tempted to paddle the Sapphire?" Mark asks. "Should be worth a lot."

Arbot Maps & Antiques
There is a large collection of vintage and antique maps under glass — the island of Atlantis as a whole, street maps of here and of Maiana, navigation maps of the harbor, and then maps of more distant places as well.

A stylish mannequin near the front sports a pair of Britishizing goggles.

Overseeing all this is a woman named Kate.

"Welcome to Arbot," says Kate. "Feel free to browse and ask me any questions you may have about the merchandise."

I'd like to ask which map was sold, ask what sort of demonstration, or ask whether Brock seemed upset.

You have a fleeting thought of how it started with Brock.

A stylish mannequin near the front sports a pair of Britishizing goggles.

Overseeing all this is a woman named Kate.

>x map
It's a detailed street map pretending to correspond to some remote South African town called Slangovia. Cryptic icons dot the surface. There is a legend in the lower right corner that appears to be a separate piece glued on.

>x legend
This legend tells of Iphis and Ianthe: Iphis, a girl raised in disguise as a boy, falls in love with her playmate Ianthe. She prays to the goddess Isis, who takes pity and transforms Iphis into a man, able to marry Ianthe after all.

It bears no obvious relation to the map of Slangovia.

Kate frowns at it. "Perhaps it's a story with some kind of local significance?" she suggests, after a moment.

"If your friend is missing, you could report him to the Bureau, you know," she says. "I believe they keep close tabs on academic and research visitors. They may well know where he is."

"Thank you," you say. "I don't think things are quite at that point." And they never will be, obviously.

You have a fleeting thought of how it started with Brock.

Arbot Maps & Antiques
There is a large collection of vintage and antique maps under glass — the island of Atlantis as a whole, street maps of here and of Maiana, navigation maps of the harbor, and then maps of more distant places as well.

A stylish mannequin near the front sports a pair of Britishizing goggles.

We can see a map of Slangovia here.

Kate is keeping an eye both on us and on the tall thin woman.

>a legend
"The legend on this map is unusual," we say. And it is, too — it's a short story instead of any kind of key to the symbols on the map.

Kate frowns at it. "Perhaps it's a story with some kind of local significance?" she suggests, after a moment.

It's a detailed street map pretending to correspond to some remote South African town called Slangovia. Cryptic icons dot the surface. There is a legend in the lower right corner that appears to be a separate piece glued on.

This legend tells of Iphis and Ianthe: Iphis, a girl raised in disguise as a boy, falls in love with her playmate Ianthe. She prays to the goddess Isis, who takes pity and transforms Iphis into a man, able to marry Ianthe after all.

It bears no obvious relation to the map of Slangovia.

Arbot Maps & Antiques
There is a large collection of vintage and antique maps under glass — the island of Atlantis as a whole, street maps of here and of Maiana, navigation maps of the harbor, and then maps of more distant places as well.

A stylish mannequin near the front sports a pair of Britishizing goggles.

Overseeing all this is a woman named Kate.

"Welcome to Arbot," says Kate. "Feel free to browse and ask me any questions you may have about the merchandise."

We could ask whether she has seen Brock.

>ask about brock
"Have you seen a man — maybe this morning — about this height, dark hair, very blue eyes, kind of cocky?"

There's a light of recognition. "Yes, he was in. A friend of my boss. He visited the shop and sold us a map he happened to have with him. Then they left, together. I believe there was some discussion of seeing a demonstration."

I'd like to ask which map was sold, ask what sort of demonstration, or ask whether Brock seemed upset.

Something makes you think of how it started with Brock.

[MEMORIES will list your currently active memories]

>x maps
We study the maps. One in the collection stands out: a map of Slangovia, framed like all the others but of suspiciously recent vintage.

>buy map
"I'll have this map of Slangovia," we say.

It is at this moment that we remember we don't have any money. We make up some nonsense about having had our wallet stolen. Kate does not quite look convinced, but does not summon the authorities, either.

I'd like to ask which map was sold, ask what sort of demonstration, or ask whether Brock seemed upset.

>ask about demonstration
"You mentioned that your boss and the other gentleman went to a demonstration. What kind of demonstration was it?"

She smiles and shrugs. "Mr. Arbot used to work for the Bureau before he retired to sell antiques. He still has lots of connections. It could be anything."

>ask about antiques
"So your boss used to work for the Bureau, but now he sells maps?"

"And other items. Some of them are very difficult to source in Atlantis."

"But Mr. Arbot has connections," we prompt.

She doesn't disagree, but doesn't elaborate, either.

>ask about brock
"There's a chance my friend was in trouble. Did he seem to be in a hurry or concerned about anything?"

"Not at all. He appeared eager to speak with Mr. Arbot, and they had plans together, but he didn't seem agitated. If anything, he seemed a little more worldly and collected than people in his line of work usually are."

Cryptic. Perhaps he was posing as a researcher? But we can't very well ask, not if we're supposed to be a friend of his.

Kate waves at someone she knows through the store window.

"If your friend is missing, you could report him to the Bureau, you know," she says. "I believe they keep close tabs on academic and research visitors. They may well know where he is."

"Thank you," you say. "I don't think things are quite at that point." And they never will be, obviously.

>gonear Antechamber
Antechamber
The most important task of any government bureau is to keep away time-wasters, irritants, and uninformed members of the general public, who might distract the diligent workers within from their important tasks. The Bureau of Orthography is no different.

An instructive notice details the criteria for entry to the Bureau proper.

Here to guard access to the rest of the building is a secretary on a tall stool. The secretary is carrying the Regulation Authentication Scope and wearing a pencil skirt and a plain white top.

We can go north and east from here.

She turns her eyes towards us but doesn't say anything.

We could ask whether she enjoys her job.

>talk to secretary
We already have the attention of the secretary.

I'd like to ask whether she enjoys her job.

>ask secretary about job
"This must be a good job," we say, in our best making-friendly-conversation way. "Getting to meet lots of new people. Access to all the bureau toys."

"They never let me try any of the good equipment," she says, with surprising bitterness. "When they brought in the T-inserter, they let Porson—" Then she stops, her expression that of a guppy being strangled.

I'd like to ask how she got this job, ask who Porson is, ask what the T-inserter does, or ask where the T-inserter is kept.

>g
"How did you get this job?" we ask.

"Through the usual process," she says. "I qualified through the regional spelling bee, then was submitted to a battery of examinations, followed by a three-year course of rigorous training."

We could ask who Porson is, ask what the T-inserter does, or ask where the T-inserter is kept.

>a porson
"Who is Porson?" we ask curiously.

"Porson works in the Historical Research Room," she says. "A job he got, I might add, through sheer nepotism. He's no more qualified than I am, but they say he has a 'job-related need' to see all the new developments first."

We could ask what the T-inserter does or ask where the T-inserter is kept.

>a t-inserter does
"What does the T-inserter do?" we ask, as though we were a couple of yokels.

She raises her eyebrows as though she cannot believe the phenomenal idiocy of this question. No answer is vouchsafed.

>a t-inserter
"This T-inserter must be pretty delicate," we say. I'm letting you talk, this time. I think I'm too direct. "I'm surprised the Bureau keeps it in a public building."

She visibly struggles between two impulses: the feeling that she shouldn't be talking about such a secret piece of equipment at all, and the desire to convince us that it couldn't be easily found or stolen. Finally she compromises with "Not all parts of the Bureau are equally available to visitors."

#backpacking
>gonear Dormitory Room
Dormitory Room
Painted off-white, with hard wood floors under many layers of protective gloss coating: there are no surfaces in this room that would take a stain. Four dorm beds are lined up against the wall.

The locker you identify as your own sits near one of the beds, still locked with its dial lock.

A girl of about 19 is standing in the middle of the room, looking around as though she can't quite believe where she landed or what she's doing here. She is carrying a heavy pack and wearing a pink t-shirt.

>purloin arm
Which do you mean, the 1) huge metal arm, the 2) arm, or the 3) sword arm?

>2
[Purloined.]

>z
With a grunt, she shrugs off her pack and puts it on the ground near one of the beds.

We could ask for privacy.

>z
She eyes the beds thoughtfully, punches each of the mattresses in turn, and then climbs into the one she's selected.

We could ask for privacy.

>z
She scrubs at her eyes with one hand.

"Do you like this place so far?"

I'd like to approve of Atlantis or ask for privacy.

>z
She watches us with interest.

We could approve of Atlantis or ask for privacy.

>z
She turns over.

"So when did you get to Anglophone Atlantis, anyway? How long have you been here?"

I'd like to lie about visiting or ask for privacy.

>show arm to girl
"What do you make of this?" we ask, showing off the arm.

The backpacking girl gags. After a moment to regain her composure, she flees the vicinity.

#shop-volunteer
>gonear New Church
Which do you mean, 1) what is worth seeing in the New Church, the 2) New Church, or the 3) New Church?

>3
New Church
Not a Gothic cathedral from the era when the church was wealthy and secure, but a gallant Neo-classical response to the turmoil of the 18th century, when the power of language was just beginning to be evident, and instead of an immutable cosmology, we suddenly had observer-consensus reality. What is the need or use of God, if it turns out that He gave all the power of creation to Adam when He let him name the animals?

An inscription above the altar, picked out in gold paint, reads Ἐν ἀρχῇ ἦν ὁ λόγος.

My mother volunteers here: I think I should warn you. She is not quite religious, but believes in the cultural value of the building, and in having some sort of place where people can go for spiritual respite. She also, I suspect, likes having those great gold letters, defiantly foreign and arcane in the heart of the old city.

There are side exits both east and west; and a gift shop occupies the narthex at the south end.

>s

Cathedral Gift Shop
This area used to be a sort of antechamber where the priests and choir might gather for processions into the church, but it has now been done over for retail purposes. This is one of several schemes to make the New Church pay for its own upkeep: a problem is that people somehow feel everything associated with a church ought to be free, including lunchtime concerts, potluck suppers, and Thursday-night lecture series.

The elderly man in charge of the gift shop nods at us as we come in.

A long line of dusty tomes are lined up on one of the shelves, marked "free for taking". None are missing.

We could ask what is worth seeing in the New Church.

>a worth seeing
"So tell me, what should I be looking for in the New Church?" we ask.

"Other than God?" he asks dryly.

Hm — the volunteers aren't very well trained, are they? I was expecting something about the points of architectural interest.

>a god
"Are you a believer?" we ask.

"Some of the time. The rest of the time I just wish I were." He flattens his hands on the surface of the counter. They are veiny, with coarse thick nails. Some reflection about the end of life, or the perspective of old age, seems inevitable. But he says: "You choose to believe or not. There's no such thing as absolute proof. So then the question is, do you want to believe in God? And, if so, what kind of God do you want to believe in? You go from there."

We could ask what sort of God he believes in or ask why he is here.

>g
"What sort of God do you believe in, then?" we ask. This isn't exactly how I expected this conversation to go, but no doubt you have some reason of your own for chatting with random strangers about their deeply held beliefs while we are supposed to be fleeing the country.

"Today?" He shrugs his cardigan-clad shoulders. "I figure he's a good enough type but he's a little tired of humans. Who wouldn't be? It might be that he's working on a new project and he's gotten distracted from us."

We want to ask what new project that might be.

>ask why he is here
"If you aren't interested in this place, why do you volunteer here?" we ask.

His left eyelid twitches. "The Rosehip woman," he says, after a moment. "She's a looker."

I'm not sure what's more disturbing: someone expressing attraction to my mother; that person being a good thirty years her senior; or the use of the phrase "she's a looker", which even this old character probably got from a movie.

We could remind the gift shop volunteer that Mrs. Rosehip is married.

>a rosehip
"My mother—" we begin, before you catch me.

Sorry about that!

"— always tells me it is unwise to chase after married women," we finish lamely.

He shakes with laughter. "Bless you," he says. "I'm not chasing after anyone! At my age, you just like a bit of good scenery. You're not hard on the eyes yourself, you know."

He looks at us thoughtfully and I almost have the feeling he knows something I don't want him to know. "You should keep moving. Don't waste time," he says.

>z
Time passes.

>wave m-remover at tomes
We smoothly, and almost without thinking about it, reset your device to be an M-remover. We wave the M-remover at the tomes and produce some toes, severed (because after all it would be beyond the parameters of the change to generate the person whose body part it is). They are only moderately gory, and most locals get used to seeing this kind of thing as a prank from six-year-olds every halloween. Still, they might startle a tourist.

"You broke it, you buy it," says the volunteer. "Though the tomes were free. But please at least take your mess away with you when you leave."

>wave b-remover at garbage
We smoothly, and almost without thinking about it, reset your device to be a B-remover. There is a smell of anise, and the garbage turns into a garage. It is a small but well-furnished garage for minor tuneups and repairs. It even comes with a mechanic: a surprising touch, since letter-removers are usually legally prevented from creating living persons, but sometimes there are glitches if the people are not created directly. Alas, however, it doesn't come with a car in residence.

The mechanic nods at us.

>ask mechanic to fix car

>show fuel to mechanic
I don't know what you think you're talking about, because we can't see any such thing here.

>ask mechanic about fuel

He chews on his tongue a couple of times and then notes that he heard fuel was usually found by digging in the ground.

>get out
Any particular direction? To the west, the street turns into a monumental staircase leading to the old fortified area — your hostel should be up that way — while a cross street heads southeast towards the main roundabout.

>wave h-remover at chard
We run our thumb over the dial, setting the device to an H-remover. With a distinct whiff of crisp, snappy cardboard, the chard turns into a card. Not a playing card, as I might have expected, or a calling card, or even an index card, but a Tarot card, representing the Chariot. The vehicle is drawn by two prize horses, one black, one white. The driver appears to be having some difficulty keeping them together, to judge from the surly expression and the raised whip.

>wave d-remover at card
We reset the device to d. With a distinct whiff of metal parts and oil, the card turns into a car. It is little larger than a toy, but that is what you want when driving on the streets around here. Any substantial vehicle wouldn't fit down the winding drives.

Here is how my mother gets around. She takes a 300 Euro Hermès scarf with an orange border and a pattern of prancing horses. She tosses it in the air. As it falls, she shoots it twice, like a clay pigeon: once to take out the F, the second time for the S. And such a car: buttery leather seats, jaguar lines. If someone asks how she gets such good results, she jokes that it's because of her quality materials.

Suffice it to say that we are not similarly blessed.

The car is far too large for us to carry, and falls onto the ground.

>ask mechanic to fix car

The extremely primitive dial in front of us is pointing all the way to the left. I think that's its way of saying it's out of fuel. At any rate, the engine won't start.

"Will this work?" We hold out the oil.

"Should do," he says. Rolling up his sleeves, he goes to work on the car. There is no small amount of banging and muttering, but finally he stands back and announces that he believes it is now in working condition.

I'd like to thank the mechanic.

[Your score has gone up by three points and is now eight.]

We switch on the ignition and the car comes to life. Smelly, trembling, putt-putting life, but still, not bad for something we conjured out of a vegetable picked outside my parents' place.

The car is making an unpleasant raspy growl.

>gonear University Oval
University Oval
This is the center of the university, a broad grassy oval shaded with sycamore trees and surrounded by buildings in brick or white stone.

An activist is standing in our way, gripping a sign that says "TOXI WASTE AWARENESS!".

Immediately south of here is the building where I spend most of my time, Samuel Johnson Hall.

"Do you have a minute to help save the environment?" the activist asks brightly.

I'd like to say no or say yes.

>yes
"Sure: why not?" we say.

"Wonderful!" she beams.

She sets down the sign in order to free her hands for more expressive argument. "Listen, we're trying to gain financial support to make a major advertising campaign pushing the concept of toxi waste throughout the anglophone world. If you know anything about linguistic efficacy, I'm sure you can imagine the implications."

I can, in fact, imagine the implications, probably a little better than she would like.

We want to encourage the activist to elaborate on the implications.

>encourage
"Oh?" we say neutrally. This is all it takes.

"Toxi waste would be, in concept, a completely harmless, safe, and neutral substance that would have no detrimental impact on the surrounding environment. By raising awareness of toxi waste throughout the Anglophone world, we would put the collective consciousness to work for the environment! It would then be possible for volunteer workers to convert large stocks of dangerous toxic waste into the safe, neutral toxi waste using minimal energy."

We want to ask how consciousness will be raised or ask how the campaign will address problems of visualization.

>ask how consciousness
"And, er, how do you plan to raise awareness of toxi waste to sufficient levels to achieve linguistic efficacy?" we ask. Well, that was mostly me. But I'm curious.

"That's where people like you come in," she admits, with a sweet little smile.

She watches us with interest. "The next few months are critical to our operation," the activist says. "We need to be able to blitz multiple countries simultaneously with an intense and outrageous advertising campaign that will garner further media coverage from news sources and provoke discussion on the internet and in the workplace. But in order to do that, we need the funding to place high profile advertisements in a variety of places. That's why donations from people like yourself are going to be so very necessary."

We could donate.

>a campaign
"Studies have shown that linguistic efficacy is drastically harder to achieve when the body of speakers does not have a consensus about how to visualize the object in question," we point out, settling into our element. I've had so many undergraduates with ideas just like this one, all eager to tell me how they're going to change the world. I suppose I have exactly the same problem, only on a grander scale.

My comment seems to have gotten her a little lost, though, so I add, "People need to have some image to attach to the term you're inventing for them. Otherwise, it will be much harder to achieve functional awareness levels."

"Oh! Yes, I left that part out," she says. "Our ad campaign will include extensive imagery of what we envision toxi waste to look like — that is, a clear, odorless liquid."

We could ask whether this liquid will be water, ask whether this liquid will also be flavorless, or donate.

>donate
Oh, you're not seriously going to — oh, god, you are. You know, this is never going to work. There are sound scientific reasons why — oh FINE.

We hand over some of your money — I guess I should console myself that it is yours — to the girl.

"Thanks!" she says brightly. Tucking the bill into her pocket, she gives a little skip and heads off across the oval to accost some other innocent.

You just enriched some random television network, you understand. That money won't do a lick of good to anyone else.

We put on our most attentive expression.

"Toxi waste would be, in concept, a completely harmless, safe, and neutral substance that would have no detrimental impact on the surrounding environment.

"We need to be able to blitz multiple countries simultaneously with an intense and outrageous advertising campaign that will garner further media coverage from news sources and provoke discussion on the internet and in the workplace.

"Studies have shown that linguistic efficacy is drastically harder to achieve when the body of speakers does not have a consensus about how to visualize the object in question," we point out, settling into our element.

>a flavorless
"Will it be flavorless, too?" you ask. I didn't come up with this one.

"Huh?"

"I think," you go on maliciously, "that toxi waste should have a catchy flavor. Maybe spearmint."

The furrow between her brows deepens as she tries to work out whether we are joking and, if so, what response would be appropriate. Finally she settles for, "The ads are going to be on TV, so it's hard to show any flavors on television."

I'd like to ask whether this liquid will be water.

>a water
"Is the role of toxi waste by any chance going to be played by, say, filtered water?" we ask.

Her eyebrows crinkle together. "Yes — well, maybe," she says. "Why?"

/(I'm inclined|We want) to warn the activist about term-reassignment.

>warn
"Because," we say, "if you show people pictures of what is obviously water, they will continue thinking of it as water — not as toxi waste, or whatever you want them to call it. Studies have shown that people's word concepts are very persistent in that way — and anyway there are a variety of reasons why even if you could do it, it would be very bad to overwrite the linguistic efficacy of 'water'."

She purses her lips. "You're in Language Studies, aren't you?" she asks. "I was warned about people from your department. You can be very negative."

/(My response would be|I'd like) to point out that being from Language Studies does not make us wrong.

>point out
"Negative or not, it is true," we say. "If you try to teach people a new word for an existing substance, you have to fight with their preconceptions about how to categorize that substance. If, on the other hand, you try to make them think of a new and as-yet-non-existent substance, you have less control over what happens when it reifies — the result might not be quite what you wanted."

"All right," she says belligerently. "How would you do it?"

At this precise moment I feel myself fall for this girl. She's still naive and earnest and probably too young for me, but there is something about the determination and assertion and the spirit of I-dare-you-to-think-of-one-better that makes me want to drag her off to a coffee shop and enlighten her for four or five hours.

But I bet you wouldn't like to play gooseberry to that expedition.

/(We want|I'm inclined) to explain about our plans.

>explain
"To do this really right," I say, under our breath so that no one will overhear us, "you have to think even bigger than you have been. Forget English. Forget Mandarin Chinese. Forget Spanish, Hindi, Russian, Arabic. You have to make a new language to resolve these difficulties, and you have to teach it on an epic scale."

She has been leaning in, breathlessly, to listen to this explanation, but now she backs up and looks at us like we've sprouted a second head, which, all things considered, would not be all that unnatural.

"That would take forever!" she exclaims. (I had calculated maybe fifty or a hundred years to the first significant successes, but I suppose that is not unlike forever if you're sufficiently short-sighted.) "And you'd need a huge amount of money!"

I sigh. "All the same," we say, a little sadly. "It would work better than what you're proposing here. I'm sorry. I wish I thought it would work."

>smile
We smile, a little bit apologetically.

She doesn't smile back. "I'd better go," she says. "There are other people, I should try to — I've got a quota."

She turns and heads across the quad, head down. Halfway there she stops and looks back at us, then walks on, more quickly.

Sigil Street
The buildings here are two and three stories, with shops at ground level and elderly apartments above. The shops are closed for the holiday: a typographer's office, tourist boutiques of colorful skirts and ethnic bodices (rarely if ever worn by natives) and t-shirts covered with font designs.

Passing by the reflective window we catch the sight of our single blended body, and it creeps me out.

A narrow alley runs between buildings to the south, while the street continues east.

>wave u-remover at dress

Someone has left a shopping bag at the roadside — maybe by accident when loading up a car, maybe because they mean to come back for it. In the shopping bag are a ball and a jigsaw.

We are jammed into the car with our knees almost at our chin, looking out through the bulbous little windshield. The motor is growling like a housecat with pneumonia.

There is a large collection of vintage and antique maps under glass — the island of Atlantis as a whole, street maps of here and of Maiana, navigation maps of the harbor, and then maps of more distant places as well.

A stylish mannequin near the front sports a pair of Britishizing goggles.

Overseeing all this is a woman named Kate.

"Welcome to Arbot," says Kate. "Feel free to browse and ask me any questions you may have about the merchandise."

We could ask whether she has seen Brock.

>gonear odor
Wonderland
The ridiculous décor continues, now so extreme that I cannot even put a name to the things around us. They might as well be extrusions from a nightmare by Dali, or by Dr. Seuss. Offices are accessed by hatchways that seem to have come from submarines, or through passages resembling the sphincter of a great whale, or up ladders decorated with human teeth.

An open archway leads to storage space east of here.

Hanging in the air at the north end of the hallway is an odor.

There are a paperweight and an inciting fable on the long table.

We can go south to Wonderland and east from here.

>L U-REMOVER
It is a blunt-nosed plastic device, about the size of a laser pointer, that can be waved at things to remove excess Us. It is not very powerful, and often fails against large items. On the other hand, it has a wide range of action: it can be set to any letter we choose.

I take it this is where you stayed from the time you got to town until our operation. I would have expected that someone with your credentials would have been able to afford something better: The Fleur d'Or, maybe? But maybe you thought this was lower-profile. At least it's clean and doesn't smell funny.

The desk attendant is sort of eying us. She doesn't recognize you — us — but that's a good thing, I think.

Discarded in one corner is Guidebook to Anglophone Atlantis.

There's a spiral staircase that leads up to the dormitory rooms.

>autoupgrade
>wave b-remover at blouse
We run our thumb over the dial, setting the device to a B-remover. With a distinct whiff of summer heat, the blouse turns into a louse. Ick.

The attendant screams, and performs some kind of strange dance, first brushing at her skin and then stomping at something on the floor. (So much for the louse, I think.)

She then tears out of the room, leaving it unattended. Unfortunately, places like this don't keep anything of value out front anyway, so your natural gift for larceny hasn't much scope here.

It looks like a setting of "The Grammatical Number of Our Enemy (Is Singular)," a popular music-hall piece of the 1890s that still gets trotted out now and then. There are rousing choruses where the audience can join in to represent the enemy sailors just prior to their encounter with the depluralizing cannon.

>gonear drinks club
Fleur d'Or Drinks Club
The back wall is dramatically decorated with bottled liquors of all sorts, from gin to cachaça; there's a giant bottle of Campari, taller than your average three-year-old, with a red ribbon around its neck.

What makes this place technically a drinks club rather than a bar is its license to serve letter-manufactured food and drink. A toolkit on the bar contains some screwdrivers, some gimlets, and some rusty nails, ready to be transformed into their respective cocktails.

The bartender is in the middle of showing her homonym paddle to a patron holding a gin and tonic. The other patrons are scattered around the room at small tables, drinking or talking among themselves.

She acknowledges us with a nod as we stroll up to the bar and get close enough to hear their conversation. "It was originally produced as a toy, but it's actually a bit dangerous," the bartender is saying.

"Dangerous? How so?" asks the patron.

"Various ways," she says. "Suppose I hit a small object that has a big homonym, like say a plane. You know, the carpentry kind. Suddenly I've got an airplane-style plane on top of me."

>bartender, paddle sign
"What do you make of this?" we ask, showing off the sign.

"I don't think that would turn into anything," says the bartender. She taps it with the paddle to demonstrate. "See? No change."

"What if you hit something that doesn't mean anything else?" the patron asks. "Like a chicken?"

"Nothing," she says. "That's safe." As though to demonstrate, she smacks the paddle against her left buttock. "See? I don't get changed into a different bartender. Want to try?"

She holds up the paddle as though she's going to tap him with it.

"Uh... my name is Mark," he says.

"Maybe not, then!" she says, laughing brightly.

>bartender, paddle piece
"Check this out," we say, holding out the piece for inspection.

"Er… I think that would make a handgun, which would be illegal around here," she says.

"That was a little dangerous, wasn't it?" Mark asks. "If you had tapped me with that thing, wouldn't I be a giant X on the carpet now?"

"Not for long," the bartender says. "I do have some restoration gel for emergencies. Or I could just hit you again with the paddle. But there would be an incident report and I could lose my license. So, yeah, better not."

>purloin roll

>1
[Purloined.]

>ask bartender for screwdriver
We order a screwdriver.

The bartender fishes around in the toolkit for a screwdriver and sets it on the bar with a flourish. Mark is watching this transaction in an interested way.

"This is good," says the bartender, winking at us both (all?). "You'll like this." She raises the homonym paddle unnecessarily high in the air and smashes it down hard on the screwdriver.

There's a crackling discharge of purple-toned lightning, and in place of the screwdriver, a cocktail of the same name now sits on the bar. A few of the customers applaud.

"Just the way you were imagining it, guaranteed."

I'd like to thank the bartender.

[Your score has gone up by one point and is now three.]

>gel screwdriver
We turn away from the bartender so she won't see too obviously what we're up to. I suppose it doesn't matter, but I wouldn't want her feelings to be hurt. We just touch a coated fingertip of gel to the Screwdriver. With an audible SPLORT, the Screwdriver becomes a screwdriver. The screwdriver is flat-headed, with a red plastic handle and a sturdy shaft.

I'm starting to understand how you got into all the places you got into. Not that I judge you or your line of work, of course.

Mark looks thoughtfully into his gin and tonic. "I hear that sometimes the Bureau turns people into inanimate objects as a criminal sentence. Is that true?"

For the first time, the bartender looks uncomfortable. "I just pour the drinks," she says. "Hey, you're almost out there! Let me give you a refill." And she busies herself getting down the Bombay Sapphire and refilling his drink.

"You ever tempted to paddle the Sapphire?" Mark asks. "Should be worth a lot."

"Alas, jewelers tend to check for authenticity around here," she replies.

I'd like to thank the bartender.

[Your score has gone up by one point and is now four.]

>show screwdriver to bartender
(the screwdriver to the bartender)
We ask for another Screwdriver, but the bartender says she's limited to one drink per type per club member. "They're a loss leader," she explains. "Tools are more expensive than cocktails, and then even with the rusty nails, there's the energy to run the paddle."

A businesswoman comes up to the bar for directions to the nearest restroom.

We could thank the bartender.

Which do you mean, 1) Aquarium Bookstore or the 2) Aquarium Bookstore?

Aquarium Bookstore
The shop takes its name from the collection of fish mounted on every wall: swordfish, bass, other things I don't recognize. Underneath these dubious tokens, the walls are covered with bookshelves, and there are stacks of books on the floor where the shelves have proven insufficient.

The merchandise consists mainly, but not exclusively, of books, and the selection caters to odd tastes. You once picked up in here a book about a man who R-removed a wrench, and then had his way with it. You and Brock had a good time with that one for the next month and a half.

Lena is present, all right. In fact she watches us keenly the instant we come into the shop. Lena is an associate of Slango's. You hadn't realized that had crossed over into a romance. Slango has never, ever in your recollection dated anyone. And now this.

"Happy Serial Comma Day," she says.

My response would be to ask whether she has seen Slango or say who we are.

>purloin Origin Paste.
[Purloined.]

>z
Time passes.

"Glad to see you've got plenty of Origin Paste," Lena remarks. "It's such a useful thing to have. Smells so nice."

We could ask whether she has seen Slango or say who we are.

>open tub
That's already open.

We want to ask whether she has seen Slango or say who we are.

>ask about slango
"You wouldn't happen to have seen Slango about recently?" we ask.

"Slango?" she asks blankly, for all the world as though she'd had a lobotomy. "Is that a board game?"

We could say who we are.

>say who we are
"Lena, it's Andra. And company. Maybe Slango mentioned that I was auditioning a new silent partner."

"I don't know what you're talking about," she says. "But since you're here, whoever you are, I wonder whether you'd like to have a look at some merchandise of mine that could use a spruce."

Aha. She wants us to prove our identity; probably has contraband that needs concealing, and wants us to do the deed as proof of trustworthiness.

There's a brief pause. Lena goes off into a corner and rummages among the suspicious piles of books, and uncovers a box. "C'mere," she says; and obediently I wander over to that area of the store, which incidentally happens to be tucked away and half-hidden by shelves.

"See here," she says. "See what you can do with it, eh?"

>z
Time passes.

"Try doing something with the modems," Lena suggests.

>z
Time passes.

Lena awaits your attention to the modems.

>wave m-remover at modems
We reset the device to m. With a distinct whiff of old book, the modems turn into some odes. A slender volume of poetry, bound between red covers. It looks completely harmless and is written in English.

The blurb on the back describes it as a "collection of meditations" on Atlantis' imaginary roots, which is to say, a lot of stuff about magic-wielding Phoenicians, Knights Templar, refugees from the Tower of Babel, space aliens, cabalistic mysticism, and Lully's combinatorics.

It fits in perfectly with the rest of Lena's selection. Really amazing work. I've seen other people who were able to do impressive things with local field distortions — think hard enough and you can prejudice the outcome of a linguistic transition.

But this... this is detail work like I haven't seen. My hat is off.

Or would be if I were wearing a hat and taking it off didn't mean making you take it off too.

Lena touches the binding appreciatively. "You've even got that little bit of creasing in the spine that makes it look used," she says. "This is perfect. Only risk is customers wanting to buy it. I've got a couple this would be right up their alley."

>wave s-remover at odes
We reset the device to s. With a distinct whiff of paper, the odes turn into an ode. A short poem, letter-pressed attractively on a sheet of thick paper. It is entitled "Our Ancestors, The Immortal Spirits of the Pyramids," a fact which disinclines me to study the rest.

"Well, it's portable, and it doesn't look like much, but then again, it doesn't look like much. I mean, I could easily lose it, couldn't I? Just one sheet. And if someone were to ask me why I was carrying it around that would be a little hard to explain. It's not like it's a whole book of 'em, is it?"

We could calm Lena.

>gel ode
We dip out a pea-sized quantity of gel and rub it gently onto the ode. With an audible SPLORT, the ode becomes some modems.

"I'm looking forward to what you do with the preamps," Lena says. "They should look... innocent."

>wave m-remover at modems
We reset the device to m. The modems give way to the now-familiar odes.

"Nice monocle, by the way! You do have all the good toys. Suppose it means you can check your work and see whether you've really got enough paste on things."

>wave p-remover at preamps
We reset the device to p. There is a peach cloud, and the preamps turn into some reams. Since each ream is 500 sheets of paper, and there are many reams here, the collection is unhelpfully bulky.

Lena considers the heap of reams contemplatively. "That's inconvenient, isn't it," she says. "And I have a book store, not an office supply shop."

My response would be to calm Lena or tease Lena about selling office supplies.

>wave s-remover at reams
We reset the device to s. There is a mad-scientist cackle, and the reams turn into a ream. One ream, which is to say 500 sheets, of generic printer or copier paper, in white-white.

"That works. Kind of thing I might have around for printing invoices on. I was a little afraid there you were going to go for a ram just to spite me. Don't know where I'd put one of those around here."

>put paste on odes
We smear some of the Origin Paste onto the odes. Nothing obvious happens, of course, but that is the whole point.

"Excellent," Lena mutters under her breath.

>put paste on ream
We smear some of the Origin Paste onto the ream. Nothing obvious happens, of course, but that is the whole point.

"Perfect," Lena says, regarding her contraband possessions with satisfaction. "Welcome back, Andra and Guest."

I'm inclined to ask whether she has seen Slango.

>ask whether
"Now, you owe me one Slango," you say. "Where'd he get to?"

"Slango and I were catching up. Bless that man, he's hung like a yak," she says. "But he got bad news and had to hurry back to the yacht. Said something about not being able to keep an appointment. I take it you're the appointment? I can try reaching him for you, if you want."

I'd like to encourage Lena to contact Slango.

>encourage
"That would be extremely helpful," we say. Perhaps we can finally get off this island and back into our separate skins, which would not be one minute too soon for me.

"Very good," she says. She goes over to one of the free-standing shelves and takes out copies of Pat and Chris and the Homonym Paddle and Seventy Ways to Disable an Authentication Scope. Behind these works of literature she finds what looks like a cellular phone; but it mustn't be one, or at least not of the usual variety, because the Bureau tightly controls such items.

We hear half a conversation. "It's me. There's someone to see... yes, I had her do the contraband... I don't know, a little taller and a lot less mean... Oh! I see. She looks healthy enough... I'm not running a restaurant! Okay. Okay. I'll talk to you later, sweetie. Bye."

Without meeting our eye, she buries the phone back in its previous location. Then she says, "He's coming in direct. He says go over to Counterfeit Monkey and he'll be right over as originally planned, and he's sorry about the wait."

"Oh! And." She tosses us a coin. "Have a drink on me."

I'd like to thank Lena.

[Your score has gone up by three points and is now seven.]

"This would be a good time to stop for lunch and a little siesta," says Lena, following us to the door. As we go out, she's rolling down the shades and putting up a closed sign.

Our pathetic little car is parked right outside Aquarium Bookstore. Here is how my mother gets around. She takes a 300 Euro Hermès scarf with an orange border and a pattern of prancing horses. She tosses it in the air. As it falls, she shoots it twice, like a clay pigeon: once to take out the F, the second time for the S. And such a car: buttery leather seats, jaguar lines. If someone asks how she gets such good results, she jokes that it's because of her quality materials.

Sensitive Equipment Testing Room
A room with no windows, no cameras, no recording equipment, and barely any furniture.

A rock sits in one corner of the room.

At the center of the room is a gleaming new T-inserter Machine. This is a state of the art device: letter removal has been well understood for decades, but insertion is much more dangerous and difficult, fraught with ambiguity.

>i
We are equipped with the following essentials: a backpack, your C-remover (upgraded to handle animates and abstracts), a flash drive, a monocle, some Origin Paste, a roll, and a tub of restoration gel.

We are also carrying an anagramming gun, an as, a piece, a sign, and a tap.

The flash drive and the monocle are in the backpack, which is gaping wide open so everyone can see what's inside.

Brock stands, dusting himself off. He looks us up and down without expression, without any sign of recognition. "What day is it?" he asks.

"Still Serial Comma Day," you say. "Brock, it's me. And Alex, but I'm here."

The waxen look melts and he grins. "Thank god. It's harder than you'd expect being a rock."

Hustle, bustle, dirt; ugly American chain shops; lots and lots of people. There seems to be a large organized protest in progress: protesters completely cram the sidewalk to the southeast.

The curb is lined with garbage.

To the west, the street turns into a monumental staircase leading to the old fortified area — your hostel should be up that way — while a cross street heads southeast towards the main roundabout.

From a loudspeaker nearby comes the electronic sound of simulated bells ringing the hour after noon. It's later than I thought. We'd better get a move on.

>purloin chard

>wave d-remover at chard
We smoothly, and almost without thinking about it, reset your device to be a D-remover. With a distinct whiff of faint fishiness, the chard turns into a char. It's a troutlike freshwater fish of the northern countries. It is dead, needless to say, and would make someone a nice supper if they knew how to clean and cook it. Our skills, however, are not up to the task.

>wave h-remover at char
We run our thumb over the dial, setting the device to an H-remover. With a distinct whiff of metal parts and oil, the char turns into a car. It is little larger than a toy, but that is what you want when driving on the streets around here. Any substantial vehicle wouldn't fit down the winding drives.

Here is how my mother gets around. She takes a 300 Euro Hermès scarf with an orange border and a pattern of prancing horses. She tosses it in the air. As it falls, she shoots it twice, like a clay pigeon: once to take out the F, the second time for the S. And such a car: buttery leather seats, jaguar lines.

Not a playing card, as I might have expected, or a calling card, or even an index card, but a Tarot card, representing the Chariot. The vehicle is drawn by two prize horses, one black, one white. The driver appears to be having some difficulty keeping them together, to judge from the surly expression and the raised whip.

The problem is that it takes us along with it.

I've always wondered what this last passage to non-existence might be like. It turns out that there is a rushing noise, and a tunnel we travel very rapidly towards darkness; and all around us are other objects also in the middle of ceasing to be.

Dormitory Room
Painted off-white, with hard wood floors under many layers of protective gloss coating: there are no surfaces in this room that would take a stain. Four dorm beds are lined up against the wall.

The locker you identify as your own sits near one of the beds, still locked with its dial lock.

A girl of about 19 is standing in the middle of the room, looking around as though she can't quite believe where she landed or what she's doing here. She is carrying a heavy pack and wearing a pink t-shirt.

"Hey," says the girl. "Do you think this place is safe?" she asks conspiratorially.

I must look blank, because she goes on, "I saw this documentary once, right, about a serial killer who went from youth hostel to youth hostel, grooming girls and killing them. And then he'd chop up the bodies and put the body parts into the lockers. And no one would find out until he'd gone away again."

Nothing like that has happened around here, but she seems to get a charge out of scaring herself with this story.

>a slango
"I wonder whether you've seen an associate of mine," we say to Parker. "Name of Slango."

Parker looks over the bar at us. "He comes in here from time to time," he says. "Very regular customer. Always has about three rum and cokes."

This is a lie, and therefore a test. Slango doesn't drink alcohol himself and doesn't permit drunkenness in his crew.

We could challenge Parker about the rum.

>a rum
"Must be a different Slango," we say. "Mine is more of a root beer man. Thanks anyway though."

"Oh, that Slango," Parker says, thoughtfully moving the Origin Paste sitting on the bar. "He's been around town the last couple of days, but not today. If you know his lady friend, you might try her."

Lady friend? This can only mean Lena, she being the only female native with whom Slango spends much time socially. But you wouldn't have guessed that she'd advanced to the status of lady friend. Either way, Lena is a rather odd woman who keeps a used bookstore off Deep Street.

We could ask whether we can have the Origin Paste.

>look
Counterfeit Monkey
Infamously this pub was raided in 1929, the year that the Bureau developed its first meager attempt at an Authentication Scope, and dozens of smugglers and fraudulent businessmen went to jail. But neither that raid nor subsequent scrutiny has ever shut the place down entirely. Built when people were a bit shorter and ceilings were a bit lower, the Counterfeit Monkey is always smoky and never well lit, even in the middle of the day.

The clientele are currently engaged in a game of darts, while the barman watches and practices a sarcastic wit on those who embarrass themselves. There is also a quantity of Origin Paste sitting out on the bar.

>a paste

"Well now," he says, grinning, "that would surely be illegal, would it not?

On the other hand there is no law against someone winning the Origin Paste in a completely legitimate game of chance or skill."

I'd like to ask how one might go about winning.

"Explain this game as though I have no idea what you're talking about," you say, leaning on the bar in an interested fashion. Are you flirting with Parker? No? Okay. Good to know.

"It's a designated challenge game," says Parker. You've seen this played before, but he explains the rules anyway.

"There are two contestants, one challenger and one defender.

"The challenger chooses any object he likes and shows it to the moderator ahead of time.

"The defender, without seeing the object, stipulates a general category. The challenger has five minutes to turn his designated object into an item that fits the defender's category, or he forfeits his ante."

I'd like to play the game.

You have a fleeting thought of past experience playing games.

"I'd like to play that," we say.

"Excellent. Oh, I did mention the small matter of the entry fee?"

I get out the roll of bills and he peels off two twenties.

"Thank you. Now, you pick your entry article, and I'll ask one of these good gentlemen to suggest a defense category."

"Slango," you say. "Lena gave me a totally unwanted visual about your yaklike proportions. Guess you also got a yak's sense of clock time?"

"It was an emergency. I figured you'd go to Lena, and I was right."

"You were lucky. I knew her a little, but I had no idea you two were making the yak with two humps."

"No such thing as a bactrian yak," Slango replies. "My apologies. I assumed that what Brock knows, he passes on to you, and he certainly knows about me and Lena." He scowls into his root beer. "Nearly gave himself a hernia laughing," Slango adds under his breath.

/(We could|I'd like to|We want to|I'm inclined to|My response would be to) explain Brock's probable reasons or ask whether we can leave now.

>laugh
"Heh." It's easy for you to picture — and thus for me to picture — the way Brock laughs: the startled loud crack of a laugh at the beginning, like a thunderclap, and then the rest of the laugh following after a pause. It's like for a moment he's too surprised by the awesomeness of the joke to keep going.

"She's old enough to be your spinster aunt and flaky enough to tell your fortune with half a tarot deck and a couple of Uno cards," you say. "We haven't got a lot of clues about what your type is, but I doubt Brock would have guessed Lena."

"She's thirty-two," says Slango crisply. "She runs Radio Free Atlantida single-handed with electronics she built herself. And if she were old enough to be my spinster aunt, that would still be my business."

"So, uh, I guess you guys are pretty serious, then," you say.

"I'd give her and me better odds than you and Brock."

/(We could|I'd like to|We want to|I'm inclined to|My response would be to) mutter darkly or ask whether we can leave now.

>snicker
I giggle sharply, a nervous little titter that makes Slango look at us distrustfully. This is not what we need now.

"I had a pick-up arranged to get him off the island shore all the way down by Maiana last night, but he didn't make it, and sent no messages. I checked a contact in Bureau Processing, but no arrest file has gone through, so Brock hasn't been caught. He's just... missing."

>gonear Sensitive Equipment Testing Room
Sensitive Equipment Testing Room
A room with no windows, no cameras, no recording equipment, and barely any furniture.

A rock sits in one corner of the room.

At the center of the room is a gleaming new T-inserter Machine. This is a state of the art device: letter removal has been well understood for decades, but insertion is much more dangerous and difficult, fraught with ambiguity.

>purloin tub
[Purloined.]

>autoupgrade
>unmonkey
>open tub
We open the tub, revealing some restoration gel.

>gel rock
We dip out a pea-sized quantity of gel and rub it gently onto the rock. With an audible SPLORT, the rock becomes Brock. He looks a bit haggard to me, but I don't think anything too horrible has happened to him. So perhaps you can stop worrying.

I'm starting to understand how you got into all the places you got into. Not that I judge you or your line of work, of course.

Brock stands, dusting himself off. He looks us up and down without expression, without any sign of recognition. "What day is it?" he asks.

"Still Serial Comma Day," you say. "Brock, it's me. And Alex, but I'm here."

The waxen look melts and he grins. "Thank god. It's harder than you'd expect being a rock."

I'd like to suggest we get out of here, complain about Brock's recklessness, or rejoice that Brock is okay. Then again, we could just get to work so we can be out of here faster.

[Your score has gone up by one point.]

>suggest we get out
"You've been a lump of igneous all day," you say. "It's getting dark out there. If we don't get out now, we're going to get caught by some janitor with a privative affixer."

"I didn't have time to run the tests I wanted to run on the T-inserter. It'll take three minutes and then we can go. We need to do abstracts, animates, and a stability check."

Brock roots around in his pockets and fishes out a sign. "I picked this up in the hallway, if it's any use," he says. He tosses it in the corner.

We want to insist on leaving immediately or accept Brock's lunacy. Maybe it's not worth it, though.

>insist
I say, "If we get caught down here, we'll all be put on trial, my father could lose his job, the professor who helped me get in here might face prosecution..."

"Not to mention the part," you cut in, "where we all get stuck on a shelf to eternally contemplate the spelling of 'knickknack'."

"Four consonants in a row, baby," he murmurs. "You know what makes me hot."

"Brock." The warning tone in your voice gets through to him, whereas apparently he has zero interest in the welfare of my entire social circle.

"Three minutes. The value of that data could be in the millions."

He knocks on the top of the T-inserter. "First we should see whether this thing can reify abstracts."

I'm inclined to complain about Brock's recklessness or discover why Brock got stuck here. Or, then again, there's always finishing the job.

>wave g-remover at sign
We smoothly, and almost without thinking about it, reset your device to be a G-remover. With a distinct whiff of sulfur, the sign turns into a sin. An abstract representation of pettiness of spirit and obsession with needless detail, embodied by the image of a grey-skinned bureaucrat and a huge heap of papers.

He runs his fingers over the surface of the machine, checking for hot spots. "If it can't do abstracts, the market value is going to be a lot lower because of the limited-depth trees."

We could complain about Brock's recklessness or discover why Brock got stuck here. Or, then again, there's always finishing the job.

[Your score has gone up by one point and is now two.]

>put sin in the t-inserter
(first taking the sin)
There are two small pops from the machine as it turns the sin into a stint.

The flickering images represent a period of time spent in the military: a young person in a uniform, smartly waving goodbye to hazily-sketched parents; a duration of training and mostly boring patrol work; release from service, with a few mild commendations and some pocket money.

"Right. It's good on abstracts, then," Brock says, contemplating the stint.

Brock is looking at everything but us. "I've half a mind to explore a little while we're down here just about unsupervised," Brock says reflectively.

I glare at him.

"I know there's no time," he says. "But there are supposed to be all sorts of things in the Bureau sub-basement that have never seen the light of day. DCL projects that went wrong, secret government experiments, possibly a buried command center."

I'd like to ask what buried command center he heard of. Or, then again, there's always finishing the job.

[Your score has gone up by one point and is now three.]

>ask about buried command
"Buried command center?" you ask. "Isn't there a pretty unsecret command center above-ground?"

"Sure. But you hear rumors that the instructions come up from the sub-basement. Their chief leader, maybe."

He stands back, regarding the T-inserter thoughtfully. "Next it would be good to see if this thing can build animates."

You are reminded of how it started with Brock.

[MEMORIES will list your currently active memories]
>gel stint
We dip out a pea-sized quantity of gel and rub it gently onto the stint. With an audible SPLORT, the stint becomes a sign.

He watches us with a slightly disturbing intentness in his eyes. I look away again.

>wave g-remover at sign
The sign gives way to the now-familiar sin.

>wave s-remover at sin
We run our thumb over the dial, setting the device to an S-remover. The device buzzes, puzzled. It is unable to create anything recognizable called "in".

>i
We are equipped with the following essentials: your S-remover (upgraded to handle animates and abstracts) and a tub of restoration gel.

>put sin in t-inserter
We momentarily lift the sin out of the T-inserter machine and then drop it back in.

There are two small pops from the machine as it turns the sin into a stint.

He knocks on the top of the T-inserter. "If it can't do animates, that might be down to a legal restriction, of course, rather than a technical one, but I imagine that they'd be demo'ing a fully-capable product in this context."

>wave s-remover at stint
There is a flash of red light, and the stint turns into a tint. A vivid shade of yellow, as though someone had watercolored that bit of air.

He's studiously looking around the room. This is like a very surreal blind date.

>wave n-remover at tint
We reset the device to n. With a distinct whiff of fresh air, the tint turns into a tit. A small, harmless-looking bird.

He eyes the tit. "Oh for a homonym paddle."

The tit clambers out of the T-inserter machine.

>wave t-remover at tit
We reset the device to t. There is a mad-scientist cackle, and the tit turns into an I. It's an abstract that looks like a bit of mirror. When I look at it I see Alex, my proper self, and not just restored to my usual body, but photo-retouched to be that bit smarter and freer of skin-blemishes, well-dressed. It's like looking in the mirror at reality as it should be.

You doubtless see yourself too — as you are, or perhaps as you want to be.

He cocks his head to look at the I. "I have surprisingly good hair for someone who has just been a rock."

"Objects in mirror may appear more attractive than they are," we remark.

>put i in t-inserter
(first taking the I)
There are two small pops from the machine as it turns the I into a tit.

Of course, there were other options there: the T-inserter could have made two words. But it seems to be disambiguating to the tit. The question now is whether it would do so consistently or whether its behavior is underdetermined; we don't have time for a really thorough trial set, but checking a couple more times may be indicative.

"No problem creating creatures," Brock says judiciously.

He runs his fingers over the surface of the machine, checking for hot spots. "As our next trick we need to look at the stabilization performance," Brock says. "Inserters sometimes run into trouble if there's a case where the same base word could be expanded to multiple derivatives — for instance, if you S-inserted CREAM, it wouldn't know whether to make CREAMS or SCREAM or SCREAMS."

The tit clambers out of the T-inserter machine.

>wave t-remover at tit
The tit gives way to the now-familiar I.

He stands back, regarding the T-inserter thoughtfully. "Some inserters," Brock goes on, "have controls to let you insert the minimum or maximum possible number of letters."

>put i in t-inserter
(first taking the I)
There is a loud and satisfying pop from the machine as it turns the I into an it. It's itself. It. The epitome of itness. Philosophers would pay millions.

There now: the T-inserter has constructed both tit and it. Not very stable, it seems. Slango will be interested to know that.

"Check," says Brock. "And that's all we need here. Now..." He hesitates. "One person escaping is easier than two, I suppose."

You start to object, but I say, "Yes, you'd better return to petrified form." You know I'm right. He'll be easier to carry.

A little grimly, he produces his own letter-remover and repeats the B-removal that made him in the first place. Once again we're alone in a room with a rock.

[Your score has gone up by three points and is now six.]

>get rock
We take the rock. Heavy, dark, and roughly hexagonal, like a slice of basalt column.

There is a loud and satisfying pop from the machine as it turns the seer automaton into a steer automaton.

Real leather covers a framework of wood and steel, making an alert and surprisingly lifelike model steer.

The steer automaton is currently switched off.

Of course, there were other options there: the T-inserter could have made two words. But it seems to be disambiguating to the steer automaton. The question now is whether it would do so consistently or whether its behavior is underdetermined; we don't have time for a really thorough trial set, but checking a couple more times may be indicative.

>gel automaton
We dip out a pea-sized quantity of gel and rub it gently onto the steer automaton. With an audible SPLORT, the steer automaton becomes a seer automaton. It's a robotic head inside a glass box. When turned on, it gives out fortunes. There's an old-fashioned carnival feel about the thing, and the fact that it's a portable size makes it a good candidate for traveling fairs.

"I didn't have time to run the tests I wanted to run on the T-inserter. It'll take three minutes and then we can go. We need to do abstracts, animates, and a stability check."

I'd like to insist on leaving immediately or accept Brock's lunacy. Or, then again, there's always finishing the job.

>put seer in t-inserter
We momentarily lift the seer automaton out of the T-inserter machine and then drop it back in.

There are two small pops from the machine as it turns the seer automaton into a setter automaton. It's a little like one of those Japanese robot dogs, only substantially more old-fashioned and artisanal. Its bright glass eyes watch us expectantly and its ruddy fur is thick and lustrous.

The setter automaton is currently switched off.

There now: the T-inserter has constructed both steer automaton and setter automaton. Not very stable, it seems. Slango will be interested to know that.

He's looking at us, but when I look back, he cuts his eyes away. "I've half a mind to explore a little while we're down here just about unsupervised," Brock says reflectively.

>turn on automaton
The setter automaton runs in a circle and barks several times, then sits expectantly and shuts off again.

"The fact that it made the steer automaton and the setter automaton means that the stabilization is inconsistent at best," Brock says. "And I don't see any min-max calibrator on the outside. Remind me to check the plans again when we get back to the yacht. They may not have tried to handle that problem at all."

He runs his fingers over the surface of the machine, checking for hot spots. "If it can't do abstracts, the market value is going to be a lot lower because of the limited-depth trees."

>put the roll in the t-inserter
"Here." Brock fishes the setter automaton out of the T-inserter. He tosses it in the corner.

There is a loud and satisfying pop from the machine as it turns the roll into a troll.

Grey skin, yellow teeth, green eyes. Legs as big around as tree trunks. A pot belly, speaking of a great deal of food eaten raw.

"No problem creating creatures," Brock says judiciously.

The troll gets out of the T-inserter machine.

>gel the troll
We dip out a pea-sized quantity of gel and rub it gently onto the troll. With an audible SPLORT, the troll becomes a roll.

He's studiously looking around the room. I look away again.

>wave d-remover at chard
We smoothly, and almost without thinking about it, reset your device to be a D-remover. With a distinct whiff of faint fishiness, the chard turns into a char. It's a troutlike freshwater fish of the northern countries. It is dead, needless to say, and would make someone a nice supper if they knew how to clean and cook it. Our skills, however, are not up to the task.

[Your score has gone up by one point and is now three.]

>put char in t-inserter
There is a loud and satisfying pop from the machine as it turns the char into a chart.

A beautiful nautical chart depicting the harbor of Anglophone Atlantis, safest approaches, etc.

He knocks on the top of the T-inserter. Brock goes on about the importance of abstracts.

>wave c-remover at chart
We run our thumb over the dial, setting the device to a C-remover. With a distinct whiff of sweaty animal, the chart turns into a hart. It's rather frightening, since it plainly isn't tame, but it doesn't seem to have any immediate intent to rush at us.

He pauses, listening for noises outside. Brock goes on about the importance of abstracts.

The hart clambers out of the T-inserter machine.

>wave r-remover at hart
We reset the device to r. With a distinct whiff of damp felt, the hart turns into a hat. It's a top hat, but one that doesn't take itself quite seriously; the sort of hat used to conceal rabbits in magic shows.

He runs his fingers over the surface of the machine, checking for hot spots. Brock goes on about the importance of abstracts.

>get hat
We pick up the hat.

>x hat
It's a top hat, but one that doesn't take itself quite seriously; the sort of hat used to conceal rabbits in magic shows.

We settle the hat on our head and adjust our hair underneath.

He's looking at us, but when I look back, he cuts his eyes away. This is like a very surreal blind date.

>remove hat
We pull off the hat and smoothe down our hair.

He watches us with a slightly disturbing intentness in his eyes. I take some comfort from the idea that he wouldn't hit on me if I were in my own body.

>put hat in t-inserter
There is a loud and satisfying pop from the machine as it turns the hat into a that.

It's a curious little object, having no particular weight or size; whenever I look at it, I find myself concentrating on something else — like, say, at this moment, the T-inserter machine.

"Check," says Brock. "And that's all we need here. Now..." He hesitates. "One person escaping is easier than two, I suppose."

I should point out my copy of The Problem of Adjectives. I should have taken it back to the library — I meant to take it back to the library — but there just wasn't time. The last couple of hours before I came to meet you were frantic. The way I figured it, my parents or someone will come looking for me and they'll take it back for me. I think.

>drop mother
We put down my mother.

We're about to, when the door to the street opens and my mother walks into the room. She shuts it behind her and puts away her key before she notices us. Then she stands very still. For about a quarter second she considers calling the police, but I can see that worry passing away again as she takes in our clothing, age, and general demeanor.

"Hi there," she says, coming forward to take our hand. "I'm Mrs. Rosehip. Alex Rosehip's mother. You must be a friend of his?"

I'm inclined to say we're his girlfriend.

>open backpack
We open the backpack.

My mother picks up The Problem of Adjectives from the futon. Mother just stands there with an arched eyebrow. Any minute now I'm going to blurt something out through sheer force of habit.

I'd like to say we're his girlfriend.

>say we're
"Yes — sort of. We've been... I mean, we've been on a few dates." That's you, and I have to say you don't sound as keen on dating ourself as you might.

She raises her eyebrows. "I see. How secretive of him not to bring you around. And where is Alex now? I need to speak with him. He's been hard to reach lately."

I know you think it's a bit sketchy that my mother just walks into my apartment when I'm not around, but I swear to you she's never done that before. She must be more worried about something than she's letting on.

My response would be to claim to have seen him this morning or say we don't know.

>z
Mother picks her way to the refrigerator, which she opens, revealing only some yogurt.

"Evidently not planning to have dinner at home this evening," she comments.

We could explain we might go out.

>close backpack
We close the backpack.

"How well do you know him?" Mother asks. She immediately catches herself, and adds: "I'm not inquiring into the details of your relationship. But I am concerned about him. He has seemed very unhappy recently about his work. Has he said anything to you about that? Wanting to leave the program, or change careers, or... anything?"

I didn't think she'd noticed.

I'm inclined to reassure Mother or suggest the truth.

>z
She gives the refrigerator door a little push and it swings closed.

"Well," Mother says. "I had better go. If you do see Alex, tell him to call me, please. It isn't an emergency, but you can tell him there's a bit of Bureau business I'd like to discuss with him."

We nod. My mother puts The Problem of Adjectives down on the counter. She's going, and suddenly it is borne in on me that this may be the last I see of my mother in a lifetime: and I'm trying to memorize the exact cut of her hair and the way her expensive Italian heels tap on the floor, and meanwhile she is going out completely indifferent to the moment. I could have stood for our previous meeting to be the last one — we had dinner and she hugged me goodbye then. This makes it all much much worse.

And you, you're nattering at me in our head, asking what she meant about the Bureau. It might be, I guess, that they've been watching me and that she got wind of it. That would be likely. But if so it doesn't matter, not any more.

She's not even visible through the window any longer.

At the center of the room is a gleaming new T-inserter Machine. This is a state of the art device: letter removal has been well understood for decades, but insertion is much more dangerous and difficult, fraught with ambiguity.

>purloin tub
[Purloined.]

>autoupgrade
>unmonkey
>gel rock
We dip out a pea-sized quantity of gel and rub it gently onto the rock. With an audible SPLORT, the rock becomes Brock. He looks a bit haggard to me, but I don't think anything too horrible has happened to him. So perhaps you can stop worrying.

I'm starting to understand how you got into all the places you got into. Not that I judge you or your line of work, of course.

Brock stands, dusting himself off. He looks us up and down without expression, without any sign of recognition. "What day is it?" he asks.

"Still Serial Comma Day," you say. "Brock, it's me. And Alex, but I'm here."

The waxen look melts and he grins. "Thank god. It's harder than you'd expect being a rock."

We could suggest we get out of here, complain about Brock's recklessness, or rejoice that Brock is okay. Then again, we could just get to work so we can be out of here faster.

[Your score has gone up by one point.]

>suggest we get out
"You've been a lump of igneous all day," you say. "It's getting dark out there. If we don't get out now, we're going to get caught by some janitor with a privative affixer."

"I didn't have time to run the tests I wanted to run on the T-inserter. It'll take three minutes and then we can go. We need to do abstracts, animates, and a stability check."

Brock roots around in his pockets and fishes out a sign. "I picked this up in the hallway, if it's any use," he says. He tosses it in the corner.

I'd like to insist on leaving immediately or accept Brock's lunacy. Maybe it's not worth it, though.

>insist
I say, "If we get caught down here, we'll all be put on trial, my father could lose his job, the professor who helped me get in here might face prosecution..."

"Not to mention the part," you cut in, "where we all get stuck on a shelf to eternally contemplate the spelling of 'knickknack'."

"Four consonants in a row, baby," he murmurs. "You know what makes me hot."

"Brock." The warning tone in your voice gets through to him, whereas apparently he has zero interest in the welfare of my entire social circle.

"Three minutes. The value of that data could be in the millions."

He knocks on the top of the T-inserter. "First we should see whether this thing can reify abstracts."

I'd like to complain about Brock's recklessness or discover why Brock got stuck here. Or, then again, there's always finishing the job.

>wave g-remover at sign
We smoothly, and almost without thinking about it, reset your device to be a G-remover. With a distinct whiff of sulfur, the sign turns into a sin. An abstract representation of pettiness of spirit and obsession with needless detail, embodied by the image of a grey-skinned bureaucrat and a huge heap of papers.

He's studiously looking around the room. "I've half a mind to explore a little while we're down here just about unsupervised," Brock says reflectively.

I glare at him.

"I know there's no time," he says. "But there are supposed to be all sorts of things in the Bureau sub-basement that have never seen the light of day. DCL projects that went wrong, secret government experiments, possibly a buried command center."

We want to complain about Brock's recklessness, discover why Brock got stuck here, or ask what buried command center he heard of. Or, then again, there's always finishing the job.

[Your score has gone up by one point and is now two.]

>put sin in the t-inserter
(first taking the sin)
There are two small pops from the machine as it turns the sin into a stint.

The flickering images represent a period of time spent in the military: a young person in a uniform, smartly waving goodbye to hazily-sketched parents; a duration of training and mostly boring patrol work; release from service, with a few mild commendations and some pocket money.

"Right. It's good on abstracts, then," Brock says, contemplating the stint.

He pauses, listening for noises outside. "Next it would be good to see if this thing can build animates."

[Your score has gone up by one point and is now three.]

>gel stint
We dip out a pea-sized quantity of gel and rub it gently onto the stint. With an audible SPLORT, the stint becomes a sign.

>wave g-remover at sign
The sign gives way to the now-familiar sin.

Brock is looking at everything but us. I look away again.

>wave s-remover at sin
We run our thumb over the dial, setting the device to an S-remover. The device buzzes, puzzled. It is unable to create anything recognizable called "in".

He knocks on the top of the T-inserter. "If it can't do animates, that might be down to a legal restriction, of course, rather than a technical one, but I imagine that they'd be demo'ing a fully-capable product in this context."

>i
We are equipped with the following essentials: your S-remover (upgraded to handle animates and abstracts) and a tub of restoration gel.

>put sin in t-inserter
We momentarily lift the sin out of the T-inserter machine and then drop it back in.

There are two small pops from the machine as it turns the sin into a stint.

He cranes to look around at the back of the machine, but doesn't find anything interesting. "Have you got anything that's just a T away from being a living animal?"

>wave s-remover at stint
There is a smell of anise, and the stint turns into a tint. A light shade of sky blue, as though someone had watercolored that bit of air.

He stands back, regarding the T-inserter thoughtfully. Brock mentions again that he'd like to see whether the machine can do an animate.

>wave n-remover at tint
We reset the device to n. With a distinct whiff of fresh air, the tint turns into a tit. A small, harmless-looking bird.

He eyes the tit. "Oh for a homonym paddle."

The tit clambers out of the T-inserter machine.

>wave t-remover at tit
We reset the device to t. There is a flash of psychedelic colors, and the tit turns into an I. It's an abstract that looks like a bit of mirror. When I look at it I see Alex, my proper self, and not just restored to my usual body, but photo-retouched to be that bit smarter and freer of skin-blemishes, well-dressed. It's like looking in the mirror at reality as it should be.

You doubtless see yourself too — as you are, or perhaps as you want to be.

He cocks his head to look at the I. "I have surprisingly good hair for someone who has just been a rock."

"Objects in mirror may appear more attractive than they are," we remark.

>put i in t-inserter
(first taking the I)
There are two small pops from the machine as it turns the I into a tit.

Of course, there were other options there: the T-inserter could have made two words. But it seems to be disambiguating to the tit. The question now is whether it would do so consistently or whether its behavior is underdetermined; we don't have time for a really thorough trial set, but checking a couple more times may be indicative.

"No problem creating creatures," Brock says judiciously.

He runs a hand over the brass plate. "As our next trick we need to look at the stabilization performance," Brock says. "Inserters sometimes run into trouble if there's a case where the same base word could be expanded to multiple derivatives — for instance, if you S-inserted CREAM, it wouldn't know whether to make CREAMS or SCREAM or SCREAMS."

The tit clambers out of the T-inserter machine.

>wave t-remover at tit
The tit gives way to the now-familiar I.

He pauses, listening for noises outside. "Some inserters," Brock goes on, "have controls to let you insert the minimum or maximum possible number of letters."

>put i in t-inserter
(first taking the I)
There is a loud and satisfying pop from the machine as it turns the I into an it. It's itself. It. The epitome of itness. Philosophers would pay millions.

There now: the T-inserter has constructed both tit and it. Not very stable, it seems. Slango will be interested to know that.

"Check," says Brock. "And that's all we need here. Now..." He hesitates. "One person escaping is easier than two, I suppose."

You start to object, but I say, "Yes, you'd better return to petrified form." You know I'm right. He'll be easier to carry.

A little grimly, he produces his own letter-remover and repeats the B-removal that made him in the first place. Once again we're alone in a room with a rock.

[Your score has gone up by three points and is now six.]

>get rock
We get the rock. Heavy, dark, and roughly hexagonal, like a slice of basalt column.

>i
We are equipped with the following essentials: a rock, your T-remover (upgraded to handle animates and abstracts), and a tub of restoration gel.

>get rock
We already have that.

Bureau Basement Secret Section
The heightened security on this side of the door is obvious everywhere we look. The floor is tiled in paisley tiles. The light fixtures give off pale pink light. The walls are covered in frog leather. The doors are locked with padlocks the size of handbags, locks decorated à la Louis Quinze, combination locks made of solid gold. There is not a bare noun in sight.

The cute security door at the south end is solidly shut.

The hallway runs from south (comparatively normal) to north (deeply frightening). Just west is the equipment testing room.

"Alex."

I can't help it: I stop and turn. It's too ingrained in me. And it's my father's voice.

He's wearing his ordinary work clothes, but he looks strained to the point of fracture. And someone could come out of any of these doors at any moment.

"Your mother told me about meeting your supposed girlfriend at your apartment. She was puzzled by that, but I knew what must have happened," my father says, in a very low voice. "I deleted the record of your unauthorized synthesizer draining the power grid, which, by the way, could get me dismissed."

I'm inclined to deny everything.

>shrug
We shrug. It feels like being a teenager again.

"I didn't tell your mother what I suspected, but when it comes out you've… defected… I won't be able to keep this from her. And you're giving up your career. Mine too, possibly; we'll all be under suspicion, I suppose.

"It's pointless. You could have done a great deal for the Bureau from within. I was trying to help you see that."

I'd like to lay out our reasons or be comforting.

>g
Another shrug. I wish he'd stop talking.

"So your partners in crime are, what, smugglers? Industrial saboteurs? That's wonderful. Finally some role models."

We could quibble or deny being a spy.

>g
Another shrug. I wish he'd stop talking.

"You've left enough traces that people will know someone came in here today."

>g
Another shrug. I wish he'd stop talking.

"Here's what we're going to do, Alex. You're going in there—" (he points at a door to the southwest) "—and I'm going to call for backup to arrest the first person that comes out. That could be Alex, it could be whoever-else-you-are, it could be both of you in this same body.

"If it is Alex who comes back out, I can't possibly save your university career, but we might be able to make a case for clemency." What he means by that— oh. Yes. I understand now.

He gives us a hard shove. We're half inside the room when we hear his last remark:

"Alex... don't try to escape back through the Rotunda. If you really can't come home, then head north. I've never seen it, but supposedly there's an emergency exit up there."

Then he's gone.

Cold Storage
Shelves on both sides of the room are full of objects on stands: objects that used to be men and women, and in a few cases even children. The stand labels preserve their original names.

A duty roster is posted prominently.

If this goes wrong, we could wind up living in here permanently. So we'd better figure whom to send out, and do it fast.

>g
We shrug.

This is nothing less than the command center for a massive propaganda campaign. Paintings of Atlantida and polling charts cover the walls, dating back to the second world war and continuing straight through to the present.

There are a paperweight and an inciting fable on the long table.

I vote we gel Brock and send him out to my father. No, hear me out. Brock's cover is probably not in great shape anyway. You might be able to rescue him later. And it would be a coup for my father to have a real big arrest to put on the record.

>wave h-remover at power chord
We reset the device to h. There is a distinct spearmint flavor, and the power chord turns into a power cord. This is the heaviest-duty cabling I've ever seen in my life: thick as a snake, covered in yellow sheathing, with a massive plug at each end.

Oracle Project
This is nothing less than the command center for a massive propaganda campaign. Paintings of Atlantida and polling charts cover the walls, dating back to the second world war and continuing straight through to the present.

There are a paperweight and an inciting fable on the long table.

>x paintings
The paintings are old, 19th-century affairs, and they show Atlantida larger than life, typically wearing blue, with a sort of French academy face and bare feet. The squid is a frequent motif in the background, as it represents inventiveness, strength, and the ability to try many things at once.

>x charts
Blue lines on the charts record the citizen responses to the concept of Atlantida. They record wartime progress in establishing the concept in the popular imagination, with a spike in 1942, corresponding to a heavy press of propaganda.

After the war, there's a break in the charts until 1951, when tracking resumes. Additional spikes appear at 1968 and 1972.

Each chart also shows a yellow line, which roughly goes down as the blue line goes up. It is labeled "Power to generate animate abstract." The yellow line stops at 1982 and no further points are recorded on it.

>x fable
It's a short children's tale, with illustrations. A young boy was left an orphan in a certain village. So he went door to door around the village, but none of the families would take him in, all having some excuse: there were too many children already, the house was too small, there was not enough food, the parents were too old for a new child, and so on.

Despondent, the boy was on the verge of giving up when a magician came to town. He went around door to door with the boy a second time, this time asking each household for just one letter. When he was done, he used a powerful machine on the letters in his bag, and transformed them into a LOVING FAMILY!

(The text ends here, but the illustration shows the boy beaming in the arms of a manufactured mother, father, siblings, hamster, and goldfish.)

>gel paperweight
We dip out a pea-sized quantity of gel and rub it gently onto the paperweight. With an audible SPLORT, the paperweight becomes a weight and a paper.

>gel fable
We dip out a pea-sized quantity of gel and rub it gently onto the inciting fable. With an audible SPLORT, the inciting fable becomes a filing cabinet. There are numerous files, and they are organized chronologically, so that it's possible to look up a specific year. They appear to begin in 1942.

>look up 1942 in cabinet
Checking through the filing cabinet for 1942 reveals some images of Atlantida. Here is her militant 1940s rendition, where she stands bestride Atlantis; Axis planes are flying past her at head level. At any moment she might bite one and shake it, like a bulldog.

>look up 1982 in cabinet
A business-like, formidable Atlantida in the early 80s, looking Strong On Defense and Tough On Misspelling, with an olive branch in one hand and an anagramming gun in the other.

>look up 1962 in cabinet
There's nothing much for 1962, but there are files for 1958 and 1964. Other promising-looking years are 1942, 1982, 1983, and 2003.

>look up 1958
A sassy, security-conscious spirit of Atlantis, wearing a secretarial suit and putting a finger to her lips: the wink apparently means that it's alluring not to tell things to spies.

>look up 1964
This dossier contains a political cartoon: under comic OOPS lettering, Atlantida is seen shoveling dirt back over an assortment of ancient-looking lamps, pottery, and broken columns. Probably a reference to that incident where a portion of a Roman villa came to light and caused a temporary disruption in the strength of local conversions.

>look up 2003
The dossier for 2003 is very thick. Memos back and forth indicate that officials are increasingly concerned with Atlantida and feel it is time (for some reason) to reclaim the figure as a "government-positive" image. Consultations with an expensive New York advertising firm and a series of tv spots do not seem to have had the desired effect, however, because the project was canceled.

>look up 1983 in cabinet
This year's folder doesn't contain any official propaganda posters; instead it's bulging with copies of a protest leaflet that shows a bare-breasted Atlantida leading rebels against the Bureau of Orthography, carrying placards in favor of more referenda and true individual liberty.

>x paper
It contains a memo, dated to May of 1983. "Attention," it says. "Due to subversive counter-propaganda altering the abstract concept, Subject A must NO LONGER BE GELLED AFTER USE, since reconstructing her may produce anomalous results. She will from now on be housed in a continuous living state in the historic apartments."

>x weight
Shaped like a headless pyramid. "0.5 kg" is stamped in the top together with the seal of the Bureau. It's an official weight, intended to reassure citizens that they were getting a genuine standard measure.

>get weight
We pick up the weight.

A first aid station is built onto the wall. It is closed.

Most of the room is taken up with a gigantic boiler installation that is currently off. The locking mechanism is a brushed steel bucket, currently empty.

>put pastis in bucket
There is a churning noise from within the brushed steel bucket, and a moment later we see inside some pestos. Glass jars contain three types of local pesto: a traditional basil and garlic variety, a sun-dried tomato pesto, and the infamous squid-flake pesto. The jars are packaged in a glossy cardboard box, suitable for taking back to one's mother-in-law after a trip to Atlantis.

This appears to have unlocked the mechanism. With a growl, the boiler comes to life.

This passage has been cut through natural cliff rock and looks older than the Bureau itself. The walls are rough-hewn, exposing sedimentary strata. Here and there it looks as though someone has actually excavated a favored rock or relic.

Personal Apartment
At a guess, this is a room hardly anyone ever visits, or even knows about. Though the ceiling and one wall are bare cave, the rest has been paneled and graciously decorated in the style of the end of the 18th century. Oil paintings on the walls depict great men and women of Atlantis gone by: Phyllida Shaply, Amelia Landison, Clarence Arbot, Jon Rosehip. An antique bed stands in the center of the room.

The metal portcullis guards the way back. It is currently raised. From the pulley above the portcullis hangs a counterweight.

There are a stack of files and a rubber stamp on the inlaid desk.

Air and sunlight stream in from the east.


Please press SPACE to continue.

"Don't move, Alexandra, or I'll split you in two."

A very tall woman with Bureau-blue eyes steps into the room from the east, carrying a restoration gel rifle. Her face is ageless, her mouth full-lipped but proud. We've never met, but we recognize her at once.

Atlantida moves the rifle a fraction and fires through the portcullis at the counterweight. With an audible SPLORT, the counterweight becomes a weight and a counter.

The weight falls to the ground.

The portcullis crashes shut.

>throw rock at atlantida
We fling the rock at Atlantida, but with a swipe of her arm she deflects it to the bed.

She fires again. The pellet hits us, cold and hard, in the shoulder. It stings like hell and for a moment I think our clavicle is broken. We put our hand over the wounded spot.

Our hand.

Atlantida lowers the rifle, surprised. "Fused," she says. "Isn't that interesting. And so recently, too. If the gel rifle won't separate you, nothing will." She smiles, not warmly. "Pity. You would have been easier to deal with separately. Cold Storage for Andra, house arrest for Alex."

We can't reasonably carry the whole stack of pans, so they fall to the floor with a dramatic crash.

Fused? We should be two pieces by now. Maybe she has an explanation? But you seem to be focused on her gun hand. How can you be so calm?

>throw paper at atlantida
We fling the page at Atlantida, but it bounces off unexcitingly and lands on the inlaid desk.

Atlantida smiles with half a mouth. "You've arrived on a difficult day. In the ordinary course of things, I keep things quiet: the spirit of democracy, but none of the sordid wrangling and bribes and corruption and compromise. It's only when the spirit of the island itself is threatened, that we have to resort to such extreme measures."

/(We could|I'd like to|We want to|I'm inclined to|My response would be to) ask whether the protesters feel the same way.

>throw plans at atlantida
The plans make a poor projectile and land back near our own feet.

"Do you think the protesters would feel happier if there had been a citizen referendum where their position had been voted down? The outcome would have been just the same, but they would feel much more responsible for it; surely an unpleasant position for them to be in, considering their moral objections."

>throw sword at atlantida
We cast the sword, javelin-like, at Atlantida's heart, but miss. Her expression is disdainful.

"And now it's time for you to go," Atlantida says.

She presses a button on something in her hand. Far away, a high-pitched bell rings.

"Did you have anything else you wanted to ask me? I so rarely get to talk with ordinary citizens. Only ones with clearance, and those about to go into Cold Storage. A last interview with Saint Peter."

>throw tub at atlantida
We fling the tub at her. Unfortunately, the gel is sticky enough that it doesn't, as we had sort of hoped, spill out all over her. She dodges, then hurls it back at us — and she has better aim.

"Oh, no, my dear," Atlantida says. "They could remake me, but it wouldn't be the same me, would it? It would be some new construct. The Atlantida of today. And that's not the way to a consistent policy, is it?"

>throw pans at atlantida
That would certainly be a mighty blow if we could heft the pans in the first place.

There are noises in the next room, and a moment later a couple of All-Purpose Officers burst into the room, gel rifles and real rifles drawn.

"You're slow," Atlantida says, seating herself on the ridiculous bed. "I thought we had trained for this eventuality."

The officer nearest the door turns red. "This has been a busy day, madam," he says. As though she were a queen.

That is, that's what would have happened if we had done something so foolish. Shall we suppose we didn't? >>
>yes

>throw ire at atlantida
The ire wouldn't make much impact, other than perhaps notionally. And Atlantida doesn't look like she's open to persuasion, even if the concept of the ire were one that carried weight in this situation.

Fleur d'Or Drinks Club
The back wall is dramatically decorated with bottled liquors of all sorts, from gin to cachaça; there's a giant bottle of Campari, taller than your average three-year-old, with a red ribbon around its neck.

What makes this place technically a drinks club rather than a bar is its license to serve letter-manufactured food and drink. A toolkit on the bar contains some screwdrivers, some gimlets, and some rusty nails, ready to be transformed into their respective cocktails.

The bartender is in the middle of showing her homonym paddle to a patron holding a gin and tonic. The other patrons are scattered around the room at small tables, drinking or talking among themselves.

She acknowledges us with a nod as we stroll up to the bar and get close enough to hear their conversation. "It was originally produced as a toy, but it's actually a bit dangerous," the bartender is saying.

"Dangerous? How so?" asks the patron.

"Various ways," she says. "Suppose I hit a small object that has a big homonym, like say a plane. You know, the carpentry kind. Suddenly I've got an airplane-style plane on top of me."

>autoupgrade
"What if you hit something that doesn't mean anything else?" the patron asks. "Like a chicken?"

"Nothing," she says. "That's safe." As though to demonstrate, she smacks the paddle against her left buttock. "See? I don't get changed into a different bartender. Want to try?"

She holds up the paddle as though she's going to tap him with it.

"Uh... my name is Mark," he says.

"Maybe not, then!" she says, laughing brightly.

>wave p-remover at patron
We reset the device to p. The letter-remover finds no p in Mark.

"That was a little dangerous, wasn't it?" Mark asks. "If you had tapped me with that thing, wouldn't I be a giant X on the carpet now?"

"Not for long," the bartender says. "I do have some restoration gel for emergencies. Or I could just hit you again with the paddle. But there would be an incident report and I could lose my license. So, yeah, better not."

>wave m-remover at patron
We reset the device to m. With a distinct whiff of newly sawn planks, Mark turns into an ark. From here, the width of the bow in cubits is hard to guess. It just looks huge, much too huge for the little space it's crammed into…

Unfortunately, the ark is more than sufficient to bury us under its bulk.

That is, that's what would have happened if we had done something so foolish. Shall we suppose we didn't? >>

Rectification Room
This is where equipment is brought for a tune-up, or to have its legal limits reinstalled (or, on rare occasions, removed). Access to these abilities is tightly controlled by the Bureau.

The reclamation machine stands near the door, ready to improve forbidden objects for the use of registered departmental users. It's very ordinary looking, a simple machine with leads able to attach to various linguistic equipment, and to read and rewrite the programming.

A pleasantly sheltered lane in which I learned to ride a bicycle, and where my friend Lucy used to live, before she and her parents moved off-island. Restrictions were looser even twenty years ago. Our old schoolhouse is just west of here.

If you look just north between the houses, you'll notice also the footpath down to an almost-private beach. It used to be open, but it's now gated off, and built into the gate is a chic modern sculpture.

The plans are rolled up and stuck shut with a label that reads "PROPERTY OF DENTAL CONSONANTS LIMITED — UNAUTHORIZED USE ILLEGAL". They're just a set of prints from the main computer design, of course, but still extremely informative: to the right engineer, they might reveal the secret of T-insertion for replication by other companies.

We smoothly, and almost without thinking about it, reset your device to be an L-remover. There is a smell of anise, and the plans turn into some pans. A set of flat skillets in cast iron: extremely bulky and heavy.

We can't reasonably carry the whole stack of pans, so they fall to the ground with a dramatic crash.

>wave s-remover at pans
We reset the device to s. There is a flash of psychedelic colors, and the pans turn into a pan. An omelet-sized skillet in cast iron.

>wave n-remover at pan
We reset the device to n. With a distinct whiff of shaving cream, the pan turns into a pa. He's a Norman Rockwell figure: gruff, upstanding, honest, not a big talker. Doesn't actually come with a child attached, but it stands to reason he would have a large-ish brood of them.

>wave a-remover at soap
We reset the device to a. With a distinct whiff of stale wine, the soap turns into a sop. A hunk of bread dipped in something red-brown.

>put sop on spinner

We put the sop on the pedestal.

The mirror revolves for a moment, without changing the sop, though the word "pos" appears in startling green on the mirror's surface.

>put gel on sop
We dip out a fingertip-coating quantity of gel and rub it gently onto the sop. With an audible SPLORT, the sop becomes some soap.

I'm starting to understand how you got into all the places you got into. Not that I judge you or your line of work, of course.

There is a churning noise from within the brushed steel bucket, and a moment later we see inside some pestos. Glass jars contain three types of local pesto: a traditional basil and garlic variety, a sun-dried tomato pesto, and the infamous squid-flake pesto. The jars are packaged in a glossy cardboard box, suitable for taking back to one's mother-in-law after a trip to Atlantis.

We leap forward and slash with the sword. She dodges.

She fires again. The pellet hits us, cold and hard, in the shoulder. It stings like hell and for a moment I think our clavicle is broken. We put our hand over the wounded spot.

Our hand.

Atlantida lowers the rifle, surprised. "Fused," she says. "Isn't that interesting. And so recently, too. If the gel rifle won't separate you, nothing will." She smiles, not warmly. "Pity. You would have been easier to deal with separately. Cold Storage for Andra, house arrest for Alex."

Fused? We should be two pieces by now. Maybe she has an explanation? But you seem to be focused on her gun hand. How can you be so calm?

>hit atlantida with foil
Atlantida raises the rifle and fires with certain aim before the blow has a chance to land.
[gel-convert: BUG! The fossil is not in the repository. It will be moved from the Crumbling Wall Face to ourselves.]
With an audible SPLORT, the foil becomes a fossil.

Atlantida smiles with half a mouth. "You've arrived on a difficult day. In the ordinary course of things, I keep things quiet: the spirit of democracy, but none of the sordid wrangling and bribes and corruption and compromise. It's only when the spirit of the island itself is threatened, that we have to resort to such extreme measures."

My response would be to ask whether the protesters feel the same way.

>hit atlantida with stick
We leap forward and slash with the stick. She parries the blow with the body of the restoration gel rifle. It doesn't even look damaged.

"Do you think the protesters would feel happier if there had been a citizen referendum where their position had been voted down? The outcome would have been just the same, but they would feel much more responsible for it; surely an unpleasant position for them to be in, considering their moral objections."

Atlantida raises the rifle and fires with certain aim before the blow has a chance to land.

With an audible SPLORT, the sill becomes a spill.

The spill drips through our fingers onto the floor.

"And now it's time for you to go," Atlantida says.

She presses a button on something in her hand. Far away, a high-pitched bell rings.

"Did you have anything else you wanted to ask me? I so rarely get to talk with ordinary citizens. Only ones with clearance, and those about to go into Cold Storage. A last interview with Saint Peter."

>hit atlantida with leaf
We leap forward and slash with the leaf. She wards us off with the rifle.

Tunnel through Chalk
This passage has been cut through natural cliff rock and looks older than the Bureau itself. The walls are rough-hewn, exposing sedimentary strata. Here and there it looks as though someone has actually excavated a favored rock or relic.

Blocking the far end of the corridor is a metal portcullis. It is currently lowered. From the pulley above the portcullis hangs a counter.

We can go east through the portcullis (closed) and up from here.

I would not know how to do this, but you have sufficient expert skill that we've got the gun loaded up in no time.

>put counterweight on hook
The hook can only really hold one thing at a time. We take the counter. One of those devices with a press-button to increment a number, to assist with counting things like the number of people attending an event. There's also a loop to let the user wear it over one finger. The counter currently reads 17.

We hang the counterweight on the hook. The portcullis shifts slightly but doesn't rise on its own. Perhaps with a little help, though.

>open portcullis
We open the portcullis.

>go through portcullis

Personal Apartment
At a guess, this is a room hardly anyone ever visits, or even knows about. Though the ceiling and one wall are bare cave, the rest has been paneled and graciously decorated in the style of the end of the 18th century. Oil paintings on the walls depict great men and women of Atlantis gone by: Phyllida Shaply, Amelia Landison, Clarence Arbot, Jon Rosehip. An antique bed stands in the center of the room.

The metal portcullis guards the way back. It is currently raised. From the pulley above the portcullis hangs a counterweight.

On the inlaid desk are a stack of files and a rubber stamp.

Air and sunlight stream in from the east.

Please press SPACE to continue.

"Don't move, Alexandra, or I'll split you in two."

A very tall woman with Bureau-blue eyes steps into the room from the east, carrying a restoration gel rifle. Her face is ageless, her mouth full-lipped but proud. We've never met, but we recognize her at once.

Atlantida moves the rifle a fraction and fires through the portcullis at the counterweight.
[gel-convert: BUG! The counter is not in the repository. It will be moved from ourselves to the pulley.]
With an audible SPLORT, the counterweight becomes a weight and a counter.

The weight falls to the ground.

The portcullis crashes shut.

>open tub
We open the tub, revealing some restoration gel.

She fires again. The pellet hits us, cold and hard, in the shoulder. It stings like hell and for a moment I think our clavicle is broken. We put our hand over the wounded spot.

Our hand.

Atlantida lowers the rifle, surprised. "Fused," she says. "Isn't that interesting. And so recently, too. If the gel rifle won't separate you, nothing will." She smiles, not warmly. "Pity. You would have been easier to deal with separately. Cold Storage for Andra, house arrest for Alex."

Fused? We should be two pieces by now. Maybe she has an explanation? But you seem to be focused on her gun hand. How can you be so calm?

>x files
Even a quick look through the titles gives some idea. "DCL Plausibility studies on a syllable-removing gun." "Economic impact study towards an S-inserter, with particular attention to factory closures and workforce reduction in the developing world." "Single-noun Targeted Bomb." "Popular Opinion Study Concerning Utopian Linguistics." "Monthly Counterintelligence Report on Progress towards Manipulation of Simplified Chinese Character Set."

There are others like this, some thin, some fat with paperwork and sticky notes.

>a cold storage
"How do you excuse putting people in Cold Storage? It's a human rights violation."

Atlantida makes a motion as though brushing away an insect. "The laws of Atlantis are special. They keep us strong; they keep the rest of the world safe."

There's a brief pause. Atlantida smiles with half a mouth. "You've arrived on a difficult day. In the ordinary course of things, I keep things quiet: the spirit of democracy, but none of the sordid wrangling and bribes and corruption and compromise. It's only when the spirit of the island itself is threatened, that we have to resort to such extreme measures."

My response would be to ask whether the protesters feel the same way.

At a guess, this is a room hardly anyone ever visits, or even knows about. Though the ceiling and one wall are bare cave, the rest has been paneled and graciously decorated in the style of the end of the 18th century. Oil paintings on the walls depict great men and women of Atlantis gone by: Phyllida Shaply, Amelia Landison, Clarence Arbot, Jon Rosehip. An antique bed stands in the center of the room.

Atlantida stands between us and the eastern exit, backlit by sunlight. The restoration gel rifle hangs loose in her hand.

The metal portcullis guards the way back. It is currently lowered. From the pulley above the portcullis hangs a counter.

There are a stack of files and a rubber stamp on the inlaid desk.

Air and sunlight stream in from the east.

>shoot anagramming gun at gel rifle
The gun fires ruggedly into the restoration gel rifle, which shatters and then reforms as an infertile astrologer. She's a woman with long grey hair, well past menopause.

The infertile astrologer falls awkwardly to earth and looks around in confusion.

"Mercury is in retrograde," comments the astrologer. "Expect disordered communications."

"Oh, bravo," says Atlantida. "Could you possibly have made a less useful ally?"

The infertile astrologer is idly check out the counter. Her wanderings are gradually moving her closer to us.

The metal portcullis guards the way back. It is currently lowered. From the pulley above the portcullis hangs a counter.

Air and sunlight stream in from the east.

>gel astrologer
We dip out a pea-sized quantity of gel and rub it gently onto the infertile astrologer. With an audible SPLORT, the infertile astrologer becomes a restoration gel rifle.

I'm starting to understand how you got into all the places you got into. Not that I judge you or your line of work, of course.

Atlantida realizes that the restoration gel rifle is now a couple of meters away from her.

She presses a button on something in her hand. Far away, a high-pitched bell rings.

"Did you have anything else you wanted to ask me? I so rarely get to talk with ordinary citizens. Only ones with clearance, and those about to go into Cold Storage. A last interview with Saint Peter."

[Your score has gone up by one point and is now two.]

>shoot gel rifle at atlantida
We pick up the rifle. It fits well in your hand: good heft. I feel like we know how to aim this thing. It's illegal to carry, but that doesn't seem to be bothering you right now.

Her eyes follow the gesture. "Don't you dare, you little traitor," she says. "I have been your mother, your father, your waking up and your going to sleep, your teachers and your lovers and your friends. I am the integrity of this island. Change me and you change Atlantis forever."

High Street
Hustle, bustle, dirt; ugly American chain shops; lots and lots of people. There seems to be a large organized protest in progress: protesters completely cram the sidewalk to the southeast.

The curb is lined with garbage.

To the west, the street turns into a monumental staircase leading to the old fortified area — your hostel should be up that way — while a cross street heads southeast towards the main roundabout.

From a loudspeaker nearby comes the electronic sound of simulated bells ringing the hour after noon. It's later than I thought. We'd better get a move on.

...and... Slango is not here.

This is bad. Even I can see this is bad. What happened to your confidence in your team? Where are the guys who are supposed to get us out of here?

>wave h-remover at chard
We smoothly, and almost without thinking about it, reset your device to be an H-remover. With a distinct whiff of crisp, snappy cardboard, the chard turns into a card. Not a playing card, as I might have expected, or a calling card, or even an index card, but a Tarot card, representing the Chariot. The vehicle is drawn by two prize horses, one black, one white. The driver appears to be having some difficulty keeping them together, to judge from the surly expression and the raised whip.

The chair is far too large for us to carry, and falls onto the ground.

[Your score has gone up by one point.]

>wave d-remover at card
We run our thumb over the dial, setting the device to a D-remover. With a distinct whiff of metal parts and oil, the card turns into a car. It is little larger than a toy, but that is what you want when driving on the streets around here. Any substantial vehicle wouldn't fit down the winding drives.

Here is how my mother gets around. She takes a 300 Euro Hermès scarf with an orange border and a pattern of prancing horses. She tosses it in the air. As it falls, she shoots it twice, like a clay pigeon: once to take out the F, the second time for the S. And such a car: buttery leather seats, jaguar lines. If someone asks how she gets such good results, she jokes that it's because of her quality materials.

Suffice it to say that we are not similarly blessed.

The car is far too large for us to carry, and falls onto the ground.

>wave n-remover at funnel
We reset the device to n. With a distinct whiff of volatile fumes, the funnel turns into some fuel. It looks like a generic canister of unleaded gasoline.

The soil is too awkward for us to carry, and falls onto the ground.

>wave i-remover at chair
We reset the device to i. With a distinct whiff of faint fishiness, the chair turns into a char. It's a troutlike freshwater fish of the northern countries. It is dead, needless to say, and would make someone a nice supper if they knew how to clean and cook it. Our skills, however, are not up to the task.

>wave h-remover at char
We reset the device to h. With a distinct whiff of metal parts and oil, the char turns into a car. It is little larger than a toy, but that is what you want when driving on the streets around here. Any substantial vehicle wouldn't fit down the winding drives.

>put fuel in car
I deeply fear automotive maintenance, but I can (just) manage to pour in the fuel... and I think that's done it.

[Your score has gone up by three points and is now four.]

>wave b-remover at garbage
We reset the device to b. There is a smell of anise, and the garbage turns into a garage. It is a small but well-furnished garage for minor tuneups and repairs. It even comes with a mechanic: a surprising touch, since letter-removers are usually legally prevented from creating living persons, but sometimes there are glitches if the people are not created directly.

The mechanic nods at us.

>se
We open the car door: perhaps unsurprisingly, it comes without an effective lock system.

We get into the car.

The car refuses to run properly: evidently you got us a lemon. It's going to take some tuning up before it will go.

We want to ask why the car does not run.

>get out
We climb out of the car.

I'd like to ask why the car does not run.

>wave s-remover at fossil
We reset the device to s. There is a mad-scientist cackle, and the fossil turns into a foil. One of those long springy swords used for fencing. It has a button at the tip to prevent harm to one's opponent.

I'd like to ask why the car does not run.

>ask why the car dows not run
If you're trying to converse with other characters, the suggestions in the text provide possible phrasings; so if you read "I might ask about lentils.", you might phrase your command ASK ABOUT LENTILS. Introducing other words or variant phrasings that weren't part of the suggestion may confuse the game.

Alternatively, if you just want to take an action in the game world, try giving a direct command, such as EXAMINE THE ASP or WAVE THE P-REMOVER AT THE PHONEY.

>ask why the car does not run
"There appears to be something wrong with my car," we tell the mechanic.

He has the somewhat cow-like expression of all fake people, but he nods gravely and has a look. "It hasn't been maintained," he says, on inspection. "You got any motor oil?"

>l
High Street
Hustle, bustle, dirt; ugly American chain shops; lots and lots of people. There seems to be a large organized protest in progress: protesters completely cram the sidewalk to the southeast.

A garage has sprung into being between two high-end boutiques. There is a mechanic in the garage.

There are two cars parked nearby.

We can also see some soil here.

To the west, the street turns into a monumental staircase leading to the old fortified area — your hostel should be up that way — while a cross street heads southeast towards the main roundabout.

>show oil to mechanic
I don't know what you think you're talking about, because we can't see any such thing here.

>wave f-remover at foil
We reset the device to f. With a distinct whiff of mechanics and the summer time, the foil turns into some oil. A can of what appears to be motor oil. It is sludgy and black.

>show oil to mechanic
"Will this work?" We hold out the oil.

"Should do," he says. Rolling up his sleeves, he goes to work on the car. There is no small amount of banging and muttering, but finally he stands back and announces that he believes it is now in working condition.

My response would be to thank the mechanic.

Roundabout (jammed into the car)
We are jammed into the car with our knees almost at our chin, looking out through the bulbous little windshield. The motor is growling like a housecat with pneumonia.

The traffic flows in a tight circle around a statue which we can never see clearly.

Confusing signs point in various directions: northeast to Deep Street, northwest to High Street, south to Long Street, east to Tall Street.

>gonear language studies seminar room
(the Language Studies Seminar Room)
Language Studies Seminar Room
They recently redid this room, and whoever picked the decorations had postmodern tastes.

The bookshelves lining the walls contain the department library. On the bookshelf are History of the Standards Revolution and Lives of the Lexicographers.

A massive plexiglas case takes up one corner of the room. In the plexiglas case is a compact but high-powered late model synthesizer.

The big table at the center of the room is an irregular polygon, with one red chair pushed up to the shortest side. I think the shape is intended to undermine traditional conceptions of academic hierarchy, but in practice it just means that whoever gets to seminar late has to sit with a table angle jabbing him in the stomach.
>x chair
It is an ordinary inexpensive variety of chair, made locally and found around the island in great numbers. This one has been painted red.

>wave c-remover at chair

We squeeze ourselves against the wall and angle to reach the screws with the screwdriver. I start on the first screw when—

"Is someone in the Seminar Room?" asks a male voice in the hall. "I thought I heard something."

"I don't think so."

There's a listening silence from outside. We hold absolutely still.

Finally the footsteps move away again. It's probably safe to try again now, when I'm feeling a tiny bit calmer.

>unscrew screws
We awkwardly and silently squeeze against the wall and angle ourself so that we can reach the screws with the screwdriver. It's annoying work, but eventually we do work all the screws free enough that the case could be opened.

>get red

>put red hair in synthesizer
Voices from the hallway. I freeze. For a moment we hear them all too sharply: "You check downstairs, I'll ask the professors." It's a conversation of security guards, or police, or Bureau Officers. Someone is being looked for.

Then it's over. We put the red hair into the synthesizer.

>purloin piece
Which do you mean, the 1) piece, the 2) piece, or the 3) jigsaw piece?

>x piece
It looks like a setting of "The Grammatical Number of Our Enemy (Is Singular)," a popular music-hall piece of the 1890s that still gets trotted out now and then. There are rousing choruses where the audience can join in to represent the enemy sailors just prior to their encounter with the depluralizing cannon.

>put it in synthesizer

Outdoor Café
From this slightly raised terrace, tourists have a view of the activity in the market and out over the docks.

Curiously, there's an acquaintance of yours here: Nexami Engeo is at one of the round black metal tables. He's a musician, the front man of engeo. Your gang helped him out with some customs issues because of his unusual name.

Nexami nods to us. "Watch out. That table next to you has something sticky spilled on it." And indeed there is a spill. You were about to lean on it nonchalantly.

/(I'm inclined to|I'd like to|We want to) say thanks for pointing out spill or ask what he is doing in Atlantis.

If we change the chair while Nexami is sitting on it, he might disappear along with it. Let's not do that.

/(I'm inclined to|I'd like to|We want to) say thanks for pointing out spill or ask what he is doing in Atlantis.

>thanks
"Hey, thanks."

He makes a you're-welcome gesture and goes back to contemplating the sea view.

Nexami stands up and mutters something. I have a little trouble with his Scottish accent — we don't get a lot of that around here, for obvious reasons — but you interpret it as him saying he'd better go pay up.

He heads into the interior of the café.

It is indeed a severed breast. Maybe a C-cup, creamy-skinned and all, but the fact that it looks like it's been raggedly chopped off by a serial killer really decreases the appeal.

>wave t-remover at tit
We run our thumb over the dial, setting the device to a T-remover. The tit flickers and there is a brief image of an I in its place — the concept strangely embodied in a physical form — before the power gives out. I guess your device there just isn't tuned to reify abstracts.

>autoupgrade
>wave t-remover at tit
/There is a [a-z  \-]+, and the tit turns into an I. It's an abstract that looks like a bit of mirror. When I look at it I see Alex, my proper self, and not just restored to my usual body, but photo-retouched to be that bit smarter and freer of skin-blemishes, well-dressed. It's like looking in the mirror at reality as it should be.
