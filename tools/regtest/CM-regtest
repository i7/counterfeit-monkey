Exactly right. And I'm Alex, making us jointly Alexandra. As far as I can tell, the operation was a success. We're meant to be one person now, unrecognizable to anyone who knew us before.

Sigil Street
The buildings here are two and three stories, with shops at ground level and elderly apartments above. The shops are closed for the holiday: a typographer's office, tourist boutiques of colorful skirts and ethnic bodices (rarely if ever worn by natives) and t-shirts covered with font designs.

Passing by the reflective window we catch the sight of our single blended body, and it creeps me out.

A narrow alley runs between buildings to the south, while the street continues east.

> wave u-remover at mourning dress
/We smoothly, and almost without thinking about it, reset your device to be a U-remover. There is a [a-z  \-]+, and the mourning dress turns into a morning dress. An outfit of striped trousers and fancy coat, such as men sometimes wear to fancy weddings in the morning.

[Your score has gone up by one point.]

Ampersand Bend
A bend in the street, which runs west and north. This district combines the old and the new: a small museum in an ancient stone building to the east, a shiny real estate office south. The window of the museum is currently displaying one of its exhibits, a codex.

A temporary barrier blocks this empty street from the busy fair to the north, though there is a door that could be opened with the correct code. From here the gaiety and excitement of the holiday are fairly loud.

> wave x-remover at codex
/We run our thumb over the dial, setting the device to an X-remover. There is a [a-z  \-]+, and the codex turns into a code. A bit of paper on which is written "305."

  Retrieve your remaining possessions from locker at hostel
  Meet your colleague Slango at Counterfeit Monkey

Fair
Today is Serial Comma Day, one of the biggest holidays on the island, and a time when half the police force is off duty while the other half is over-extended. The perfect day to make an escape. The square at the center of town is therefore crowded with people, and there's an overpowering smell of artificial butter and spun sugar.

We are surrounded by kiosks for spell-offs, face-painting, a wheel to spin for prizes, and other activities best for small children or the very easily amused.

The Fair continues with a selection of carnival games to the west, and with open park to the north and east.

[Your score has gone up by three points and is now four.]

> x wheel
It's the sort of game where you spin the wheel for a prize. No one seems to be manning or using it any more, though; perhaps the supply of prizes has run out.

> wave w-remover at wheel
We reset the device to w. We wave the W-remover at the wheel and produce a heel, severed (because after all it would be beyond the parameters of the change to generate the person whose body part it is). It is only moderately gory, and most locals get used to seeing this kind of thing as a prank from six-year-olds every halloween. Still, it might startle a tourist.

> get heel
/We (take|get|pick up|acquire) the heel. Calloused and leathery, a gruesome souvenir of years of unhappy shoe-wearing.

Midway
Here in front of the pharmacy in the southwestern corner of the town square, various contests have been set up — a strong-man hammering contest, a contest to see who can burst the most balloons using a styrofoam dart-plane, and so on.

I assume you've noticed, though, the word-balance, which comes up as high as our hip. On the right pan is an apple and on the left a pear.

Beside the word-balance is a barker in a blue suit, the same regulation blue used by the Bureau of Orthography. The barker has a tube.

/(We could|I'd like to|We want to|I'm inclined to|My response would be to) ask what the gel is worth, ask whether the game is rigged, or ask whether anyone ever wins.

> wave p-remover at apple
We reset the device to p. There's a smell of fermenting apple, then cider, then something more malty. In the apple's place there is now a glass of nutbrown ale.

There is a cheer from the spectators. The word-balance tilts slowly but inexorably.

The barker looks astonished and displeased, except for a fraction of a second when he just noticeably winks. With exaggerated bad grace he hands us some restoration gel. "There's your prize. And now this contest is over."

He stalks away.

/We (take|get|pick up|acquire) the pear. Handsome and green.

> open tub
We open the tub, revealing some restoration gel.

> put gel on pear
We dip out a pea-sized quantity of gel and rub it gently onto the pear. With an audible SPLORT, the pear becomes a pearl. It is small, slightly uneven, and pale blue in color. Not worth very much, but genuine.

I'm starting to understand how you got into all the places you got into. Not that I judge you or your line of work, of course.

/We have a short hike pushing through the dense crowds.|We have a brief walk among the booths of the fair.

Church Garden
One might expect a graveyard, but burial inside the city walls has been forbidden for sanitation reasons since well before the New Church was built. Instead, there is a small meditation garden, which was once designed as an intricate knotwork of shrubs.

The knotwork has since grown into a thicket.

> wave h-remover at thicket
We reset the device to h. The thicket abruptly shrivels and flattens itself, and in its place a ticket flutters to earth.

Hostel
I take it this is where you stayed from the time you got to town until our operation. I would have expected that someone with your credentials would have been able to afford something better: The Fleur d'Or, maybe? But maybe you thought this was lower-profile. At least it's clean and doesn't smell funny.

The desk attendant is sort of eying us. She doesn't recognize you — us — but that's a good thing, I think.

Discarded in one corner is Guidebook to Anglophone Atlantis.

There's a spiral staircase that leads up to the dormitory rooms.

> up
Dormitory Room
Painted off-white, with hard wood floors under many layers of protective gloss coating: there are no surfaces in this room that would take a stain. Four dorm beds are lined up against the wall.

The locker you identify as your own sits near one of the beds, still locked with its dial lock.

A girl of about 19 is standing in the middle of the room, looking around as though she can't quite believe where she landed or what she's doing here. She is carrying a heavy pack and wearing a pink t-shirt.

"Hey," says the girl. "Do you think this place is safe?" she asks conspiratorially.

I must look blank, because she goes on, "I saw this documentary once, right, about a serial killer who went from youth hostel to youth hostel, grooming girls and killing them. And then he'd chop up the bodies and put the body parts into the lockers. And no one would find out until he'd gone away again."

Nothing like that has happened around here, but she seems to get a charge out of scaring herself with this story.

It's curious, now you look at it: it's a combination lock with a dial face, but no one has bothered putting any numerals onto the dial.

Galley
You were going through the galley cupboards on the yacht. "If you're looking for coffee, Slango forgot to resupply," Brock said, descending the galley staircase in a wet Speedo.

"No, the first-letter razor," you replied, holding up a portable clock. "I need a lock that responds to restoration gel but nothing else."

"Ah." Brock toweled his hair. "It's in my bunk, sorry. Want to come look for it?"

You smiled — a give-away smile. "Wish I could, but we're on a deadline. Go put some pants on. And bring me the razor."

Then we're back in the present.

The backpacking girl is watching our every move with unconcealed curiosity, which makes me a little hesitant to do anything with the locker.

She is just the sort of tourist who most annoys the locals, but actually I find her type a little endearing: she may not be very sophisticated yet, but she wants to expand her horizons, and that's more than you can say for most of the friends she probably left back at home.

> show ear to girl


/.* After a moment to regain her composure, she flees the vicinity.

> turn dial
The dial turns smoothly — much too smoothly. There are no clicks, no tiny ticks of inward mechanisms working. By the feel of it, there might be no real locking device here at all.

Still no numbers on the dial. My mother had a wristwatch like that once. Always a nuisance.

"Hey, so, like," we begin, twirling our hair in one finger. "What if I, like, accidentally locked something in the locker upstairs and I don't know the number to get it open? It is, like, so important that I get my stuff back."

Her expression of dreamy good will hardens into one of cool contempt. "Lockers are the responsibility of the guests," she says. "You brought the lock, so you must know the combination."

The locker you identify as your own sits near one of the beds, still locked with its dial lock.

> put gel on dial
We dip out a pea-sized quantity of gel and rub it gently onto the lock. With an audible SPLORT, the lock becomes a clock and falls to the floor. It appears to be one of those archetypal alarm clocks that crows at sunrise and generally makes a nuisance of itself. It shows the time to be about half past nine.

Sis,

I'm keeping your wire transfer funds. I want to try for Stanford.

I'd say thank you except that, one, you didn't get it legally (I saw this documentary about teen prostitutes — if that's where it came from then EW) and, two, honestly? You owe for what you put us through after you ran away. Mom and Dad were humiliated that you turned into the prodigal daughter. Your face got on milk cartons. Pastor Hughes GAVE A SERMON ABOUT IT.

Mom spent all that time coaching you through spelling practice, you know she doesn't enjoy getting up at 4 AM, right? You totally threw that in their faces.

If you want to come home sometime, fine, but don't come to just see me. If you want to see me you have to see Mom and Dad too.

Nate.

The plans are rolled up and stuck shut with a label that reads "PROPERTY OF DENTAL CONSONANTS LIMITED — UNAUTHORIZED USE ILLEGAL". They're just a set of prints from the main computer design, of course, but still extremely informative: to the right engineer, they might reveal the secret of T-insertion for replication by other companies. These are what you and Brock were originally contracted to lift from the island, at a fee in the multiple millions.

Heritage Corner
This patch of the town square has been paved over in octagonal bricks and is commonly used for displays of traditional dancing: over-50 women in home-made embroidered aprons, skipping arm-in-arm and jumping over broomsticks.

No, there aren't any here now. But trust me. It's an unforgettable sight.

Under a bit of shelter in the corner, a diorama table shows scenes from local history, rotated out each week. This week's diorama represents the first sitting of the Committee for the New Orthodox Orthography.

The park continues to the north and west; to the east is the hostel.

> go to cinema
/We (have a (brief|short) walk|walk) among the crowds.

Cinema Lobby
This is a small, one-screen theater. The seats are not comfortable and the screen is not large. The projector is old. The management is lazy. No food is served.

On two occasions, the film I was watching burst into flames while it was being shown.

Despite these handicaps, it maintains an active and interested clientele simply by virtue of content: a wide variety of foreign films that, though meticulously dubbed into flawless California-accented English, nonetheless carry that slight tang of the forbidden.

Evidently the next showing is not for a little while yet, because there are no patrons in sight.

"Ticket," says the ticket-taker automatically.

> give ticket to ticket-taker
"Here, have a ticket," we say.

The ticket-taker frowns slightly as he takes the ticket. He turns it over front and back; looks at us in confusion; looks at the ticket again. Then he goes to the phone and makes a call.

I'm nervous. It's evident that he's talking to his manager. He doesn't take his eyes off us for a moment. He puts his hand over the mouth of the receiver so that we can't hear the whole conversation clearly, but the gist is still obvious: "...be fake... but... a TRICKET maybe? or, like, a STICKET? ...oh, all right."

Finally he hangs up.

"Sorry for the inconvenience," he says. "Your ticket looks a little different from our usual ones, but I guess the printing has been changed."

He tears the ticket briskly into confetti, destroying all evidence of our crime, and points off to the west. "The screening room is that way. Thank you and enjoy the show. It's not for a while, though."

> w

Screening Room
Whatever is scheduled for later showing has not started yet, and is probably not destined to start for some time; at any rate, the screen is blank and no audience has yet assembled.

My backpack is stowed under a seat in the third row from the back. I figured that it would be undisturbed there for a couple of hours, in the dark and out of sight, and if anyone found it they would probably turn it in to Lost and Found. But it is a big relief to find it still there.

/We (make the fair walk|have a healthy walk|walk) away from the crowds and the fair and over the top of the old walls.

Hesychius Street
As the street names make obvious, this part of town was laid out in a different political age, when it was considered more important to commemorate linguistic richness than to standardize practices.

This is also the edge of the richest part of town, with houses — really, almost villas — that were built for households with servants. My parents' place is just a block or two north of here.

On holidays like today, this street is often host to a farmer's market; though it is now late enough in the day that most of the farmers have given up and gone home, taking with them their twenty-three varieties of pickled olives, their loganberry jam, and their pigs'-feet-in-aspic.

One remaining farmer lazes here, watching his stall.

Webster Court
Hesychius Street opens here into a broad and plainly-paved court.

Lending its name to the location is a bronze statue of Noah Webster. My mother likes to irritate my father by quoting what his contemporaries called Webster: a "viper", a "maniacal pedant", and (always a favorite at Reform Day parties) "a toad in the service of sans-culottism". She makes sure to pronounce that in the most Parisian accent possible.

The large building just to the north — yes, the one in pale pink — is my parents' home. I think I mentioned that my parents were well off. My father works for the Bureau, embarrassingly, and my mother was born into the kind of money that we like to pretend doesn't exist on this island.

The streets continue south, east, and west; and just to the northeast is my parents' side garden.

Patriotic Chard-Garden
A narrow strip of land between the house and the edge of my parents' property. The eastern edge runs right up to the decaying old wall of the city, which here means some stumpy masonry on this side and a dizzying drop on the other.

The rest of their terraces and gardens are fenced off.

A little chard still grows in the nearest bed, carefully tended to thrive in this climate.

Because it's so linguistically productive, chard is something of a national symbol; and during the world wars, there was a fad of gardening at home. After the war, it became common for affluent people with a little bit of land to keep their garden, so that if you were down on your luck you could glean a few leaves.

> get chard
We pick the chard, leaving bare soil behind.

A flicker of curtains from inside the house suggests that someone saw us — a cleaner, possibly. But then there is a voice, not audible except as a confident rising and falling tone; this will be my mother, saying not to worry and not to interfere.

Crumbling Wall Face
The wall once continued north from here some distance before curving northwest around the remainder of the city. So much has crumbled away, though, that the walkway is impassable north of this point. To protect citizens, there is a safety railing across the broken edge.

A metal ladder of four rungs descends the inner face of the wall, allowing pedestrians access to the streets to the west.

Among the rubble fill of the wall is an odd spiral-shaped rock.

/We (take|get) the snap.

We slip between the houses and down a path that looks as though it might lead to someone's back yard. No one has ever put up signage to correct this misapprehension because no one who lives around here is eager to encourage strangers on the private beach.

Soon, however, the footpath begins to descend purposefully towards the level of the ocean.

We continue down until there is a chink of a view of the sea. Then the path descends through a few last hairpin twists among rocks, and comes out suddenly on a little beach.

Private Beach
This is little more than a strip of fine yellow sand, perhaps twenty meters from side to side, and five from the hillside to the waterline. A little sage grows on the hillside, escaped from some garden, along with wilder plants. Above, at the top of that slope, are houses with balconies overlooking the sea, but from this angle it's impossible to see much of them, or for them (you'll have to take my word on this) to see us.

Something green and plastic just barely pokes out of the sand.

The snap makes an, er, snapping noise.

The large, pale pink building north of us is my parents' home.

The streets continue south, east, and west; and just to the northeast is my parents' side garden.

The door to my parents' house opens and my father comes out. He's talking over his shoulder: "Sorry, dear, but someone has to be on call."

My mother answers from inside, but we can't make out what she's saying.

"Surge on the grid," Father replies. "Could be an unauthorized synthesizer, but more likely... yes, exactly. I'll try to be home before the fireworks."

He closes the door behind him.

Hastily I take off our monocle and palm it. Father shouldn't recognize us in our current body, but wearing expensive Bureau equipment in his presence would be a terrible idea.

We put the monocle into the backpack.

My father sees us from a distance and gives a neighborly wave. "Happy Punctuating!" he shouts.

I wave back rather weakly.

He gets on his small red scooter, checks his helmet, and revs off to the south. Off, apparently, to investigate the synthesizer that put us together. That will go slowly because of the holiday, but I'm guessing there will be Bureau investigators crawling all over the south side of old town in an hour or two.

/(We |We have a (brief|short|quick) |We make the( brief| short| quick)? |It's a( brief| short |quick)? )(walk|hike) out of the cocooning silence of the wealthy streets and back among the fair booths.

High Street
Hustle, bustle, dirt; ugly American chain shops; lots and lots of people. There seems to be a large organized protest in progress: protesters completely cram the sidewalk to the southeast.

The curb is lined with garbage.

To the west, the street turns into a monumental staircase leading to the old fortified area; a cross street heads southeast towards the main roundabout.

From a loudspeaker nearby comes the electronic sound of simulated bells ringing the hour after noon. It's later than I thought. We'd better get a move on.

The snapping continues.

> wave h-remover at chard
We reset the device to h. With a distinct whiff of crisp, snappy cardboard, the chard turns into a card. Not a playing card, as I might have expected, or a calling card, or even an index card, but a Tarot card, representing the Chariot. The vehicle is drawn by two prize horses, one black, one white. The driver appears to be having some difficulty keeping them together, to judge from the surly expression and the raised whip.

The snapping continues.

> wave d-remover at card
We reset the device to d. With a distinct whiff of metal parts and oil, the card turns into a car. It is little larger than a toy, but that is what you want when driving on the streets around here. Any substantial vehicle wouldn't fit down the winding drives.

Here is how my mother gets around. She takes a 300 Euro Hermès scarf with an orange border and a pattern of prancing horses. She tosses it in the air. As it falls, she shoots it twice, like a clay pigeon: once to take out the F, the second time for the S. And such a car: buttery leather seats, jaguar lines. If someone asks how she gets such good results, she jokes that it's because of her quality materials.

Suffice it to say that we are not similarly blessed.

The car is far too large for us to carry, and falls onto the ground.

/We reset the device to b. There is a [a-z \-]+, and the garbage turns into a garage. It is a small but well-furnished garage for minor tuneups and repairs.

The mechanic nods at us.

The snapping continues.

"Will this work?" We hold out the oil.

"Should do," he says. Rolling up his sleeves, he goes to work on the car. There is no small amount of banging and muttering, but finally he stands back and announces that he believes it is now in working condition.

Fish Market
Not very fishy at the moment, in fact: all the real trade happens in the early morning; then there is a period of tourist trade when the seafood sale tails off and most of the purchases are of polished conch shells and starfish; and then a little after noon the area clears out completely, leaving only briny rivulets on the concrete.

A tall, stern woman is standing in the middle of the market. She wears the black caped uniform of an Authenticator, and a monocle just like mine. And I don't think I want her to see us.

Just east of here is a rusting corrugated tin building, which was built to house various possessions of the fishermen.

[Your score has gone up by five points and is now twenty-six.]

> e
While the Authenticator's back is turned, we slip inside...

Tin Hut
Most of the light in here comes from circular windows punched into the tin walls just under the ceiling. From the inside, the building looks both larger and more sound than it appears from outside: there are plenty of sturdy struts supporting the roof and keeping the walls upright.

Various tarpaulin-covered masses fill the room.

A trap door is set in the floor.

Sometimes smugglers and forgers have been known to stash things in here, since the building is close to the docks but rarely attracts the interest of customs officials.

I don't think there's anything showing that should get us into trouble. Timidly we open the door; the Authenticator has her back to us. We slip out. She makes one more turn in place — monocled gaze sliding across us without stopping — and then she strides away to the north.

Counterfeit Monkey
It takes a minute for us to adjust to the light in here. Built when people were a bit shorter and ceilings were a bit lower, the Counterfeit Monkey is always smoky and never well lit, even in the middle of the day.

...and... Slango is not here.

This is bad. Even I can see this is bad. What happened to your confidence in your team? Where are the guys who are supposed to get us out of here?

Something must have gone wrong.

Outdoor Café
From this slightly raised terrace, tourists have a view of the activity in the market and out over the docks.

Curiously, there's an acquaintance of yours here: Nexami Engeo is at one of the round black metal tables. He's a musician, the front man of engeo. Your gang helped him out with some customs issues because of his unusual name.

Nexami nods to us. "Watch out. That table next to you has something sticky spilled on it." And indeed there is a spill. You were about to lean on it nonchalantly.

"Nice clean-up method," Nexami Engeo comments. "Beats using a rag." At least, I think that's what he said.

The snapping continues.

He stands up and mutters something. I have a little trouble with his Scottish accent — we don't get a lot of that around here, for obvious reasons — but you interpret it as him saying he'd better go pay up.

Counterfeit Monkey
Infamously this pub was raided in 1929, the year that the Bureau developed its first meager attempt at an Authentication Scope, and dozens of smugglers and fraudulent businessmen went to jail. But neither that raid nor subsequent scrutiny has ever shut the place down entirely. Built when people were a bit shorter and ceilings were a bit lower, the Counterfeit Monkey is always smoky and never well lit, even in the middle of the day.

Parker acknowledges our return with a nod.

"I wonder whether you've seen an associate of mine," we say to Parker. "Name of Slango."

Parker looks over the bar at us. "He comes in here from time to time," he says. "Very regular customer. Always has about three rum and cokes."

This is a lie, and therefore a test. Slango doesn't drink alcohol himself and doesn't permit drunkenness in his crew.

The snapping continues.

/(We could|I'd like to|We want to|I'm inclined to|My response would be to) challenge Parker about the rum.

"Must be a different Slango," we say. "Mine is more of a root beer man. Thanks anyway though."

"Oh, that Slango," Parker says. "He's been around town the last couple of days, but not today. If you know his lady friend, you might try her."

Lady friend? This can only mean Lena, she being the only female native with whom Slango spends much time socially. But you wouldn't have guessed that she'd advanced to the status of lady friend. Either way, Lena is a rather odd woman who keeps a used bookstore off Deep Street.

The snapping continues.

"Well now," he says, grinning, "that would surely be illegal, would it not? Origin Paste is after all a controlled substance in this country, due to its unhappy association with fraudulent activities. On the other hand there is no law against someone winning the Origin Paste in a completely legitimate game of chance or skill."

"Explain this game as though I have no idea what you're talking about," you say, leaning on the bar in an interested fashion. Are you flirting with Parker? No? Okay. Good to know.

"It's a designated challenge game," says Parker. You've seen this played before, but he explains the rules anyway.

"There are two contestants, one challenger and one defender.

"The challenger chooses any object he likes and shows it to the moderator ahead of time.

"The defender, without seeing the object, stipulates a general category. The challenger has five minutes to turn his designated object into an item that fits the defender's category, or he forfeits his ante."

"Right," says the barman. "The sill it is."

He turns towards the group assembled around the dartboard. "Anyone want to defend against this character?" (with a nod at you).

"Something smaller than a pebble!" suggests a woman in the front row. She passes forward her own ante to the bar, and the game is on.

This produces a squawk of surprise and irritation from the defendant, and you get the impression that this game has been agreeably fleecing tourists all day. Pity you had to come along and spoil it.

Aquarium Bookstore
The shop takes its name from the collection of fish mounted on every wall: swordfish, bass, other things I don't recognize. Underneath these dubious tokens, the walls are covered with bookshelves, and there are stacks of books on the floor where the shelves have proven insufficient.

The merchandise consists mainly, but not exclusively, of books, and the selection caters to odd tastes. You once picked up in here a book about a man who R-removed a wrench, and then had his way with it. You and Brock had a good time with that one for the next month and a half.

Lena is present, all right. In fact she watches us keenly the instant we come into the shop. Lena is an associate of Slango's. You hadn't realized that had crossed over into a romance. Slango has never, ever in your recollection dated anyone. And now this.

"Happy Serial Comma Day," she says.

"Glad to see you've got plenty of Origin Paste," Lena remarks. "It's such a useful thing to have. Smells so nice."

"I don't know what you're talking about," she says. "But since you're here, whoever you are, I wonder whether you'd like to have a look at some merchandise of mine that could use a spruce."

Aha. She wants us to prove our identity; probably has contraband that needs concealing, and wants us to do the deed as proof of trustworthiness.

/(There's a brief pause.)?

/(There's a brief pause. )?Lena goes off into a corner and rummages among the suspicious piles of books, and uncovers a box. "C'mere," she says; and obediently I wander over to that area of the store, which incidentally happens to be tucked away and half-hidden by shelves.

"See here," she says. "See what you can do with it, eh?"

The snapping continues.


> x contraband
It's just a cardboard box in which some items of interest have been stored.

In the contraband box are some modems and some preamps.

Lena apparently wants our help getting them into a less identifiable format.

> wave m-remover at modems
We reset the device to m. With a distinct whiff of old book, the modems turn into some odes. A slender volume of poetry, bound between red covers. It looks completely harmless and is written in English.

The blurb on the back describes it as a "collection of meditations" on Atlantis' imaginary roots, which is to say, a lot of stuff about magic-wielding Phoenicians, Knights Templar, refugees from the Tower of Babel, space aliens, cabalistic mysticism, and Lully's combinatorics.

It fits in perfectly with the rest of Lena's selection. Really amazing work. I've seen other people who were able to do impressive things with local field distortions — think hard enough and you can prejudice the outcome of a linguistic transition.

But this... this is detail work like I haven't seen. My hat is off.

Or would be if I were wearing a hat and taking it off didn't mean making you take it off too.

Lena touches the binding appreciatively. "You've even got that little bit of creasing in the spine that makes it look used," she says. "This is perfect. Only risk is customers wanting to buy it. I've got a couple this would be right up their alley."

The snapping continues.

> wave s-remover at odes
We reset the device to s. With a distinct whiff of paper, the odes turn into an ode. A short poem, letter-pressed attractively on a sheet of thick paper. It is entitled "Our Ancestors, The Immortal Spirits of the Pyramids," a fact which disinclines me to study the rest.

"Well, it's portable, and it doesn't look like much, but then again, it doesn't look like much. I mean, I could easily lose it, couldn't I? Just one sheet. And if someone were to ask me why I was carrying it around that would be a little hard to explain. It's not like it's a whole book of 'em, is it?"

"That would be extremely helpful," we say. Perhaps we can finally get off this island and back into our separate skins, which would not be one minute too soon for me.

/"Very good," she says. She goes over to one of the free-standing shelves and takes out copies of .*. Behind these works of literature she finds what looks like a cellular phone; but it mustn't be one, or at least not of the usual variety, because the Bureau tightly controls such items.

We hear half a conversation. "It's me. There's someone to see... yes, I had her do the contraband... I don't know, a little taller and a lot less mean... Oh! I see. She looks healthy enough... I'm not running a restaurant! Okay. Okay. I'll talk to you later, sweetie. Bye."

Without meeting our eye, she buries the phone back in its previous location. Then she says, "He's coming in direct. He says go over to Counterfeit Monkey and he'll be right over as originally planned, and he's sorry about the wait."

"Oh! And." She tosses us a coin. "Have a drink on me."

Built when people were a bit shorter and ceilings were a bit lower, the Counterfeit Monkey is always smoky and never well lit, even in the middle of the day.

Slango sits at a dark table, nursing a root beer. Slango is, of course, not Slango's real name. He is half criminal, half ideological revolutionary: uncouth, restless, always hungry for a new exploit. Had he been born into a freer society, he might have become a very valuable engineer or consultant. He has been your mentor in crime and your usher into the world of adults.

Slango meets our eye for a long minute without smiling.

"Slango," you say. "Lena gave me a totally unwanted visual about your yaklike proportions. Guess you also got a yak's sense of clock time?"

"It was an emergency. I figured you'd go to Lena, and I was right."

"You were lucky. I knew her a little, but I had no idea you two were making the yak with two humps."

"No such thing as a bactrian yak," Slango replies. "My apologies. I assumed that what Brock knows, he passes on to you, and he certainly knows about me and Lena." He scowls into his root beer. "Nearly gave himself a hernia laughing," Slango adds under his breath.

"She's thirty-two," says Slango crisply. "She runs Radio Free Atlantida single-handed with electronics she built herself. And if she were old enough to be my spinster aunt, that would still be my business."

"So, uh, I guess you guys are pretty serious, then," you say.

Or maybe he's saying that to the me half of us. Right now, it's true that I'm not keen on the prospect of hanging out in Atlantis. We're already way behind the plan.

The snapping continues.

Sorry, but I have to get this out there. "I was really expecting a smoother escape plan when I arranged to work with your operation," I say.

Slango eyes us with disfavor. "Andra, you got a moron up in your head. Kid — Alex — we aren't travel agents."



"I've got to get back to the yacht; it's empty," Slango says. "And I would prefer not to let the Bureau get a good look at me, while your current face is, shall we say, disposable. The trick is, we don't know where Brock is. If he left a message for us, it'll be at the dead drop."

That's a spot at the public convenience by the town bus station where the three of you leave messages for one another when necessary. Usually quiet, yet anonymous. "We're on it," we say.

"Glad to hear it," says Slango. "Now stop referring to yourself as 'we' in company."

The snapping continues.

This gives us something to go on, anyway. We give Slango what I intend as a reassuring nod of solidarity.

"Back to the yacht for me," Slango says. "Don't let the other half of your head do anything you wouldn't do."

"Which of us are you talking to?" I ask smartly.

"Both."

He heads out towards the docks and quickly disappears from view — returning to the yacht to wait for us to arrive with Brock.

Counterfeit Monkey
Built when people were a bit shorter and ceilings were a bit lower, the Counterfeit Monkey is always smoky and never well lit, even in the middle of the day.

The clientele are currently engaged in a game of darts, while the barman watches and practices a sarcastic wit on those who embarrass themselves.

Docks
Here are some dozens of boats tied up: some of them are small to medium-sized fishing craft, some tourist boats for trips around the island, some merely ferries to the deeper harbor where the cruise ships anchor.

To the east, up a moderate rise from the sea-level docks, is the imposing exterior of the Customs House. The classical look is only a little undermined by the public-service posters along the front. There passports are inspected and cargo passed under authentication, foreign items renamed or confiscated, and suspected smugglers interrogated.

Immediately west, the Counterfeit Monkey's sign sways in the wind.

The whole Roundabout has ground to a halt, with protesters walking in the street and in some places completely filling the road. But this is mostly a nuisance until I notice that there are a couple of teenagers handcuffed to a tree.

I give the wheel a yank and run the car up onto the central traffic circle a little way. Call it a parking job. We need to get those kids out of here before their arrest is processed and they go to storage. I might not have the nerve to do anything by myself, but you're with me, and I'm starting to appreciate that's like being Batman.


Traffic Circle (jammed into the car)
Normally no pedestrian ever comes to this circle of grass and litter: the flow of traffic is too constant and too fast. But the protest has stopped the traffic and I'm determined to do something about the two teenagers I saw just now, so here we are. Though we probably have to get out of the car if we're going to be useful.

Traffic Circle
A giant Atlantida statue stands at the center, decorated in an unorthodox fashion with a sign and a stuffed octopus. Atlantida is to us a bit as Uncle Sam might be to you, except that she embodies the spirit of the people rather than the government. In recent years she's become a symbol of opposition to the Bureau.

"Go ahead, put us in Cold Storage!" shouts the defiant teenager. "I'm happy to sleep through all this shit and wake up when we have jet packs and a government that respects the rights of its people."

The All-Purpose Officer shifts the restoration gel rifle from one hand to another; looks around; and then props it against the foot of the statue.

Time passes.

The nervous teenager looks unhappy. "We won't get out of here until our families are all dead and global warming has reduced Atlantis to three square feet of hilltop."

The All-Purpose Officer goes around to the back of the statue and begins to climb up the leg, finding footholds in the folds of Atlantida's gown. It looks like a precarious business, but he's determined.

Gritting his teeth, the All-Purpose Officer climbs for access out onto Atlantida's huge metal arm. It looks about as sturdy as a substantial tree branch, but more slippery, and inconveniently angled.

The snapping continues.

> shoot tree
(with the restoration gel rifle)
We shoot the restoration gel rifle at the brown tree. With an audible SPLORT, the brown tree becomes a brown tee. It's a brown wooden peg for putting a golf ball on. Apparently the All-Purpose Officer performed a little light R-insertion when he found himself in need of a portable tree.

Freed from attachment to the tree, the teenagers look at each other and then run off into the crowd.

The All-Purpose Officer glances around, but you've made us stand so our body conceals the rifle from his angle. He growls in annoyance. "Station," he says, apparently to thin air. "I need back-up."

Understood, says a tinny distant voice.

Once the All-Purpose Officer comes level with the sign, he shoots it with the diminutive affixer, turning it into a signet. It's an outsized signet bearing the crest of the Bureau of Orthography, now hanging around the statue's neck in the same way that the sign did a moment ago.

The snapping continues.

We prop the rifle back at the foot of the statue.

The crowd is parting. We might be able to leave soon.

Laboriously and with obvious irritation, the All-Purpose Officer pries the arms of the stuffed octopus off the statue's wrist, where they appear to have been fixed with glue.

The snapping continues.

No one seems to be much the wiser about what just happened. I have to say, you know what you're doing. Traffic is starting to move again. We'd better get on to the dead drop.

Roundabout (jammed into the car)
We are jammed into the car with our knees almost at our chin, looking out through the bulbous little windshield.

The traffic flows in a tight circle around a statue which we know all too well.

Confusing signs point in various directions: northeast to Deep Street, northwest to High Street, south to Long Street, east to Tall Street.

There are just the two toilet stalls and a couple of sinks, but the place has been kept up reasonably well, if one doesn't count the graffiti.

A soap dispenser hangs beside the mirror.

About knee-height in one of the stalls is a hole that runs right through the wall between the men's and women's restrooms. It's here that you and Brock and Slango usually leave things for one another.

Echoing space, marble floor, eye-like skylight many meters above us: so far, the Rotunda might belong to any 19th-century government bureau of means and self-importance.

What sets this one apart is the lettering, each sigil no bigger than a flea, carved over every inch of the walls. Inscribed here is, in fact, the entire text of A New Orthodox Orthography, which means that if we had a great deal of patience and many rolls of butcher paper, we could take rubbings and wind up with our very own volume.

We don't, of course. There are better things to do. More important places to go. The administrative part of the bureau is away to the south, and there is an exhibit of letter tools to the east, which is open to the public.

Arbot Maps & Antiques
There is a large collection of vintage and antique maps under glass — the island of Atlantis as a whole, street maps of here and of Maiana, navigation maps of the harbor, and then maps of more distant places as well.

A stylish mannequin near the front sports a pair of Britishizing goggles.

Overseeing all this is a woman named Kate.

"Welcome to Arbot," says Kate. "Feel free to browse and ask me any questions you may have about the merchandise."

"That just came in today," Kate says. "We bought it from a visiting scholar — he'd come to attend a demonstration with my boss, as a matter of fact, and happened to have this item with him."

She looks at the map dubiously for a moment. "Just between us, I've never heard of Slangovia. But as the seller was a guest of my employer, it seemed rude to quibble. And it is a very attractively drawn piece. I'm sure you'll enjoy it."

Fleur d'Or Drinks Club
The back wall is dramatically decorated with bottled liquors of all sorts, from gin to cachaça; there's a giant bottle of Campari, taller than your average three-year-old, with a red ribbon around its neck.

What makes this place technically a drinks club rather than a bar is its license to serve letter-manufactured food and drink. A toolkit on the bar contains some screwdrivers, some gimlets, and some rusty nails, ready to be transformed into their respective cocktails.



The bartender is in the middle of showing her homonym paddle to a patron holding a gin and tonic. The other patrons are scattered around the room at small tables, drinking or talking among themselves.

She acknowledges us with a nod as we stroll up to the bar and get close enough to hear their conversation. "It was originally produced as a toy, but it's actually a bit dangerous," the bartender is saying.

"Dangerous? How so?" asks the patron.

"Various ways," she says. "Suppose I hit a small object that has a big homonym, like say a plane. You know, the carpentry kind. Suddenly I've got an airplane-style plane on top of me."

The snapping continues.

"This?" she says, looking a little surprised. "You want it converted?"

"Why not?"

"No reason," she says. "Just I did the same item a few hours ago for a gentleman. Really hot, with these amazing eyes-"

"Whatever," you say, before she can get any more excited about Brock.

She smirks. Then she taps the legend with her paddle and it transforms into a proper map legend.

"What if you hit something that doesn't mean anything else?" the patron asks. "Like a chicken?"

"Nothing," she says. "That's safe." As though to demonstrate, she smacks the paddle against her left buttock. "See? I don't get changed into a different bartender. Want to try?"

She holds up the paddle as though she's going to tap him with it.

"Uh... my name is Mark," he says.

"Maybe not, then!" she says, laughing brightly.

This legend has been edited from its original form, replacing the words like HOSPITAL and RESTROOM with other, hand-written labels: INVITE, GOT, 11, OUT, T-INSERTER, etc. By arranging the words of the legend in the order in which the icons appear along the main street, we arrive at GOT INVITE T-INSERTER DEMONSTRATION. OUT 11 AM.

Of course, it's already long past 11 AM, so Brock's plan clearly went wrong. If we're going to go after him, we'll have to go to the T-inserter demonstration ourselves. The catch is that, as dangerous new technology, it's held inside the Bureau and requires a special invitation to enter.

I think I know where we can get one, though. My advisor Professor Waterstone — that's the person overseeing my graduate research — was also invited to this demonstration. We might be able to get his.

"Halt! You! Young person!"

It's my neighbor, Mrs. Parsnip, leaning out from her apartment above us. Mrs. Parsnip and I don't interact except about once a month when she comes around to ask for my spare change for bus fare or the laundry.

"Clear off or I'll call the police!" she shouts.

...No, don't worry, I'll handle this.

I step us back and stare up at her. "I'm a friend of Alex," I say. "He called and asked me to stop by because he thought he left the stove on. Said he climbs in the window all the time when he gets locked out."

"That's true," she says. "Shouldn't be allowed out by himself. Okay, go ahead."

In a mutter she adds, "Not like he has anything worth stealing anyway." She vanishes from view.

We're about to, when the door to the street opens and my mother walks into the room. She shuts it behind her and puts away her key before she notices us. Then she stands very still. For about a quarter second she considers calling the police, but I can see that worry passing away again as she takes in our clothing, age, and general demeanor.

"Hi there," she says, coming forward to take our hand. "I'm Mrs. Rosehip. Alex Rosehip's mother. You must be a friend of his?"

I know you think it's a bit sketchy that my mother just walks into my apartment when I'm not around, but I swear to you she's never done that before. She must be more worried about something than she's letting on.

I didn't think she'd noticed.

"I think it's graduate school getting to him a bit," we lie. I am pretty sure this is what my mother thinks: she has little time for whining or sulking, and I believe she considers any ideological queasiness I may have exhibited to be just malingering about research that is not going well.

"Really?" she says. "Hm."

I would like her to go on, but she doesn't: because it would be indiscreet, because she doesn't trust us.



"Well," Mother says. "I had better go. If you do see Alex, tell him to call me, please. It isn't an emergency, but you can tell him there's a bit of Bureau business I'd like to discuss with him."

We nod, and suddenly it is borne in on me that this may be the last I see of my mother in a lifetime: and I'm trying to memorize the exact cut of her hair and the way her expensive Italian heels tap on the floor, and meanwhile she is going out completely indifferent to the moment. I could have stood for our previous meeting to be the last one — we had dinner and she hugged me goodbye then. This makes it all much much worse.

And you, you're nattering at me in our head, asking what she meant about the Bureau. It might be, I guess, that they've been watching me and that she got wind of it. That would be likely. But if so it doesn't matter, not any more.

She sets down the sign in order to free her hands for more expressive argument. "Listen, we're trying to gain financial support to make a major advertising campaign pushing the concept of toxi waste throughout the anglophone world.

Samuel Johnson Hall
This is the main building for Language Studies. This is not to be confused with Language Engineering, which is the department that handles devices for the manipulation of language-objects; it is also not to be confused with Linguistics, English Literature, or Comparative Literature, all of which have their own buildings and faculties. Language Studies applies itself to questions of linguistic efficacy chiefly at a social and anthropological level.

That's to say that we study how the ability to change things based on their names affects daily life and society.

The department office, with several professorial offices leading off of it, is to the southeast. To the southwest is the seminar room, where many of the upper-level courses occur, and which also contains the department library; downstairs is the basement, where the graduate students and junior instructors are kept.

On the wall hangs a framed photograph of Professor Waterstone, with the words SHAPLY CHAIR in big letters underneath.

This corner office was won in a battle of wills with several other departments during the most recent rebuilding drive. Professor Waterstone is fond of reminding the others that he was the one to obtain this favorable position whenever there is a disagreement about procedure.

Waterstone's Office
A very finicky, neatly arranged room, in which one never feels quite at home.

Professor Waterstone is sitting here. Waterstone is my dissertation advisor. (He insists on the "o" spelling.) He's an expert in the history of linguistic and orthographical power, but he's politically kind of reactionary. "Don't meddle" is pretty much his motto.

We can see an invitation on a desk. It's from Dental Consonants Limited. Their design of stationery is unmistakable.

In front of Professor Waterstone is a small laptop.

He looks up at us gravely. "I don't believe we've met," he says. "Can I help you?"

The snapping continues.

/(We could|I'd like to|We want to|I'm inclined to|My response would be to) make up some excuse, ask whether he met the activists, or ask why he is working on Serial Comma Day.

> ask why
"Why are you in today?" we ask. "Isn't it a holiday?"

"The pursuit of knowledge does not occur according to the calendar," he says. Then he adds, "And my wife is having the carpets shampooed and kicked me out of the house."

The snapping continues.

/(We could|I'd like to|We want to|I'm inclined to|My response would be to) ask whether he met the activists.

> ask whether
"Did you run into those activists outside?"

"Sadly, it is our misfortune constantly to encounter people with no concept of what language manipulation can and cannot do," Waterstone says. He really seems to be in a bad mood today, even for him: maybe a fight with the wife, or a nasty letter from the dean.

There's a brief pause.

"Look, I really must work on this," says Waterstone, chasing us to the door. "Perhaps someone else in the department can answer a few of your questions. I believe I saw Professor Higgate earlier, and Professor Brown is usually in his lab downstairs. I'm sure he's not working on anything too urgent. Goodbye!"

The office door closes with measured firmness behind us.

Through the window in Waterstone's door, we can see him turning the lock. When he catches us watching he gives a tight, unfriendly smile and goes back to his desk.

A moment later the printer whirs thoughtfully.

The department printer sits on the u-shaped desk.

The networked printer handles output for all the computers in the department. The indicator lights glow red to indicate that the paper-drawer is empty. An additional light indicates that some document is in the queue to print and is waiting for the printer to be ready.

The printer is currently switched on.

The paper drawer is closed.

There is nothing on the output tray.

Graduate Student Office
A small windowless room divided into cubicles for individual graduate students.

A tiny refrigerator stores lunches (sometimes) and looted leftovers from department receptions (when available). On top of the fridge there is a coffee-maker.

My cubicle is the one with the swivel-chair, towards the back of the room by the water cooler. I cleared everything subversive out of there ages ago, and now I do most of my work at home in the apartment. It's safer that way.

We can see a sticky on the swivel-chair. I half recognize the handwriting, but I'm having trouble placing it. One of the other grad students, but I'm not sure which.

/We (take|get|pick up|acquire) the draft document. It's fifteen pages double-spaced, and appears to be the draft of a talk Professor Waterstone is preparing to give at a convention. I immediately notice, however, that several portions of the speech are marked with angry triple asterisks — Waterstone's way of marking up parts of text that need serious revision.

The talk concerns "homonym shame": the anxiety felt in the Victorian era, and still manifested at times in modern culture, about objects that shared the same name as (and therefore theoretically might be converted into) something rude. Methods of disguising the legs of pianos and crotches of trees occupy a good portion of Waterstone's exposition, and there is a page-long aside on methods of making sure that donkeys are known by that name and not by the alternative.

To judge, however, from the angry asterisking, Waterstone is still looking for at least one more example of an object susceptible to double-entendre that has been successfully rendered innocent by some linguistic modification.

Higgate's office
Higgate got about 30% finished with a stylish decorating scheme and then got distracted, leaving everything in a unsettled state. A few of her books are arranged on a very nice rosewood bookshelf, which looks Asian and is ornamented with small figurines; all the rest of her library is stacked higgledy-piggledy in plastic cartons.

Professor Higgate is sitting at an oval table, on which are spread an ugly yellow book, a sugar bowl, a teapot, and a romance novel in some heavily accented language. Higgate is the second reader on my dissertation committee, and a conlang expert — that is, Constructed Languages. It was a seminar with her that really got me thinking about utopian linguistics, and she's been very supportive, though cautious. She and Professor Waterstone don't always get along that well.

She looks up when we come in. ".i xu do se bangu la lojban." Higgate asks. She's asking whether we speak Lojban. For the present, I think it will raise fewer questions if we say no.

The snapping continues.

> no
"I'm afraid I don't understand," we say, smiling faintly.

Her face falls. "Ah! I was hoping you'd be here for Conversational Lojban Tea." The room is conspicuously lacking other Lojban conversationalists.

The snapping continues.

/(We could|I'd like to|We want to|I'm inclined to|My response would be to) ask how Professor Higgate is doing.

> ask how
"How are you?" we ask.

Forgive me these irrelevant questions, but I haven't seen Professor Higgate for a few days, and she's one of my favorite people in the department. I worry about her a little.

She looks taken aback, as though trying to figure out whether she knows us. Then she shrugs this off and decides to proceed as though she does.

"Oh, you know," she says. "It's that time of year when the energy's run out and the students have to be prodded with an electric rod to get them to do any work. And then I've got this book I've got to write, and Professor Waterstone keeps talking about how next year he would like to take a break from being Director of Graduate Studies..."

The snapping continues.

/(We could|I'd like to|We want to|I'm inclined to|My response would be to) ask what would be so bad about directing graduate studies.

> ask what
"What would be so bad about being director of graduate studies?" I ask, a little surprised. I always thought she liked graduate students.

The snapping continues.

"Nothing, nothing! It's just that I have this book I should be writing, and Professor Waterstone has done the job for so many years that he's—"

She pulls up short, apparently remembering that she doesn't, actually, know us at all. "He's very experienced, and I am not sure he would enjoy watching someone else do it differently," she concludes tactfully. "Our personal styles are not very similar."

There's a brief pause.

"I'd offer you some cucumber sandwiches," Professor Higgate says. "But I'm afraid I ate them all."

/(We could|I'd like to|We want to|I'm inclined to|My response would be to) ask whether she might let us into the language studies seminar room, ask how we might return a book, or ask which conlangs she knows.

> ask about seminar
"Could you possibly let me into the Language Studies Seminar Room?" we ask. "There's something I'd like to do in there."

"Er... Do you have some student ID or something? You see, and this is a little embarrassing, I'm afraid I'm not quite placing you at the moment, and I'm not supposed to allow students into that room unless they have some affiliation with the department."

Of course we don't have any ID, and no prospect of getting any. But she might be persuaded by some other evidence of affiliation.

The snapping continues.

/(We could|I'd like to|We want to|I'm inclined to|My response would be to) ask how we might return a book or ask which conlangs she knows.

> t book
"I need to return this book to the department library," we say, holding out The Problem of Adjectives.

The snapping continues.

"Oh! Yes, all right," she says. "Did you like it? It's a good overview of the subject, didn't you think? I'm afraid the author once annoyed Professor Waterstone at a conference, or we might have had her around to speak at one of our colloquia..."

Higgate stands, patting herself down as though worried she has forgotten something.

"After you," says Higgate. "I assume it's safe to leave for a minute; if anyone is coming for Lojban Tea we'll see them in the hall." She walks past us through the office door.

We walk a little behind Higgate, who has a very long businesslike stride despite her heels.

She fiddles with her keys for a moment before finding the right one. "Here you go," she says, pushing the door open.

Language Studies Seminar Room
They recently redid this room, and whoever picked the decorations had postmodern tastes.

The big table at the center of the room is an irregular polygon, with one chair pushed up to the shortest side.

The sound of discussion comes from down the hall: two voices speaking in Lojban, and then a male voice interrupting. "Do you have a license for this conversation?" it asks.

"Excuse me," Higgate says. "I'd better go see to that."

She waves and heads back northeast.

> go to brown's lab
/(We( make the| have a)?|It's a)( short| brief| quick)? walk|hike.

Brown's Lab
Professor Brown, the Reification of Abstracts researcher, is hunched over his work table. Brown is only barely a professor at all — actually, his working title is Senior Lecturer, and he holds a yearly contract which the University has the option to renew at whim. This prevents him going elsewhere while ensuring that he never has a fully-funded lab of his own. All the electrical equipment down here is tinker-toys compared to the stuff he really wants; in fact, half of it he built himself with components he bought with his own money.

I know all this because Brown cornered me in the hallway one afternoon and talked to me for twenty minutes straight about the pressures of academic job-hunting in the current political climate. I tried to get him to stop, but he's like a wind-up toy.

"Don't touch anything, please," he says, without looking up.

The snapping continues.

/(We could|I'd like to|We want to|I'm inclined to|My response would be to) ask what he is doing.

> ask what
"What are you up to there?" we ask. Asking Brown questions when he's working is a bit of a crap-shoot, I tell you now.

He wiggles his nose back and forth. I knew him for three months before I figured out what the wiggle is: it is his hands-free way of working his spectacles back up his nose when they start to slide down.

Without looking at us, he says, "I'm getting ready to do a new calibration run on 'love'."

This is a favorite of his, because you can get it so easily from a glove, so the materials are inexpensive.

The snapping continues.

/(We could|I'd like to|We want to|I'm inclined to|My response would be to) ask what love looks like or ask how Professor Brown makes abstracts.

> ask what
"What does love look like, then?" we ask, as though I hadn't seen this a bunch of times already.

"It varies," Professor Brown replies. "The manifestation of a complex concept depends on a variety of circumstances; by default if multiple concepts are available, the letter tool will produce whichever concept requires least energy to produce, but in cases where several concepts are indistinguishably popular, the results are apparently random.

"Recent research suggests that the outcome can be influenced by the language community surrounding the operation and even by the intention of the tool's user (to a limited degree); but I am not interested in pursuing those angles at present."

There: Professor Brown in a nutshell. Did he tell you anything you wanted to know? No.

The deal is that manifestations of "love" tend to look like stuff you'd find on a greeting card: roses, hearts, kiss symbols. Every once in a while you get something a little more platonic. But it's a let-down, if you want to know the truth. Most significant abstracts are like that: all you get by reifying them is a popular visualization.

The snapping continues.

/(We could|I'd like to|We want to|I'm inclined to|My response would be to) ask how Professor Brown makes abstracts.

> ask how
"What equipment do you use to make your abstracts?" we ask.

"It's an ordinary letter-remover with a few adjustments," Brown says. "The department's computer can lift some of the legal overrides on standard letter tools. The job would be easier if I had access to higher-powered machinery, but..."

The snapping continues.

/(We could|I'd like to|We want to|I'm inclined to|My response would be to) ask whether he can fix the letter-remover.

> ask whether
"Could you fix my letter-remover to make abstract objects as well?"

"It's not difficult, you just— oh, stay here, I'm not supposed to bring students into the rectification room."

He takes the letter-remover and steps out into the hallway. I can hear him using his keycard on the door, going into the little room west of the hallway, doing something there. (Don't bother thinking we're going to cosh him and take the keycard. I'm sure there's a better way, and I don't cosh people.)

He comes back in a minute.

"There," he says. "Should be abstract-enabled now."

The snapping continues.

/(We could|I'd like to|We want to|I'm inclined to|My response would be to) ask what he thinks of the letter-remover or thank Professor Brown.

[Your score has gone up by three points and is now fifty-three.]

> ask what
"Is there anything else that could be done to upgrade my letter-remover?" we ask naively.

"Nothing I can help you with, I'm afraid," he says. "There are some safety overrides that could be programmed out, allowing you to make living creatures, but that's..." He does his spasmodic shrug. "One of those things where I think the laws have a point. It's dangerous and possibly even cruel."

The snapping continues.

/(We could|I'd like to|We want to|I'm inclined to|My response would be to) ask why reifying living creatures is cruel or thank Professor Brown.

> ask why
"Why would it be cruel to make a living creature?" you ask.

"We don't know whether such creations have awareness and sensation like other creatures," he says. "If they do, it is horrible to bring them into existence only to send them out again."

Fleur d'Or Lobby
The Fleur d'Or is a high-end hotel that serves businessmen and luxury tourists interested in the linguistic mechanisms of the island. As a result, it has all kinds of paid exemptions, including an exemption allowing it to operate under a foreign name.

Fleur d'Or Drinks Club
The back wall is dramatically decorated with bottled liquors of all sorts, from gin to cachaça; there's a giant bottle of Campari, taller than your average three-year-old, with a red ribbon around its neck.

What makes this place technically a drinks club rather than a bar is its license to serve letter-manufactured food and drink. A toolkit on the bar contains some screwdrivers, some gimlets, and some rusty nails, ready to be transformed into their respective cocktails.

The stairs up are here; the lecture room at the east. Immediately south is the Graduate Student Office, and southwest is Professor Brown's office. The most interesting of all is the small door west, trying to look inconspicuous, but locked with a keycard lock: it's where the department stores its most dangerous licensed equipment.

Rectification Room
This is where equipment is brought for a tune-up, or to have its legal limits reinstalled (or, on rare occasions, removed). Access to these abilities is tightly controlled by the Bureau.

The reclamation machine stands near the door, ready to improve forbidden objects for the use of registered departmental users. It's very ordinary looking, a simple machine with leads able to attach to various linguistic equipment, and to read and rewrite the programming.

Lecture Hall (at the podium)
The main lecture hall used for large survey courses in language studies offered to undergraduates. I sat through courses here when I was an undergraduate myself, and have now delivered a few lectures as a teaching assistant.

The room extends south, full of hard wooden seats. Abandoned on one near the back is a coat.

A poster at the front of the room announces a conference on cultural reactions to linguistic change. It is being held in Nice the day after tomorrow, with Professor Waterstone as keynote speaker, on the topic of "homonym shame". Somehow I had forgotten about the date of this: I've been too much worried about our escape.

Lecture Hall (among the seats)
Many are the fine hours I have spent here dozing; and many are the students of mine who have done the same. The circle of life becomes complete.

The room extends north, full of hard wooden seats. Abandoned on one near the back is a coat.

Someone has taped to the wall a course advertisement for next quarter, inviting interested undergraduates to enroll in Interlingua 101. Probably Professor Higgate's work.

/We (take|get|pick up|acquire) the coat. It's been abandoned here for a while, since this isn't the time of year when people wear coats. It's brown cloth, only thick enough to keep out rain or a mild chill, and it's rubbed shiny at the elbows. No wonder the owner didn't miss it much.

From there we have an invigorating climb up, with the view of the sea getting better and better as we go \(but of course looking requires stopping to gaze back over our shoulder\).

We walk through the wealthy neighborhood to Roget Close. There we slip between the houses and down a path that looks as though it might lead to someone's back yard. No one has ever put up signage to correct this misapprehension because no one who lives around here is eager to encourage strangers on the private beach.

Soon, however, the footpath begins to descend purposefully towards the level of the ocean.

Winding Footpath
The footpath winds between the villas, sloping steeply downward. It is narrow, and bushes left and right conceal it even from the windows of the people living nearby.

The snapping continues.

> x bushes
Some variety I'm not familiar with: dark glossy green leaves, thick stems. In the right season, and I can't even remember what season that is, they also grow gaudy pink flowers. But not now. Lots of kudzu grows through and over the bushes — this is one of the few spots on the island where it hasn't been eradicated, it seems.

At one point along the path the bushes stick out especially far, as though there's something behind them.

> look under bushes
It's hard to get a good look under the bushes with all this kudzu in the way.

The snapping continues.

> x kudzu
An invasive vine grown through and over the bushes.

> wave z-remover at kudzu
We reset the device to z. With a distinct whiff of sweaty animal, the kudzu turns into a kudu. It's a creature like an antelope, with tall, twisting horns and a little white tuft of beard.

The kudu looks at us cleverly for a moment and then bounds away.

The snapping continues.

> look under bushes
Hunting behind the bushes reveals something I vaguely remember seeing when I was a child, but not noticing again since: built into the wall is what looks like a very ancient sort of shrine.

The snapping continues.

> x shrine
There's a niche dug into the stone of the wall, above a low relief of three ladies. It's not very good work to start with, and has been eroded by a lot of weather, and I wouldn't be surprised if this weren't its original location; it probably stood somewhere else and was brought here.

> go to roget close
Roget Close
A pleasantly sheltered lane in which I learned to ride a bicycle, and where my friend Lucy used to live, before she and her parents moved off-island. Restrictions were looser even twenty years ago. Our old schoolhouse is just west of here.

If you look just north between the houses, you'll notice also the footpath down to an almost-private beach. It used to be open, but it's now gated off, and built into the gate is a chic modern sculpture.

The snapping continues.

/(Something makes you think|You are reminded|You have a fleeting thought) of your crew's skill.

The mirror rotates in leisurely fashion, and when it is done there is a nib.

This big, slightly drab area holds such useful objects as the mailboxes and the secretary's computer. On ordinary days the secretary would be in as well, presiding over affairs. The offices of individual professors lie north and west, though both doors are closed.

The department printer sits on the u-shaped desk.

/(Waterstone|He) looks at the peacock, briefly arrested by some thought. He gets a monocle like mine out of his drawer. He looks through it at the peacock, notes the cock and the pea; grins. He gets up and comes out of his office.

"This is perfect," he says. "One more example to put into my talk — but I really should be going — should be able to get a ride from my wife — if I leave now — Here, you can have this if it interests you. I won't have time to use it." He sets an invitation down on the desk.

"Come back and talk to me again later," he adds. "We can discuss your goals as a student. And now I really have to go — should have gone hours ago." (There, see: he can be a nice man. More or less.)

He locks his door again and goes out. I think he is actually humming something.


Before we can do anything, Waterstone pops his head back in. "What you did there — not strictly within the rules. But I admire, shall we say, Realpolitik. You'll go far. Ignore Brown, but you'd probably do that anyway. Never talk to Higgate at all. I will see you later."

This is the center of the university, a broad grassy oval shaded with sycamore trees and surrounded by buildings in brick or white stone.

Immediately south of here is the building where I spend most of my time, Samuel Johnson Hall.

We can also see a sin here.

There are a couple of officers lounging by the university gate. We won't be able to go by without being seen.

As I'm taking this in, you notice hubbub behind us. We move out of the way as more officers escort Professor Higgate from the building.

"There's been a mistake," Higgate is saying coolly. "That conversation was conducted under a special license for research in constructed languages. I can produce a copy —"

The officer leading her says, "We're acting on information." He gives a quick, revealing glance in the direction of Professor Brown, who is also coming out of the building.

The snapping continues.

Time crawls by. We're looking as harmless and inattentive as humanly possible.

"Alex Rosehip," says the officer with Higgate. The back of my neck prickles. "What can you tell me about his constructed language?"

Higgate stops moving forward and the officers stop with her. "It really is a masterpiece — the root words are all based on resources common in the tropics. Dirt and mud are highly productive terms, as are many common pests. The syllables are consonant-dense but still relatively easy to pronounce. In my view, it's the most credible proposal ever put forward in utopian linguistics."

The officer smiles faintly. "Isn't that a bit like 'the world's most credible proposal for a perpetual motion engine'?"

The snapping continues.

> z
Time crawls by.

"Whether it works or not, I am sure it's not intended as an attack on the Anglophone efficacy," Higgate says. "Alex has a fine mind but very little gumption. And he loves Atlantis."

"As far as you're aware," the officer replies.

"Obviously," Higgate snaps. "I can only tell you what I know of Alex from five years of close supervision."

The officers look at one another, then back at her. "We're going to need to continue this conversation in depth."

A stricken expression crosses Higgate's face.

The snapping continues.

"I'd like to make a call," Higgate says.

"Not possible," says the man at her elbow.

Tall Street
Tall Street is full of families, some reaching as far as the old park at the east end of the street.

They're gathered around a hanging cardboard figure in front of the Bureau of Orthography. The children, and a few of the adults, are taking turns hitting it with sticks, hoping for a shower of comma-shaped candy. This is a common holiday activity, but from the disgruntled comments and the petulant expressions of the children, it has already been going on longer than is strictly fun.

The figure is made of cardboard and papier-mâché, designed for children to hit with sticks until candy and treats fall out: it's what would be called a piñata, if that weren't a dangerous loan word.

Abandoned Park
In contrast with the parks in the more savory parts of town, this is a bit of patchy grass where local dogs occasionally come out to do their business. A granite war memorial is fixed at the center, which is why tourist maps optimistically call the place Monument Green. But the memorial is only moderately monumental and the grass hardly green at all.

We step on a twig before we back away again.

It is a place that might have been developed long ago; only it is known that there are remains of Roman settlement here, and there is a risk that digging out the foundations would turn up some of those ruins, exposing a large number of Latin-language objects to the light of day. To prevent this catastrophe the whole area has been placed off limits to development.

We take a good swing with the stick and connect, finally, with the hanging Atlantida figure.

There is a resounding crack!

The crowd roars with approval, and dozens of small bodies surge around us so that I almost lose our balance. We push our swatch up out of our way.

The ground is covered with glitter and candy and confetti; the Atlantida has broken open at the torso.

The children gather their heaps of candy and a few scoops of glittery confetti as well, but eventually trickle away again with their parents, returning through the park or down side streets or to their cars.

Abandoned Park
In contrast with the parks in the more savory parts of town, this is a bit of patchy grass where local dogs occasionally come out to do their business. A granite war memorial is fixed at the center.

A twig lies in the grass.

We can go southeast to the Bus Station and west to Tall Street from here.

Bus Station
A currently-desolate depot from which buses run seasonally to Maiana, the island's other major town. The old station building is a low, rectilinear edifice from the 60s, all pebbled concrete and sheet glass, but it's shut, leaving accessible only a series of empty bus bays and a wall-mounted schedule. The public convenience to the east is the only thing open, while the area to the northwest is open parkland.

A dove flutters from one surface to another, occasionally stopping to stare at us.

A shed, rather ramshackle and unlikely, sits on the pavement, where it ought to be in the way of incoming buses.

The snapping continues.

/(Something makes you think|You are reminded|You have a fleeting thought) of leaving your family for the last time.

> x schedule
The schedule is an intricate affair, and the deciphering of the various letter-codes and footnotes was actually a subject of study in my grade school. The buses run every sixty-two minutes during daylight in the winter, every forty-three minutes in summer, with every third bus running as an express without stops if the passengers of this bus do not vote otherwise.

During the run of the school year there is an extra inbound bus in the morning and outward in the afternoon; contrariwise the bus is on half-schedule Sundays and holidays, except major patriotic holidays when there is no bus at all.

Like today.

> x shed
Sheds like this are typically cheap and very very temporary housing for the homeless. The policy of the Bureau is that no one is allowed to beg, and punishments for begging and homelessness are often quite stiff, so there is nothing in the way of an established shelter on the island and little recourse for those who might need it.

Echoing space, marble floor, eye-like skylight many meters above us: so far, the Rotunda might belong to any 19th-century government bureau of means and self-importance.

What sets this one apart is the lettering, each sigil no bigger than a flea, carved over every inch of the walls. Inscribed here is, in fact, the entire text of A New Orthodox Orthography. The administrative part of the bureau is away to the south, and there is an exhibit of letter tools to the east, which is open to the public.

Near the street entrance is a sizable informational bulletin-board advertising the services of the Bureau.

Antechamber
The most important task of any government bureau is to keep away time-wasters, irritants, and uninformed members of the general public, who might distract the diligent workers within from their important tasks. The Bureau of Orthography is no different.

An instructive notice details the criteria for entry to the Bureau proper.

Here to guard access to the rest of the building is a secretary on a tall stool. The secretary is carrying the Regulation Authentication Scope and wearing a pencil skirt and a plain white top.

We can go north to the Rotunda and east from here.

She turns her eyes towards us but doesn't say anything.

/(We could|I'd like to|We want to|I'm inclined to|My response would be to) ask whether she enjoys her job.

> show pass to secretary
We show our pass to the secretary.

The secretary raises her Authentication Scope to look at the pass. There is a moment of silence. The scope does nothing.

"That will do," the secretary says of our pass. Then she inspects the invitation with the monocle. "Most of the visits were earlier in the day," she says. "Quite a fracas there was this morning."

"The invitation doesn't state a particular time," we say.

She deflates momentarily and goes back to inspecting. "There's another problem. This invitation is for Professor Waterstone. They're watermarked individually to avoid fraud. You're not Professor Waterstone."

"He sent me to do some research in his place. I'm a student of his."

She frowns. "Invitations to inspect highly secure machinery are not transferrable," she says. "And how should I know whether you stole it?"

> e
I'm handling this.

"Professor Waterstone is a busy man," I say. "If you want me to tell him you wouldn't cooperate, I'm just as happy not to work on Serial Comma Day. But if DCL wants his endorsement or advice, they'll have to work within his schedule. If you are going to turn me away, however, I would like the opportunity to speak with your manager."

The secretary scowls. "Fine. I'll contact Waterstone." She places a call — on speakerphone, no less — glaring all the time.

"Waterstone here," says the phone. There's background traffic noise. Waterstone must be on the road already. Figures he would have a car phone. Most people aren't allowed, here.

"I have a student here attempting to use your invitation to enter the Bureau," says the secretary. "Was it stolen?"

"What? Oh that. No."

"You're saying you gave your invitation away."

"Yes I did," says Waterstone. "And I have been a research partner to DCL since before you were born."

"Sir, you are aware that this is highly irregular!"

> z
Sure, hang in there. I'm pretty sure that what we need here is to act as much like Professor Waterstone himself as humanly possible.

The secretary is still talking. "You personally vouch for this student? You know her well and are sure of her trustworthiness?"

"Known her for years," lies Waterstone, annoyed. There's a click as he hangs up.

"What a delightful man," remarks the secretary.

She looks over our other visible possessions (the stick, the ink, the sill, and the backpack) and deems them acceptable. She makes us sign a book, for which we use a signature of your invention. Finally: "Go in, descend to the basement, and present yourself at the secure section downstairs. Be advised you will be under video surveillance as you approach. Any attempts to modify or steal Bureau property, to gain access to rooms to which you have not been expressly invited, to eavesdrop on conversations of Bureau employees, or to leave objects of your own behind in the Bureau, may result in your arrest and prosecution.

Bureau Hallway
This is a long hallway with many doors leading off, the business of the bureau being varied and all-encompassing; it is for all essential purposes the chief organ of government in Atlantis, since only a few topics are brought to citizen referendum.

All-Purpose Office
There's a front desk at which a receptionist meets with members of the public and assesses their needs; beyond that, the room is crowded with dozens of stations for the use of the All-Purpose Officers, and stretches back some distance. It looks like an old-fashioned newsroom.

Fully half the stations are empty, due to their owners being away on call somewhere on the island, but the rest are fully occupied — many of them by people who wear authentication monocles routinely.

I'm pretty sure that hanging out here is the best way to get caught in a hurry, though, so let's duck back out, shall we? Maybe one of the other rooms will offer us better prospects.

We have descended into a windowless underground passage. The hallway runs north from here, and for an eerily long way — the tunnels must extend well beyond the above-ground profile of the building.

Propped in the corner are some articles that were probably meant to be used as part of the Serial Comma Day Fair, but got confiscated instead: a seer automaton and a plywood cutout depicting Atlantida.

We can go north and up to the Bureau Hallway from here.

The guards have apparently been instructed to allow us in, because as we approach, the door slides open.

The door seals behind us as soon as we are through.

Bureau Basement Secret Section
The heightened security on this side of the door is obvious everywhere we look. The floor is tiled in paisley tiles. The light fixtures give off pale pink light. The walls are covered in frog leather. The doors are locked with padlocks the size of handbags, locks decorated à la Louis Quinze, combination locks made of solid gold. There is not a bare noun in sight.

The hallway runs from south (comparatively normal) to north (deeply frightening). Just west is the equipment testing room.

Sensitive Equipment Testing Room
A room with no windows, no cameras, no recording equipment, and barely any furniture.

A rock sits in one corner of the room.

At the center of the room is a gleaming new T-inserter Machine. This is a state of the art device: letter removal has been well understood for decades, but insertion is much more dangerous and difficult, fraught with ambiguity.

> open pack
We open the backpack.

The snapping continues.

> gel rock
We dip out a pea-sized quantity of gel and rub it gently onto the rock. With an audible SPLORT, the rock becomes Brock. He looks a bit haggard to me, but I don't think anything too horrible has happened to him. So perhaps you can stop worrying.

Brock stands, dusting himself off. He looks us up and down without expression, without any sign of recognition. "What day is it?" he asks.

"Still Serial Comma Day," you say. "Brock, it's me. And Alex, but I'm here."

The waxen look melts and he grins. "Thank god. It's harder than you'd expect being a rock."

We just touch a coated fingertip of gel to the ink. With an audible SPLORT, the ink becomes a sink.

"I didn't have time to run the tests I wanted to run on the T-inserter. It'll take three minutes and then we can go. We need to do abstracts, animates, and a stability check."

The sink is far too large for us to carry, and falls onto the floor.

/("I know there's no time," he says. "But there are supposed to be all sorts of things in the Bureau sub-basement that have never seen the light of day. DCL projects that went wrong, secret government experiments, possibly a buried command center.")?

>put sin in t-inserter
(first taking the sin)
There are two small pops from the machine as it turns the sin into a stint.

The flickering images represent a period of time spent in the military: a young person in a uniform, smartly waving goodbye to hazily-sketched parents; a duration of training and mostly boring patrol work; release from service, with a few mild commendations and some pocket money.

"Right. It's good on abstracts, then," Brock says, contemplating the stint.

We reset the device to n. With a distinct whiff of fresh air, the tint turns into a tit. A small, harmless-looking bird.

He eyes the tit. "Oh for a homonym paddle."

The tit clambers out of the T-inserter machine.

/We reset the device to t. There is a [a-z \-]+, and the tit turns into an I. It's an abstract that looks like a bit of mirror.

It's like looking in the mirror at reality as it should be.

You doubtless see yourself too — as you are, or perhaps as you want to be.

He cocks his head to look at the I. "I have surprisingly good hair for someone who has just been a rock."

"Objects in mirror may appear more attractive than they are," we remark.

Of course, there were other options there: the T-inserter could have made two words. But it seems to be disambiguating to the tit. The question now is whether it would do so consistently or whether its behavior is underdetermined; we don't have time for a really thorough trial set, but checking a couple more times may be indicative.

"No problem creating creatures," Brock says judiciously.

/(The tit stares at us|He's looking at us, but when I look back, he cuts his eyes away|He watches us with a slightly disturbing intentness in his eyes|He cranes to look around at the back of the machine, but doesn't find anything interesting|He pauses, listening for noises outside|He runs his fingers over the surface of the machine, checking for hot spots|He stands back, regarding the T-inserter thoughtfully|He knocks on the top of the T-inserter).

It's itself. It. The epitome of itness. Philosophers would pay millions.

There now: the T-inserter has constructed both tit and it. Not very stable, it seems. Slango will be interested to know that.

"Check," says Brock. "And that's all we need here. Now..." He hesitates. "One person escaping is easier than two, I suppose."

You start to object, but I say, "Yes, you'd better return to petrified form." You know I'm right. He'll be easier to carry.

He's wearing his ordinary work clothes, but he looks strained to the point of fracture. And someone could come out of any of these doors at any moment.

"Your mother told me about meeting your supposed girlfriend at your apartment. She was puzzled by that, but I knew what must have happened," my father says, in a very low voice.

"Here's what we're going to do, Alex. You're going in there—" (he points at a door to the southwest) "—and I'm going to call for backup to arrest the first person that comes out. That could be Alex, it could be whoever-else-you-are, it could be both of you in this same body.

"If it is Alex who comes back out, I can't possibly save your university career, but we might be able to make a case for clemency." What he means by that— oh. Yes. I understand now.

He gives us a hard shove. We're half inside the room when we hear his last remark:

"Alex... don't try to escape back through the Rotunda. If you really can't come home, then head north. I've never seen it, but supposedly there's an emergency exit up there."

Then he's gone.

Cold Storage
Shelves on both sides of the room are full of objects on stands: objects that used to be men and women, and in a few cases even children. The stand labels preserve their original names.

A duty roster is posted prominently.

If this goes wrong, we could wind up living in here permanently. So we'd better figure whom to send out, and do it fast.

The pa looks at us in confusion. "OUT," you say, pointing at the door.

I keep thinking: my father is going to look like a fool when it's found he's arrested a fake person; he'll be disgraced.

I want to stop you, but you've got the upper hand now.

The pa backs out the door.

There's a noise like the firing of a restoration gel rifle and the sound of the pa collapsing into a pearl. "Nice try," shouts a voice from outside. "Next?"

I vote we gel Brock and send him out to my father. No, hear me out. Brock's cover is probably not in great shape anyway. You might be able to rescue him later. And it would be a coup for my father to have a real big arrest to put on the record.

Equipment Archive
The ceiling is mirrored, perhaps to make it harder for anyone to sneak around without being noticed among the shelves.

/The equipment shelves here display an assortment of obsolete, broken, foreign, or otherwise unusual letter tools. (On the equipment shelves|There) are an accent flipper, an umlaut punch, a Catalan punt volat needle, some broken components, and some lamb granulates( on the equipment shelves)?.

The functional area continues to the south, and the hallway is west.

> put pass in punch
I put the pass into the wire basket of the umlaut punch. There is a hum as the punch warms up, then a bang! as the tines come down sharply, tattooing the pass.

/Briefly the pass appears as the (art|thrash|death|speed|power) metal band Päss, before fading back to itself: there just isn't enough energy to hold the conversion, given Päss's (weak|non-existent|fading) (name-recognition|reputation).

Display Reloading Room
This area is more or less empty. Hazard tape marks off an area of the floor to indicate that I shouldn't stand there.

A black and white tv monitor is embedded in the wall.

There is a small black push-button on the wall.

> press button
A heavy clunk sounds. On the tv monitor, I see the display case black out.

Then there is a groaning of moving metal, and part of the ceiling lowers. This is, apparently, how displays are swapped out for the tools exhibit upstairs: the display platform is lowering to our level, providing access. This brings the Model T, the Etymological Reversing Chamber, and the anagramming gun down into the room.

> get gun
/I (take|get|pick up|acquire) the anagramming gun. Anagramming guns are illegal now, of course, because of their desperately unpredictable behavior. This one is a huge heavy thing, though not quite an artillery piece, because of the colossal amounts of power required and all the stabilizers needed to try to collapse the letters back down to a single phrase.

/The equipment shelves here display an assortment of obsolete, broken, foreign, or otherwise unusual letter tools. (On the equipment shelves|There) are an accent flipper, an umlaut punch, a Catalan punt volat needle, some broken components, and some lamb granulates( on the equipment shelves)?.

The functional area continues to the south, and the hallway is west.

> gel lamb
I dip out a pea-sized quantity of gel and rub it gently onto the lamb granulates. With an audible SPLORT, the lamb granulates become some anagram bullets. Heavy, high-impact stuff. Anagramming requires a great deal of force to break the linguistic cohesion of the word or phrase being modified. On the other hand, it's the one process that is routinely effective even on adjective-adhering nouns.

I fire the anagramming gun into the ceiling mirror. The reflection at once converts the anagramming gun into an anagramming gnu.

The gnu stares around in confusion, its watery gaze temporarily dissolving everything it looks at, until at last it happens to catch its own reflection.

A moment later, the anagramming gun is merely a gun again.

Oracle Project
This is nothing less than the command center for a massive propaganda campaign. Paintings of Atlantida and polling charts cover the walls, dating back to the second world war and continuing straight through to the present.

/(There are a paperweight and an inciting fable on the long table|On the long table are a paperweight and an inciting fable).

I can go south to Wonderland and east from here.

> x fable
It's a short children's tale, with illustrations. A young boy was left an orphan in a certain village. So he went door to door around the village, but none of the families would take him in, all having some excuse: there were too many children already, the house was too small, there was not enough food, the parents were too old for a new child, and so on.

Despondent, the boy was on the verge of giving up when a magician came to town. He went around door to door with the boy a second time, this time asking each household for just one letter. When he was done, he used a powerful machine on the letters in his bag, and transformed them into a LOVING FAMILY!

(The text ends here, but the illustration shows the boy beaming in the arms of a manufactured mother, father, siblings, hamster, and goldfish.)

> gel fable
I dip out a pea-sized quantity of gel and rub it gently onto the inciting fable. With an audible SPLORT, the inciting fable becomes a filing cabinet. There are numerous files, and they are organized chronologically, so that it's possible to look up a specific year. They appear to begin in 1942.

> x charts
Blue lines on the charts record the citizen responses to the concept of Atlantida. They record wartime progress in establishing the concept in the popular imagination, with a spike in 1942, corresponding to a heavy press of propaganda.

After the war, there's a break in the charts until 1951, when tracking resumes. Additional spikes appear at 1968 and 1972.

Each chart also shows a yellow line, which roughly goes down as the blue line goes up. It is labeled "Power to generate animate abstract." The yellow line stops at 1982 and no further points are recorded on it.

> look up 1942 in cabinet
Checking through the filing cabinet for 1942 reveals some images of Atlantida. Here is her militant 1940s rendition, where she stands bestride Atlantis; Axis planes are flying past her at head level. At any moment she might bite one and shake it, like a bulldog.

> look up 1982 in cabinet
A business-like, formidable Atlantida in the early 80s, looking Strong On Defense and Tough On Misspelling, with an olive branch in one hand and an anagramming gun in the other.

> gel paperweight
I dip out a pea-sized quantity of gel and rub it gently onto the paperweight. With an audible SPLORT, the paperweight becomes a weight and a paper.

> x paper
It contains a memo, dated to May of 1983. "Attention," it says. "Due to subversive counter-propaganda altering the abstract concept, Subject A must NO LONGER BE GELLED AFTER USE, since reconstructing her may produce anomalous results. She will from now on be housed in a continuous living state in the historic apartments."

...and so on, scrolling back and back and back.

> select power
The screen flashes up a schematic of the entire Bureau — the public rooms we're familiar with, the basement, and the special section we're in now. It appears that three different power supplies feed these, one for the public areas and one, more heavily backed up, for most of the basement. Both of these are running.

A third power supply is located east of here, and is currently shut down, leaving the eastern rooms dark.

Tunnel through Chalk
This passage has been cut through natural cliff rock and looks older than the Bureau itself. The walls are rough-hewn, exposing sedimentary strata. Here and there it looks as though someone has actually excavated a favored rock or relic.

Blocking the far end of the corridor is a metal portcullis. It is currently lowered. From the pulley above the portcullis hangs a counter.

> put pastis in bucket
There is a churning noise from within the brushed steel bucket, and a moment later I see inside some pestos. Glass jars contain three types of local pesto: a traditional basil and garlic variety, a sun-dried tomato pesto, and the infamous squid-flake pesto. The jars are packaged in a glossy cardboard box, suitable for taking back to one's mother-in-law after a trip to Atlantis.

This appears to have unlocked the mechanism. With a growl, the boiler comes to life.

> look in pane
Water flows steadily through a large pipe. Floating on the surface of the water are bergs of ice; before they melt entirely, a zap from a b-remover converts them to ergs. Each time this happens, there is a flash of light and steam, and the pane of glass becomes temporarily too fogged up to see through. The steam gauge needles jump.

Gradually the passage of the water cools the pane down again.

"Don't move, Alexandra, or I'll split you in two."

A very tall woman with Bureau-blue eyes steps into the room from the east, carrying a restoration gel rifle. Her face is ageless, her mouth full-lipped but proud. We've never met, but I recognize her at once.

Atlantida moves the rifle a fraction and fires through the portcullis at the counterweight. With an audible SPLORT, the counterweight becomes a weight and a counter.

The weight falls to the ground.

The portcullis crashes shut.

> x stamp
It is made to stamp two words: ETHICAL VETO. The discoloration shows it has indeed been used, though not, perhaps, very recently.

> z
Time passes.

She fires again. The pellet hits us, cold and hard, in the shoulder. It stings like hell and for a moment I think our clavicle is broken. I put our hand over the wounded spot.

Our hand.

Atlantida lowers the rifle, surprised. "Fused," she says. "Isn't that interesting. And so recently, too. If the gel rifle won't separate you, nothing will." She smiles, not warmly. "Pity. You would have been easier to deal with separately. Cold Storage for Andra, house arrest for Alex."

Fused? We should be two pieces by now. Maybe she has an explanation? But you seem to be focused on her gun hand. How can you be so calm?

> shoot gun at atlantida
The gun fires ruggedly into Atlantida, but is unable to make anything interesting out of a, a, a, d, i, l, n, t, and t. Atlantida recoalesces into her original form.

Atlantida smiles with half a mouth. "You've arrived on a difficult day. In the ordinary course of things, I keep things quiet: the spirit of democracy, but none of the sordid wrangling and bribes and corruption and compromise. It's only when the spirit of the island itself is threatened, that we have to resort to such extreme measures."

/(I could|I'd like to|I want to|I'm inclined to|My response would be to) ask whether the protesters feel the same way.

> shoot gun at rifle
The gun fires ruggedly into the restoration gel rifle, which shatters and then reforms as an infertile astrologer. She's a woman with long grey hair, well past menopause.

The infertile astrologer falls awkwardly to earth and looks around in confusion.

/(("Mercury is in retrograde,"|"Today is a day of revelation,") (comments|announces) the astrologer.( "Expect disordered communications.")?)?

"Oh, bravo," says Atlantida. "Could you possibly have made a less useful ally?"

> gel atlantida
We dab a bit on our finger and approach, but she is far too large, far too spry. She catches our wrist and forces us aside, until the gel is harmlessly absorbed into our own skin.

/(("Mercury is in retrograde,"|"Today is a day of revelation,") (comments|announces) the astrologer.( "Expect disordered communications.")?)?

"Oh, no, my dear," Atlantida says. "They could remake me, but it wouldn't be the same me, would it? It would be some new construct. The Atlantida of today. And that's not the way to a consistent policy, is it?"

> gel astrologer
I dip out a pea-sized quantity of gel and rub it gently onto the infertile astrologer. With an audible SPLORT, the infertile astrologer becomes a restoration gel rifle.

Atlantida realizes that the restoration gel rifle is now a couple of meters away from her.

She presses a button on something in her hand. Far away, a high-pitched bell rings.

"Did you have anything else you wanted to ask me? I so rarely get to talk with ordinary citizens. Only ones with clearance, and those about to go into Cold Storage. A last interview with Saint Peter."

> shoot rifle at atlantida
We sidle over and casually pick up the restoration gel rifle as though we were just curious. Or maybe had an insatiable urge to tidy up.

Her eyes follow the gesture. "Don't you dare, you little traitor," she says. "I have been your mother, your father, your waking up and your going to sleep, your teachers and your lovers and your friends. I am the integrity of this island. Change me and you change Atlantis forever."

"Maybe it's time," I say. "Maybe part of the business of democracy is having the arguments—"

You don't let me finish. I shoot the restoration gel rifle at Atlantida. With an audible SPLORT, Atlantida becomes an atlantida. It's a sort of shellfish, vaguely like a clam or scallop but bigger and with different ridges.

She gets to her feet.

"You'd better leave, quickly," she says. "I'll make sure your friends get out, but it will be easier if we don't have to explain you as well."

A window in the north wall, cut out through the cliff face, gives a view of tranquil sea under a darkening sky.

/Left on a coffee table \(as though waiting for maid service\) is a silver tray. (There|On the silver tray) are a cloth napkin, some crumbs, and a dirty coffee cup( on the silver tray)?.

/(There|On the chaise longue) is an ebook reader( on the chaise longue)?.

From the other room, the noises make it sound as though someone is using a metal torch to dismantle the portcullis bar by bar.

> n
I open the tall window.

As soon as we're through, Atlantida closes the window behind us, and we hear it lock. No evidence that we came through here, now.

Precarious Perch
From up here there's a handsome view of the sea, which isn't so far down really. But it's a scramble down a nearly sheer cliff for the first bit, until I make it down to the rockfall below, and it would be easy for a careless person to injure herself.

It's hard to see through the tall window to the room behind: mostly it reflects the sea.

> d
It's a nasty business lowering ourselves over the edge, with little to hold onto up here; scrabbling around with our toes for good holds; letting go with one hand to descend a little further...

But after some minutes of this painstaking process the cliff begins to slope outward more, and it's no longer a question of climbing down a face, but rather of scrambling down over boulders. And then...

Abandoned Shore
There's a little inlet of shore here, mostly boulders with little sand, completely cut off from the dock area and sheltered by the curve of the rock so that it wouldn't be visible from the sea unless someone were very close in.

There is a squid in the tidal pools among the boulders.

A bollard is bolted to one of the rocks, which is curious considering the otherwise unused and inaccessible look of the spot.

An old but still serviceable kayak is drawn up and firmly shackled to the bollard.

> x boulders
Rough black rock, the kind that tears up your hands if you try to hold onto it too tightly.

On the boulders is a squid.

> wave q-remover at squid
I reset the device to q. With a distinct whiff of sweaty animal, the squid turns into a suid.

Achievement accomplished: Admiral Thoureaux award for removing every letter of the alphabet in one playthrough!

A suid is any kind of pig; this one is a sizable domestic sow, as it turns out.

> wave l-remover at bollard
I reset the device to l. With a distinct whiff of raw wood, the bollard turns into a board. It's a fairly generic plank — sort of pine, by the looks of it, though constructed things tend to be a little vague on niceties such as species — and looks like it's designed to be part of a new deck or somesuch thing.

> wave d-remover at board
I reset the device to d. With a distinct whiff of sweaty animal, the board turns into a boar. In the old days they used to hunt these animals, and I can understand the impulse. It's like a pig, but even uglier and bristlier, with long dangerous-looking tusky teeth coming out of both its top and bottom jaws.

The boar looks at me unpleasantly, but then the pleasing scent of the suid attracts it instead.

> wave b-remover at boar
I reset the device to b. Our hand is less than steady, but I manage to wave the letter-remover accurately enough.

The boar vanishes with a pop, and an oar falls harmlessly to the ground. It's a light sort of oar, almost a paddle. Still probably not the ideal thing for use with a kayak, but it'll do.

With some awkwardness, I manage to push off and begin to laboriously row for open sea.

Open Sea (in the kayak)
The water stretches in all directions, but I can see off to the north where Slango's yacht is anchored, ready to bring me back aboard. Its metallic blue shape almost blends in with the water.

If I were further around the island to the east, I might be able to see bits of the drowned city: both the buildings that were legitimately destroyed when the land sunk into the sea, and the areas where during the Civil Dispute of Standardization the authorities dumped unwanted foreign archaeological artifacts. But here I'm afraid it's just shellfish and sand down there.

> n
I come around to the aft of Slango's yacht and give a good shout. With the help of a ladder and a hand up from Slango himself, I soon have the kayak stored, and ourselves and our possessions on deck.

Before we can really start a conversation, Slango has a rough go at us with a washcloth and a tub of restoration gel. He is determined to separate you from me before he has a real talk with either of us; and it's not until a number of swipes in that he realizes how wrong things are.

"This isn't working," he remarks, tossing the gel and washcloth aside.

"We're fused," I explain, not very coherently. "Something happened. I don't know if it can be fixed."
"And Brock?" Slango demands. "Have you got him?"

I shake our head. "But he'll be released soon," I say. "I'm pretty sure I've seen to that."

"Pretty sure," Slango repeats.

I just look at him.

"Okay," he says, though it isn't. "Okay." And he goes to the cockpit and fires up the engine, while we watch the lights of Atlantis get farther away and finally dim.

Galley (aboard the True Macaque)
Smaller than the kitchen in a comfortable house, but carefully and elegantly fitted, with an electric stovetop, a convection oven/microwave, a tiny refrigerator, a sink: enough, in short, to serve the crew of three on long trips. I guess even a fairly big boat is still small on the inside, eh?

There's even a little washing machine, for items too big to hand-wash in the sink.

It's the Chard-Farmer's Daily from Atlantis. A huge headline is splashed across the front:

"REFERENDUM ANNOUNCED!"

The picture on the front shows the Atlantida statue decked out with lights like a Christmas tree and people posing next to her for pictures.

My father has been promoted, apparently, to something called the Provisional Committee for Orthographic Reform. He is quoted as saying that the amnesty for Cold Storage prisoners is an important step forward. "Of course, government by citizen referendum brings its own problems, and further constitutional work may be needed if we mean to bring Atlantis in line with the European Union."

Slango comes in, with Brock behind him. "Bad news," he says. "We're going to have to split that payout three ways instead of two. The new Atlantida has a perverse sense of humor. She express-mailed Brock to Mallorca for us. In rock form."

Brock bends down to massage his right thigh. "Turns out it's not comfortable having spent the night in a cardboard box, even if you were petrified at the time. Things to know and learn."

I study his face. It's the face he wears when he's reserving judgment about whether or not to be incredibly pissed off. You're the one who knows how to read that face, but I'm a little relieved to see it too.

"My father might've been inanimated instead," I say.

"Slango mentioned," Brock says.

"He's a lot older. I thought he might have some heart trouble or... or not deal with it well."

Brock studies us for a moment more. Then he reaches into his pocket and pulls out a huge gummy candy shaped like a squid.

"Want one? They used them as packing material in my shipping box. We've got lots."

"You must have me confused with someone else."

He sighs. Not deceived even a little; weary that we tried.



"I didn't tell your mother what I suspected, but when it comes out you've… defected… I won't be able to keep this from her. And you're giving up your career. Mine too, possibly; we'll all be under suspicion, I suppose.

"It's pointless. You could have done a great deal for the Bureau from within. I was trying to help you see that."

"I want to do something that matters," I say. "I don't see my work making a speck of difference here."

"You mean you don't see my work as important," he says. "Got that from your mother, I imagine."

"The law doesn't work unless it's got a few human beings outside of it," you say — drawing on one of Slango's sayings. "Every tyranny creates its own balancing force."

"You've left enough traces that people will know someone came in here today."

> z
Time passes.

"Here's what we're going to do, Alex. You're going in there—" (he points at a door to the southwest) "—and I'm going to call for backup to arrest the first person that comes out. That could be Alex, it could be whoever-else-you-are, it could be both of you in this same body.

"If it is Alex who comes back out, I can't possibly save your university career, but we might be able to make a case for clemency." What he means by that— oh. Yes. I understand now.

He gives us a hard shove. We're half inside the room when we hear his last remark:

"Alex... don't try to escape back through the Rotunda. If you really can't come home, then head north. I've never seen it, but supposedly there's an emergency exit up there."

Then he's gone.

Cold Storage
Shelves on both sides of the room are full of objects on stands: objects that used to be men and women, and in a few cases even children. The stand labels preserve their original names.

A duty roster is posted prominently.

If this goes wrong, we could wind up living in here permanently. So we'd better figure whom to send out, and do it fast.

> get pea
/We (take|get|pick up|acquire) the pea.

> wave e-remover at pea
We reset the device to e. With a distinct whiff of shaving cream, the pea turns into a pa. He's a Norman Rockwell figure: gruff, upstanding, honest, not a big talker. Doesn't actually come with a child attached, but it stands to reason he would have a large-ish brood of them.

The pa looks at us in confusion. "OUT," you say, pointing at the door.

I keep thinking: my father is going to look like a fool when it's found he's arrested a fake person; he'll be disgraced.

I want to stop you, but you've got the upper hand now.

The pa backs out the door.

There's a noise like the firing of a restoration gel rifle and the sound of the pa collapsing into a pearl. "Nice try," shouts a voice from outside. "Next?"

I vote we gel Brock and send him out to my father. No, hear me out. Brock's cover is probably not in great shape anyway. You might be able to rescue him later. And it would be a coup for my father to have a real big arrest to put on the record.

> z
Time passes.

> gel stands
Hang on — are you sure you want to send one of these poor bastards out there? It would be cruel to get their hopes up just to have them re-arrested, not to mention that it would make my father look like a fool if he arrested a dissident who turned out to have been in storage all along. >>
> yes

We gel the nearest of the objects, and it comes to life: a woman in her thirties or forties, at first so motionless that she looks like a statue, until she remembers that she can move.

"Thank goodness," says the woman. "I felt like I was going to lose myself if I had to spend another minute in there. I don't know who you are, but thank you, thank you! Is there a Bureau reprieve? Please tell me they've decided to let us all out!"

"No general reprieve," you say. "Just you."

This isn't what I want. It's not just unfair; it's actually monstrous. "What were you put in for?" I ask.

"Italian," she whispers.

"What?"

"I was learning Italian," she says. "I wanted to read Manzoni. There was no sympathy from the officers; they thought it was an inexplicable desire. Is it daylight or night-time out there? Not that it matters. I haven't seen either in so long."

You gesture at the door. She looks at us once more, doubtfully, and goes.

From the corridor comes the sound of a shot being fired from a restoration gel rifle; the woman exclaiming in pain; officers gathering around her for the arrest. And she'll be back here, I suppose, before the night is out. I suppose that allows you to tell yourself that it wasn't a bad thing, what we just did.

A faint spell comes over you and you feel dizzy.

Bureau Basement Secret Section
The heightened security on this side of the door is obvious everywhere you look. The floor is tiled in paisley tiles. The light fixtures give off pale pink light. The walls are covered in frog leather. The doors are locked with padlocks the size of handbags, locks decorated à la Louis Quinze, combination locks made of solid gold. There is not a bare noun in sight.

The cute security door at the south end is solidly shut; there's no sign of anyone still waiting on this side of it.

Going south through the security door isn't an option; our only way out is north. Just west is the equipment testing room, and southwest is Cold Storage.

The ridiculous décor continues, now so extreme that I cannot even put a name to the things around us. They might as well be extrusions from a nightmare by Dali, or by Dr. Seuss. Offices are accessed by hatchways that seem to have come from submarines, or through passages resembling the sphincter of a great whale, or up ladders decorated with human teeth.

A black and white tv monitor is embedded in the wall.

There is a small black push-button on the wall.

A heavy clunk sounds. On the tv monitor, you see the display case black out.

Then there is a groaning of moving metal, and part of the ceiling lowers. This is, apparently, how displays are swapped out for the tools exhibit upstairs: the display platform is lowering to our level, providing access. This brings the Model T, the Etymological Reversing Chamber, and the anagramming gun down into the room.

/You (take|get|pick up|acquire) the anagramming gun. Anagramming guns are illegal now, of course, because of their desperately unpredictable behavior.

The functional area continues to the south, and the hallway is west.

> gel lamb
You dip out a pea-sized quantity of gel and rub it gently onto the lamb granulates. With an audible SPLORT, the lamb granulates become some anagram bullets. Heavy, high-impact stuff. Anagramming requires a great deal of force to break the linguistic cohesion of the word or phrase being modified. On the other hand, it's the one process that is routinely effective even on adjective-adhering nouns.

The gnu stares around in confusion, its watery gaze temporarily dissolving everything it looks at, until at last it happens to catch its own reflection.

A moment later, the anagramming gun is merely a gun again.

Oracle Project
This is nothing less than the command center for a massive propaganda campaign. Paintings of Atlantida and polling charts cover the walls, dating back to the second world war and continuing straight through to the present.

/(On the long table|There) are a paperweight and an inciting fable( on the long table)?.

You can go south to Wonderland and east from here.

> x fable
It's a short children's tale, with illustrations. A young boy was left an orphan in a certain village. So he went door to door around the village, but none of the families would take him in, all having some excuse: there were too many children already, the house was too small, there was not enough food, the parents were too old for a new child, and so on.

Despondent, the boy was on the verge of giving up when a magician came to town. He went around door to door with the boy a second time, this time asking each household for just one letter. When he was done, he used a powerful machine on the letters in his bag, and transformed them into a LOVING FAMILY!

(The text ends here, but the illustration shows the boy beaming in the arms of a manufactured mother, father, siblings, hamster, and goldfish.)

> gel fable
You dip out a pea-sized quantity of gel and rub it gently onto the inciting fable. With an audible SPLORT, the inciting fable becomes a filing cabinet. There are numerous files, and they are organized chronologically, so that it's possible to look up a specific year. They appear to begin in 1942.

> x charts
Blue lines on the charts record the citizen responses to the concept of Atlantida. They record wartime progress in establishing the concept in the popular imagination, with a spike in 1942, corresponding to a heavy press of propaganda.

After the war, there's a break in the charts until 1951, when tracking resumes. Additional spikes appear at 1968 and 1972.

Each chart also shows a yellow line, which roughly goes down as the blue line goes up. It is labeled "Power to generate animate abstract." The yellow line stops at 1982 and no further points are recorded on it.

> look up 1942 in cabinet
Checking through the filing cabinet for 1942 reveals some images of Atlantida. Here is her militant 1940s rendition, where she stands bestride Atlantis; Axis planes are flying past her at head level. At any moment she might bite one and shake it, like a bulldog.

/You (take|get|pick up|acquire) the keycard.

You dip out a fingertip-coating quantity of gel and rub it gently onto the keycard. With an audible SPLORT, the keycard becomes a card and a key.

There is a churning noise from within the brushed steel bucket, and a moment later you see inside a curd. A soft white clump of cheese substance.

This appears to have unlocked the mechanism. With a growl, the boiler comes to life.

 34223 toys and diversions order at request of Subject A, children's jacks, balls, puzzles, games
 34222 espresso beans for Subject A - previous order unacceptable see attached
 34221 bakery requisition
 34220 coffee beans resupply for Subject A
 34219 berg resupply to boiler - previous supply melted - NB new supply is required even if not used
 34218 rifle resupply for handlers for Subject A, new gel required as safety measure

...and so on, scrolling back and back and back.

> select power
The screen flashes up a schematic of the entire Bureau — the public rooms we're familiar with, the basement, and the special section we're in now. It appears that three different power supplies feed these, one for the public areas and one, more heavily backed up, for most of the basement. Both of these are running.

A third power supply is located east of here, and is lit up like a Christmas tree with the tremendous amounts of power it's channeling.

Tunnel through Chalk
This passage has been cut through natural cliff rock and looks older than the Bureau itself. The walls are rough-hewn, exposing sedimentary strata. Here and there it looks as though someone has actually excavated a favored rock or relic.

Blocking the far end of the corridor is a metal portcullis. It is currently lowered. From the pulley above the portcullis hangs a counter.

You can go east through the portcullis (closed) and up to the Surveillance Room from here.

A surveillance computer is mounted on the wall, an impressive flat screen readout displaying current activity.

The Workshop lies to the east. The door you came through is west, and there is also a spiral staircase down to the tunnel.

A room whose importance is obvious from how clean it is and how little furniture it is allowed to have.

Generator Room
The walls are lined with concrete. Yellow paint lettering says CAUTION: HIGH ENERGY EQUIPMENT and DO NOT OPERATE WITHOUT TRAINING.

A first aid station is built onto the wall. It is closed.

Most of the room is taken up with a gigantic boiler installation periodically giving off flashes of light and steam. The locking mechanism is a brushed steel bucket, currently empty.

> look in pane
Water flows steadily through a large pipe. Floating on the surface of the water are bergs of ice; before they melt entirely, a zap from a b-remover converts them to ergs. Each time this happens, there is a flash of light and steam, and the pane of glass becomes temporarily too fogged up to see through. The steam gauge needles jump.

Gradually the passage of the water cools the pane down again.

> put gel on pass
You dip out a pea-sized quantity of gel and rub it gently onto the pass. With an audible SPLORT, the pass becomes a pastis.

> put pastis in bucket
There is a churning noise from within the brushed steel bucket, and a moment later you see inside some pestos. Glass jars contain three types of local pesto: a traditional basil and garlic variety, a sun-dried tomato pesto, and the infamous squid-flake pesto. The jars are packaged in a glossy cardboard box, suitable for taking back to one's mother-in-law after a trip to Atlantis.

The boiler growls but cannot become any more on than it already is.

Personal Apartment
At a guess, this is a room hardly anyone ever visits, or even knows about. Though the ceiling and one wall are bare cave, the rest has been paneled and graciously decorated in the style of the end of the 18th century. Oil paintings on the walls depict great men and women of Atlantis gone by: Phyllida Shaply, Amelia Landison, Clarence Arbot, Jon Rosehip. An antique bed stands in the center of the room.

The metal portcullis guards the way back. It is currently raised. From the pulley above the portcullis hangs a counterweight.

"Don't move, Alexandra, or I'll split you in two."

A very tall woman with Bureau-blue eyes steps into the room from the east, carrying a restoration gel rifle. Her face is ageless, her mouth full-lipped but proud. We've never met, but you recognize her at once.

Atlantida moves the rifle a fraction and fires through the portcullis at the counterweight. With an audible SPLORT, the counterweight becomes a weight and a counter.

The weight falls to the ground.

The portcullis crashes shut.

> x stamp
It is made to stamp two words: ETHICAL VETO. The discoloration shows it has indeed been used, though not, perhaps, very recently.

> z
Time passes.

She fires again. The pellet hits us, cold and hard, in the shoulder. It stings like hell and for a moment I think our clavicle is broken. You put our hand over the wounded spot.

Our hand.

Atlantida lowers the rifle, surprised. "Fused," she says. "Isn't that interesting. And so recently, too. If the gel rifle won't separate you, nothing will." She smiles, not warmly. "Pity. You would have been easier to deal with separately. Cold Storage for Andra, house arrest for Alex."

Fused? We should be two pieces by now. Maybe she has an explanation? But you seem to be focused on her gun hand. How can you be so calm?

> shoot atlantida with anagramming gun
The gun fires ruggedly into Atlantida, but is unable to make anything interesting out of a, a, a, d, i, l, n, t, and t. Atlantida recoalesces into her original form.

Atlantida smiles with half a mouth. "You've arrived on a difficult day. In the ordinary course of things, I keep things quiet: the spirit of democracy, but none of the sordid wrangling and bribes and corruption and compromise. It's only when the spirit of the island itself is threatened, that we have to resort to such extreme measures."

/(You could|I'd like to|You want to|I'm inclined to|My response would be to) ask whether the protesters feel the same way.

> shoot rifle with anagramming gun
The gun fires ruggedly into the restoration gel rifle, which shatters and then reforms as an infertile astrologer. She's a woman with long grey hair, well past menopause.

The infertile astrologer falls awkwardly to earth and looks around in confusion.

"Oh, bravo," says Atlantida. "Could you possibly have made a less useful ally?"

> gel atlantida
We dab a bit on our finger and approach, but she is far too large, far too spry. She catches our wrist and forces us aside, until the gel is harmlessly absorbed into our own skin.



"Oh, no, my dear," Atlantida says. "They could remake me, but it wouldn't be the same me, would it? It would be some new construct. The Atlantida of today. And that's not the way to a consistent policy, is it?"

> gel astrologer
You dip out a pea-sized quantity of gel and rub it gently onto the infertile astrologer. With an audible SPLORT, the infertile astrologer becomes a restoration gel rifle.

Atlantida realizes that the restoration gel rifle is now a couple of meters away from her.

She presses a button on something in her hand. Far away, a high-pitched bell rings.

"Did you have anything else you wanted to ask me? I so rarely get to talk with ordinary citizens. Only ones with clearance, and those about to go into Cold Storage. A last interview with Saint Peter."

> shoot atlantida with rifle
We sidle over and casually pick up the restoration gel rifle as though we were just curious. Or maybe had an insatiable urge to tidy up.

Her eyes follow the gesture. "Don't you dare, you little traitor," she says. "I have been your mother, your father, your waking up and your going to sleep, your teachers and your lovers and your friends. I am the integrity of this island. Change me and you change Atlantis forever."

"Maybe it's time," I say. "Maybe part of the business of democracy is having the arguments—"

You don't let me finish. You shoot the restoration gel rifle at Atlantida. With an audible SPLORT, Atlantida becomes an atlantida. It's a sort of shellfish, vaguely like a clam or scallop but bigger and with different ridges.

> get atlantida
/You (take|get|pick up|acquire) the atlantida. It's heavy as a rock, because it has been fossilized.

There's a distant sound of movement. Someone is looking for us.

Private Solarium
A window in the north wall, cut out through the cliff face, gives a view of tranquil sea under a darkening sky.

/Left on a coffee table \(as though waiting for maid service\) is a silver tray. (On the silver tray|There) are some jacks, a cloth napkin, some crumbs, and a dirty coffee cup( on the silver tray)?.

/(On the chaise longue is an ebook reader|There is an ebook reader on the chaise longue).

> n
You could do that. You could climb out that window and not look back. It would be faster, easier, unquestionably safer. But what about the people we're leaving behind? What about my father and Professor Higgate? What about the protesters who got arrested today?

We'll only know they're safe if we leave this island with a new, improved Atlantida. Someone the Bureau will have to listen to. The one they were afraid of creating. One who will put power back in the hands of the citizen referendum.

So you tell me how it's going to be. Are you going to stay and see to things? >>
> yes

That's what I thought.

A set of children's playing jacks. They are lined up, with curious precision, into the letter A.

> take jacks
/You (take|get|pick up|acquire) the jacks.

> wave s-remover at jacks
/You reset the device to s. There is a [a-z \-]+, and the jacks turn into a jack. A heavy-duty jack, suitable for raising cars or other substantial objects.

Workshop
A room whose importance is obvious from how clean it is and how little furniture it is allowed to have.

A programmable dais sits in the middle of the room. It has the raw look of lab equipment rather than a nice smooth commercial instrument.

A cord snakes across the floor, connecting the dais socket to the wall socket.

You can go east to the Generator Room and west to the Surveillance Room from here.

You definitely hear footsteps. And voices.

> put atlantida on platform
You put the atlantida on the programmable dais.

> set platform to homonym
You give the switch a strong twist and turn it to swap homonym.

> turn on platform
The programmable dais glows deep red. Almost at once Atlantida is lying on the surface. She looks very similar to her earlier self, but the differences are there. The eyes are grey now. A tattoo of a writhing squid encircles her left wrist. Her face is younger.

She gets to her feet.

"You'd better leave, quickly," she says. "I'll make sure your friends get out, but it will be easier if we don't have to explain you as well."

/(You could|I'd like to|You want to|I'm inclined to|My response would be to) ask how to fix the fusion.

> go to personal apartment
/(You |You have a (brief|quick|short) |You make the( brief| quick| short)? |It's a( brief| quick| short)? )(walk|hike).

Personal Apartment

Though the ceiling and one wall are bare cave, the rest has been paneled and graciously decorated in the style of the end of the 18th century. Oil paintings on the walls depict great men and women of Atlantis gone by: Phyllida Shaply, Amelia Landison, Clarence Arbot, Jon Rosehip. An antique bed stands in the center of the room.

Atlantida stands nearby, urging you to hurry out via the Private Solarium. I think she's enjoying her role as conspiratorial heroine.

The metal portcullis guards the way back. It is currently raised a few feet by a jack. From the pulley above the portcullis hangs a counter.

/(On the inlaid desk|There) are a stack of files and a rubber stamp( on the inlaid desk)?.

Air and sunlight stream in from the east.

Someone is coming into the workshop upstairs. There's at most a few seconds before they'll be down the tunnel.

> take jack
/You (take|get|pick up|acquire) the jack.

The portcullis crashes shut.

The portcullis should at least slow down anyone coming after us. Though that's only moderately comforting.

> e
She follows. "Go, go," she says. "You've done good work today. Atlantis is grateful."

/(There|On the chaise longue) is an ebook reader( on the chaise longue)?.

From the other room, the noises make it sound as though someone is using a metal torch to dismantle the portcullis bar by bar.

> n
You open the tall window.

As soon as we're through, Atlantida closes the window behind us, and we hear it lock. No evidence that we came through here, now.

Precarious Perch
From up here there's a handsome view of the sea, which isn't so far down really. But it's a scramble down a nearly sheer cliff for the first bit, until you make it down to the rockfall below, and it would be easy for a careless person to injure herself.

It's hard to see through the tall window to the room behind: mostly it reflects the sea.

> wave k-remover at rock
You reset the device to k. With a distinct whiff of sweaty animal, the rock turns into a roc. The bird is enormous. Brock is a tall man, but not nearly this tall. Its eyes are bright and (if you are not reading too much in) ironically clever; its plumage a little like an eagle's, if an eagle were made many times larger and feathered in a kind of sleek, luminous black.

The roc is too awkward for you to carry, and half-falls, half-jumps to the ground.

> ride roc
You mount the roc.

It stares at us for a moment, and you climb carefully onto its back, putting our arms around its neck. A dozen drawbacks occur at the last minute. What if there isn't enough room for the takeoff? What if it needs to run — like a plane — before it can get airborne?

The roc strains its neck forward, spreads its wings and steps off the cliff. Its flaps are slow and you are losing altitude — so fast that at first I think you'll fall into the ocean — but it takes only five or six flaps before the bird is able to glide straight out to sea.

> n
I think you pretty much have to go where the roc wants to go.

I keep thinking you are going to lose our grip, but somehow you manage to stay on. Sooner than I expect, you make out the shine of Slango's yacht, and in the next moment you are above it. The roc circles once or twice before coming to land on the Sunning Deck.

Sunning Deck (aboard the True Macaque)
This is a very fine boat: sleek, shiny, big... Oh, you don't like it when I put it that way, I see. All right then: a high-speed yacht, something luxurious enough that it looks like a rich man's toy to harbor officials, but it handles almost like a cigarette boat. Fiberglass hull, shaped in a deep V for racing, capable of 80 knots on a calm sea. Range of around 300 nautical miles, enough to take us past Gibraltar to Málaga or perhaps even Almeria.

This bit is the aft portion, broad and flat and suitable for sunning oneself.

Slango has come out, though he's standing well back from the roc, which is surveying the scene speculatively.

Fixed on the roof above the entry to the navigation area is a white object that looks a little like an igloo. It is the communication unit that handles the yacht's wifi connection.

Slango gels the roc easily enough. Then he and Brock turn the restoration gel on us. Slango is determined to separate you from me before he has a real talk with either of us; and it's not until a number of swipes in that he realizes how wrong things are.

"This isn't working," he remarks, tossing the gel and washcloth aside.

"We're fused," you explain, not very coherently. "Something happened. I don't know if it can be fixed."
Brock looks at us for a long moment and then turns away. He vanishes into the galley.

"I'm sure he's just gone to get you a cup of tea," Slango says. He takes a deep breath, stands. "The T-inserter specs better be worth what Brock says they are."

In the rocking boat, with the sound of the motor beneath us, you dream

of a ceremony on a clifftop with our two families seated looking on, and us in a long white dress, carrying a bouquet of scrabble tiles, walking down an aisle alone to be formally unified with ourself

of wearing a suit and meeting with some very rich men to talk about how to bring my language to Africa, and Brock giving us advice about how to handle them

of gathering all the indigenous languages, all the little dying languages, all the languages shoved aside because they lack linguistic efficacy, into a firefly bottle, where their letterforms flicker desperately

Galley (aboard the True Macaque)
Smaller than the kitchen in a comfortable house, but carefully and elegantly fitted, with an electric stovetop, a convection oven/microwave, a tiny refrigerator, a sink: enough, in short, to serve the crew of three on long trips. I guess even a fairly big boat is still small on the inside, eh?

There's even a little washing machine, for items too big to hand-wash in the sink.

It's the Chard-Farmer's Daily from Atlantis. A huge headline is splashed across the front:

"REFERENDUM ANNOUNCED!"

The picture on the front shows the Atlantida statue decked out with lights like a Christmas tree and people posing next to her for pictures.

My father has been promoted, apparently, to something called the Provisional Committee for Orthographic Reform. He is quoted as saying that the amnesty for Cold Storage prisoners is an important step forward. "Of course, government by citizen referendum brings its own problems, and further constitutional work may be needed if we mean to bring Atlantis in line with the European Union."

Brock comes down and hands us a coffee. "You look like you could use this. We've hit Mallorca," he says. "Slango's in town resupplying. I guess you saw the paper?"

You nod.

"One for the history books," he says, with a crooked smile. "They're showing satellite clips. Big olive garland on the depluralizing tank. People dancing on cars. Some old guy belting out La Marseillaise in the Bureau Rotunda."

Brock sits down opposite us. "In other news," he remarks, "it looks like your cut of the T-inserter plans, with all the tests we ran, is going to come out to this." He writes a number. The number has six zeroes.

He leans back and looks at us.

"So. Where do we go from here?"
