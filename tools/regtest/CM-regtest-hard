Good, you're conscious. We're conscious. I've heard urban legends about synthesis going wrong, one half person getting lost.

Do you remember our name?

Exactly right. And I'm Alex, making us jointly Alexandra. As far as I can tell, the operation was a success. We're meant to be one person now, unrecognizable to anyone who knew us before.

Counterfeit Monkey
A Removal by Emily Short
/Release.*


Let's try to get a look around. I haven't been able to run our body without your help, but maybe now you're awake, it'll work better.

Sigil Street
The buildings here are two and three stories, with shops at ground level and elderly apartments above. The shops are closed for the holiday: a typographer's office, tourist boutiques of colorful skirts and ethnic bodices (rarely if ever worn by natives) and t-shirts covered with font designs.

Passing by the reflective window we catch the sight of our single blended body, and it creeps me out.

A narrow alley runs between buildings to the south, while the street continues east.

> e

Ampersand Bend
A bend in the street, which runs west and north. This district combines the old and the new: a small museum in an ancient stone building to the east, a shiny real estate office south. The window of the museum is currently displaying one of its exhibits, a codex.

A temporary barrier blocks this empty street from the busy fair to the north, though there is a door that could be opened with the correct code. From here the gaiety and excitement of the holiday are fairly loud. 

> wave x-remover at codex
/We smoothly, and almost without thinking about it, reset your device to be an X-remover. There is a [a-z \-]+, and the codex turns into a code. A bit of paper on which is written "305."

[Your score has gone up by one point.]

> x code
A bit of paper on which is written "305."

> set barrier to 305
We set the wheels of the code-lock to 305.

Click! The barrier door unlocks.

> go to heritage corner
I'm glad to see you're feeling ready to face the wider world. Here's what we think we need to do: 
  Get my backpack from the cinema
  Retrieve your remaining possessions from locker at hostel
  Meet your colleague Slango at Counterfeit Monkey

[To go over our current goals, type GOALS at any time.]

/(We |We have a (brief|quick|short) |We make the( brief| quick| short)? |It's a( brief| quick| short)? )(walk|hike) among the (crowds|booths of the fair). 

Heritage Corner
This patch of the town square has been paved over in octagonal bricks and is commonly used for displays of traditional dancing: over-50 women in home-made embroidered aprons, skipping arm-in-arm and jumping over broomsticks.

No, there aren't any here now. But trust me. It's an unforgettable sight.

Under a bit of shelter in the corner, a diorama table shows scenes from local history, rotated out each week. This week's diorama represents the first sitting of the Committee for the New Orthodox Orthography. 

The park continues to the north and west; to the east is a backpackers' hostel where you've stayed recently and where you stowed the rest of your important possessions.

[Your score has gone up by three points and is now four.]

> wave y-remover at army
We run our thumb over the dial, setting the device to a Y-remover. We wave the Y-remover at the army and produce an arm, severed (because after all it would be beyond the parameters of the change to generate the person whose body part it is). It is only moderately gory, and most locals get used to seeing this kind of thing as a prank from six-year-olds every halloween. Still, it might startle a tourist.

> wave s-remover at members
/We reset the device to s. There is a [a-z \-]+, and the members turn into a member. It is a figure of a member of the Committee to Establish an Orthodox Orthography. It is plastic, small enough to sit on our palm, and wears the stiff clothing and conservative hairstyle of about 1895. It looks slightly cross, as though the member has guessed its work would take another 15 years to complete.

> get arm
/We (take|get|pick up|acquire) the arm. A girl's arm, by the look of it, amputated neatly at the shoulder joint. The fingernails are painted shell-pink.

/(We |We have a (brief|quick|short) |We make the( brief| quick| short)? |It's a( brief| quick| short)? )(walk|hike) among the (crowds|booths of the fair). 

Midway
Here in front of the pharmacy in the southwestern corner of the town square, various contests have been set up — a strong-man hammering contest, a contest to see who can burst the most balloons using a styrofoam dart-plane, and so on.

I assume you've noticed, though, the word-balance, which comes up as high as our hip. On the right pan is an apple and on the left a prickly pear.  

/Beside the word-balance is a barker in a blue suit, the same regulation blue used by the Bureau of Orthography. The barker (is also carrying|has) a tube. 

/("One tube of restoration gel goes to the first person who can unbalance the word-balance!"|"Put the beam out of alignment and win a fabulous prize!"|"Step up and try your hand at the fabulous word-balance!") (cries|says|calls) the barker(, (glance sweeping the crowd|holding up a tube)| appealingly).

/(We could|I'd like to|We want to|I'm inclined to|My response would be to) ask what the gel is worth, ask whether the game is rigged, or ask whether anyone ever wins.

> wave p-remover at apple
We reset the device to p. There's a smell of fermenting apple, then cider, then something more malty. In the apple's place there is now a glass of nutbrown ale.

There is a cheer from the spectators. The word-balance tilts slowly but inexorably.

The barker looks astonished and displeased, except for a fraction of a second when he just noticeably winks. With exaggerated bad grace hands us some restoration gel. "There's your prize. And now this contest is over."

He stalks away.

[Your score has gone up by three points and is now seven.]

> wave e-remover at tube
/We reset the device to e. There is a [a-z \-]+, and the tube turns into a tub. Now a handsome, giant-sized tub with RESTORATION GEL prominently emblazoned on the front.

> open tub
We open the tub, revealing some restoration gel.

> get ale
/We (take|get|pick up|acquire) the ale. A delicious nutbrown ale in a cool glass.

> go to church garden
/(We |We have a (brief|quick|short) |We make the( brief| quick| short)? |It's a( brief| quick| short)? )(walk|hike) (among the (crowds|booths of the fair)|pushing through the dense crowds). 

Church Garden
One might expect a graveyard, but burial inside the city walls has been forbidden for sanitation reasons since well before the New Church was built. Instead, there is a small meditation garden, which was once designed as an intricate knotwork of shrubs.

The knotwork has since grown into a thicket. 

> wave h-remover at thicket
We reset the device to h. The thicket abruptly shrivels and flattens itself, and in its place a ticket flutters to earth.

> get all
/ticket: We (take|get|pick up|acquire) the ticket. It reads ADMIT ONE in large black letters.

> go to hostel
/(We |We have a (healthy|fair) |We make the( fair| healthy)? |It's a( fair| healthy)? )(walk|hike) (among the (crowds|booths of the fair)|pushing through the dense crowds). 

Hostel
I take it this is where you stayed from the time you got to town until our operation. I would have expected that someone with your credentials would have been able to afford something better: The Fleur d'Or, maybe? But maybe you thought this was lower-profile. At least it's clean and doesn't smell funny.

The desk attendant is sort of eying us. She doesn't recognize you — us — but that's a good thing, I think.

Discarded in one corner is Guidebook to Anglophone Atlantis. 

There's a spiral staircase that leads up to the dormitory rooms.

> up

Dormitory Room
Painted off-white, with hard wood floors under many layers of protective gloss coating: there are no surfaces in this room that would take a stain. Four dorm beds are lined up against the wall.

The locker you identify as your own sits near one of the beds, still locked with its dial lock.  

A girl of about 19 is standing in the middle of the room, looking around as though she can't quite believe where she landed or what she's doing here. She is carrying a heavy pack and wearing a pink t-shirt. 

"Hey," says the girl. "Do you think this place is safe?" she asks conspiratorially.

I must look blank, because she goes on, "I saw this documentary once, right, about a serial killer who went from youth hostel to youth hostel, grooming girls and killing them. And then he'd chop up the bodies and put the body parts into the lockers. And no one would find out until he'd gone away again."

Nothing like that has happened around here, but she seems to get a charge out of scaring herself with this story.

/(We could|I'd like to|We want to|I'm inclined to|My response would be to) ask for privacy.

> x lock
It's curious, now you look at it: it's a combination lock with a dial face, but no one has bothered putting any numerals onto the dial.

/(Something makes you think|You have a fleeting thought|You are reminded) of making your lock.

[MEMORIES will list your currently active memories]
> show arm to girl
/("(Check this out,|What do you make of this?|Here, have a look a this)" we (say|ask)(, (holding out|showing off)|We draw the backpacking girl's attention to) the arm( for inspection)?)?.

/The backpacking girl (turns white|goes a bit green). After a moment to regain her composure, she flees the vicinity.

> gel lock
We dip out a pea-sized quantity of gel and rub it gently onto the lock. With an audible SPLORT, the lock becomes a broken clock and falls to the ground. It appears to be one of those archetypal alarm clocks that crows at sunrise and generally makes a nuisance of itself. It shows the time to be about twenty past nine.

I'm starting to understand how you got into all the places you got into. Not that I judge you or your line of work, of course. 

[Your score has gone up by one point and is now eight.]

> open locker
Now that the lock has been removed, the locker swings easily open, revealing a roll, a letter, and some plans.

[Your score has gone up by three points and is now eleven.]

> get all from locker
/roll: We (take|get|pick up|acquire) the roll.
/letter: We (take|get|pick up|acquire) the letter.
/plans: We (take|get|pick up|acquire) the plans.

> wave l-remover at plans
/We reset the device to l. There is a [a-z \-]+, and the plans turn into some pans. A set of flat skillets in cast iron: extremely bulky and heavy.

We can't reasonably carry the whole stack of pans, so they fall to the ground with a dramatic crash.

> wave s-remover at pans
/We reset the device to s. There is a [a-z \-]+, and the pans turn into a pan. An omelet-sized skillet in cast iron.

> go to cinema
/(We |We have a (healthy|fair|short) |We make the( fair| healthy| short)? |It's a( fair| healthy| short)? )(walk|hike) (among the (crowds|booths of the fair)|pushing through the dense crowds).

Cinema Lobby
This is a small, one-screen theater. The seats are not comfortable and the screen is not large. The projector is old. The management is lazy. No food is served.

On two occasions, the film I was watching burst into flames while it was being shown.

Despite these handicaps, it maintains an active and interested clientele simply by virtue of content: a wide variety of foreign films that, though meticulously dubbed into flawless California-accented English, nonetheless carry that slight tang of the forbidden.

Evidently the next showing is not for a little while yet, because there are no patrons in sight.

"Ticket," says the ticket-taker automatically.

> give ticket
(the ticket to the ticket-taker)
"Here, have a ticket," we say.

The ticket-taker frowns slightly as he takes the ticket. He turns it over front and back; looks at us in confusion; looks at the ticket again. Then he goes to the phone and makes a call.

I'm nervous. It's evident that he's talking to his manager. He doesn't take his eyes off us for a moment. He puts his hand over the mouth of the receiver so that we can't hear the whole conversation clearly, but the gist is still obvious: "...be fake... but... a TRICKET maybe? or, like, a STICKET? ...oh, all right."

Finally he hangs up.

"Sorry for the inconvenience," he says. "Your ticket looks a little different from our usual ones, but I guess the printing has been changed."

He tears the ticket briskly into confetti, destroying all evidence of our crime, and points off to the west. "The screening room is that way. Thank you and enjoy the show. It's not for a while, though."

> w

Screening Room
Whatever is scheduled for later showing has not started yet, and is probably not destined to start for some time; at any rate, the screen is blank and no audience has yet assembled.

My backpack is stowed under a seat in the third row from the back. I figured that it would be undisturbed there for a couple of hours, in the dark and out of sight, and if anyone found it they would probably turn it in to Lost and Found. But it is a big relief to find it still there.

There are a flash drive and a monocle in the backpack. 

We can go north and east to the Cinema Lobby from here.

> get all
/backpack: We (take|get|pick up|acquire) the backpack. Mine: a little bit worn, but capacious. It doesn't have any identifying marks on it, and I thought a brand-new bag would look more suspicious. It's closed.

[Your score has gone up by three points and is now fourteen.]

> open pack
We open the backpack.

> wear monocle
Everything turns computer-monitor green when viewed through our right eye. And staring fixedly at anything will turn up its authenticity status.

> go to patriotic chard-garden
/We( have a rather tiring)? walk from the kitschy splendor of the fair along the old walls and into the placid sunlight among the villas of the rich. 

Patriotic Chard-Garden
A narrow strip of land between the house and the edge of my parents' property. The eastern edge runs right up to the decaying old wall of the city, which here means some stumpy masonry on this side and a dizzying drop on the other.

The rest of their terraces and gardens are fenced off.

A little chard still grows in the nearest bed, carefully tended to thrive in this climate. 

Because it's so linguistically productive, chard is something of a national symbol; and during the world wars, there was a fad of gardening at home. After the war, it became common for affluent people with a little bit of land to keep their garden, so that if you were down on your luck you could glean a few leaves.

> get chard
We pick the chard, leaving bare soil behind.

A flicker of curtains from inside the house suggests that someone saw us — a cleaner, possibly. But then there is a voice, not audible except as a confident rising and falling tone; this will be my mother, saying not to worry and not to interfere.

> look

The rest of their terraces and gardens are fenced off.

At our feet is a patch of soil. 

> wave s-remover at soil
With a distinct whiff of mechanics and the summer time, the soil turns into some oil. A can of what appears to be motor oil. It is sludgy and black.

There is a dismissive blatt from the monocle, and transposed over the oil is a faint, greenish image of some soil.

> get oil
/We (take|get|pick up|acquire) the oil.

> go to hesychius
/(We |We have a (brief|quick|short) |We make the( brief| quick| short)? |It's a( brief| quick| short)? )(walk|hike).

Hesychius Street
As the street names make obvious, this part of town was laid out in a different political age, when it was considered more important to commemorate linguistic richness than to standardize practices.

This is also the edge of the richest part of town, with houses — really, almost villas — that were built for households with servants. My parents' place is just a block or two north of here.

On holidays like today, this street is often host to a farmer's market; though it is now late enough in the day that most of the farmers have given up and gone home, taking with them their twenty-three varieties of pickled olives, their loganberry jam, and their pigs'-feet-in-aspic.

One remaining farmer lazes here, watching his stall.

> buy yam
/We (greet|say hi to) the farmer.

The farmer makes a little cluck sound which seems to mean that he sees us but doesn't care to waste an entire syllable on acknowledging it.

"What is for sale?" we ask.

/"(All that's left this time of day is|I got) some asparagus, a lime, and a yam," the farmer replies.

"I'll have the yam, please," we say.

"Sure thing," says the farmer.

/(We could|I'd like to|We want to|I'm inclined to|My response would be to) recommend other vegetables.

> go to close
/(We |We have a (brief|quick|short) |We make the( brief| quick| short)? |It's a( brief| quick| short)? )(walk|hike).

Roget Close
A pleasantly sheltered lane in which I learned to ride a bicycle, and where my friend Lucy used to live, before she and her parents moved off-island. Restrictions were looser even twenty years ago. Our old schoolhouse is just west of here.

If you look just north between the houses, you'll notice also the footpath down to an almost-private beach. It used to be open, but it's now gated off, and built into the gate is a chic modern sculpture. 

> put yam on spinner
We put the yam on the pedestal.

The mirror rotates in leisurely fashion, and when it is done there is a May.

This is the sheet for the month of May, torn from a calendar. Someone has put a gold star on the 21st, and "Dinner with the Shaplys" is penciled onto the 30th.

There is a dismissive blatt from the monocle, and transposed over the May is a faint, greenish image of a yam.

The gate clicks open. 

[Your score has gone up by one point and is now fifteen.]

> go to beach
We walk through the wealthy neighborhood to Roget Close. There we slip between the houses and down a path that looks as though it might lead to someone's back yard. No one has ever put up signage to correct this misapprehension because no one who lives around here is eager to encourage strangers on the private beach.

Soon, however, the footpath begins to descend purposefully towards the level of the ocean.

We continue down until there is a chink of a view of the sea. Then the path descends through a few last hairpin twists among rocks, and comes out suddenly on a little beach.

Private Beach
This is little more than a strip of fine yellow sand, perhaps twenty meters from side to side, and five from the hillside to the waterline. A little sage grows on the hillside, escaped from some garden, along with wilder plants. Above, at the top of that slope, are houses with balconies overlooking the sea, but from this angle it's impossible to see much of them, or for them (you'll have to take my word on this) to see us.

> get sage
/We (take|get|pick up|acquire) the sage. Dark green leaves furred with silver prickles.

> wave e-remover at sage
/We reset the device to e. There is a [a-z \-]+, and the sage turns into a sag. The sag comes in the form of a doll-sized house with a distinct dip in the roof.

There is a dismissive blatt from the monocle, and transposed over the sag is a faint, greenish image of some sage.

If you look just north between the houses, you'll notice also the footpath down to an almost-private beach. It used to be open, but it's now gated off, and built into the gate is a chic modern sculpture. 

On the pedestal, a May revolves idly. After the mirror does its work, there is a yam.

A yam with whitish skin. Some of the dirt of the farm still adheres to it.

The monocle pings happily as we sight the yam with the crosshairs.



The mirror rotates in leisurely fashion, and when it is done there is a May.

Webster Court
A broad and plainly-paved court.

Lending its name to the location is a bronze statue of Noah Webster. My mother likes to irritate my father by quoting what his contemporaries called Webster: a "viper", a "maniacal pedant", and (always a favorite at Reform Day parties) "a toad in the service of sans-culottism". She makes sure to pronounce that in the most Parisian accent possible.

The large building just to the north — yes, the one in pale pink — is my parents' home. I think I mentioned that my parents were well off. My father works for the Bureau, embarrassingly, and my mother was born into the kind of money that we like to pretend doesn't exist on this island.

The streets continue south, east, and west; and just to the northeast is my parents' side garden.


Webster Court
A broad and plainly-paved court, named for the statue of Noah Webster.

The streets continue south, east, and west; and just to the northeast is my parents' side garden.

The door to my parents' house opens and my father comes out. He's talking over his shoulder: "Sorry, dear, but someone has to be on call."

My mother answers from inside, but we can't make out what she's saying.

"Surge on the grid," Father replies. "Could be an unauthorized synthesizer, but more likely... yes, exactly. I'll try to be home before the fireworks."

He closes the door behind him.

Hastily I take off our monocle and palm it. Father shouldn't recognize us in our current body, but wearing expensive Bureau equipment in his presence would be a terrible idea.

We put the monocle into the backpack.

> z
We hold our breath.

My father sees us from a distance and gives a neighborly wave. "Happy Punctuating!" he shouts.

I wave back rather weakly.

He gets on his small red scooter, checks his helmet, and revs off to the south. Off, apparently, to investigate the synthesizer that put us together. That will go slowly because of the holiday, but I'm guessing there will be Bureau investigators crawling all over the south side of old town in an hour or two.

/(We |We have a (brief|short|quick) |We make the( brief| short| quick)? |It's a( brief| short |quick)? )(walk|hike) out of the cocooning silence of the wealthy streets and back among the fair booths. 

High Street
Hustle, bustle, dirt; ugly American chain shops; lots and lots of people. There seems to be a large organized protest in progress: protesters completely cram the sidewalk to the southeast.

The curb is lined with garbage. 

To the west, the street turns into a monumental staircase leading to the old fortified area; a cross street heads southeast towards the main roundabout.


Achievement accomplished: Finished tutorial mode!
From a loudspeaker nearby comes the electronic sound of simulated bells ringing the hour after noon. It's later than I thought. We'd better get a move on.

> wave h-remover at chard
We reset the device to h. With a distinct whiff of crisp, snappy cardboard, the chard turns into a card. Not a playing card, as I might have expected, or a calling card, or even an index card, but a Tarot card, representing the Chariot. The vehicle is drawn by two prize horses, one black, one white. The driver appears to be having some difficulty keeping them together, to judge from the surly expression and the raised whip.

> wave d-remover at card
We reset the device to d. With a distinct whiff of metal parts and oil, the card turns into a car. It is little larger than a toy, but that is what you want when driving on the streets around here. Any substantial vehicle wouldn't fit down the winding drives.

Here is how my mother gets around. She takes a 300 Euro Hermès scarf with an orange border and a pattern of prancing horses. She tosses it in the air. As it falls, she shoots it twice, like a clay pigeon: once to take out the F, the second time for the S. And such a car: buttery leather seats, jaguar lines. If someone asks how she gets such good results, she jokes that it's because of her quality materials.

Suffice it to say that we are not similarly blessed.

The car is far too large for us to carry, and falls onto the ground.

I deeply fear automotive maintenance, but I can (just) manage to pour in the fuel... and I think that's done it.

[Your score has gone up by three points and is now eighteen.]

> wave b-remover at garbage
/We reset the device to b. There is a [a-z \-]+, and the garbage turns into a garage. It is a small but well-furnished garage for minor tuneups and repairs. It even comes with a mechanic: a surprising touch, since letter-removers are usually legally prevented from creating living persons, but sometimes there are glitches if the people are not created directly.

The mechanic nods at us.

He has the somewhat cow-like expression of all fake people, but he nods gravely and has a look. "It hasn't been maintained," he says, on inspection. "You got any motor oil?"

> give oil to mechanic
"Will this work?" We hold out the oil.

"Should do," he says. Rolling up his sleeves, he goes to work on the car. There is no small amount of banging and muttering, but finally he stands back and announces that he believes it is now in working condition.

> go to counterfeit monkey
We open the car door: perhaps unsurprisingly, it comes without an effective lock system.

We get into the car.

We close the car door.

We switch on the ignition and the car comes to life. Smelly, trembling, putt-putting life, but still, not bad for something we conjured out of a vegetable picked outside my parents' place.

Fish Market
Not very fishy at the moment, in fact: all the real trade happens in the early morning; then there is a period of tourist trade when the seafood sale tails off and most of the purchases are of polished conch shells and starfish; and then a little after noon the area clears out completely, leaving only briny rivulets on the concrete.

A tall, stern woman is standing in the middle of the market. She wears the black caped uniform of an Authenticator, and a monocle just like mine. And I don't think I want her to see us. 

Just east of here is a rusting corrugated tin building, which was built to house various possessions of the fishermen. 

[Your score has gone up by five points and is now twenty-six.]

> e
While the Authenticator's back is turned, we slip inside...

Tin Hut
Most of the light in here comes from circular windows punched into the tin walls just under the ceiling. From the inside, the building looks both larger and more sound than it appears from outside: there are plenty of sturdy struts supporting the roof and keeping the walls upright.

Various tarpaulin-covered masses fill the room. 

A trap door is set in the floor. 

Sometimes smugglers and forgers have been known to stash things in here, since the building is close to the docks but rarely attracts the interest of customs officials.

I don't think there's anything showing that should get us into trouble. Timidly we open the door; the Authenticator has her back to us. We slip out. She makes one more turn in place — monocled gaze sliding across us without stopping — and then she strides away to the north.

It takes a minute for us to adjust to the light in here. Built when people were a bit shorter and ceilings were a bit lower, the Counterfeit Monkey is always smoky and never well lit, even in the middle of the day.

...and... Slango is not here.

This is bad. Even I can see this is bad. What happened to your confidence in your team? Where are the guys who are supposed to get us out of here?

Something must have gone wrong.

Outdoor Café
From this slightly raised terrace, tourists have a view of the activity in the market and out over the docks.

Curiously, there's an acquaintance of yours here: Nexami Engeo is at one of the round black metal tables. He's a musician, the front man of engeo. Your gang helped him out with some customs issues because of his unusual name.

Nexami nods to us. "Watch out. That table next to you has something sticky spilled on it." And indeed there is a spill. You were about to lean on it nonchalantly.

Nexami Engeo is at one of the round black metal tables. Someone has left a spill on another.

"Nice clean-up method," Nexami Engeo comments. "Beats using a rag." At least, I think that's what he said.

He stands up and mutters something. I have a little trouble with his Scottish accent — we don't get a lot of that around here, for obvious reasons — but you interpret it as him saying he'd better go pay up.

He heads into the interior of the café.

Counterfeit Monkey
Infamously this pub was raided in 1929, the year that the Bureau developed its first meager attempt at an Authentication Scope, and dozens of smugglers and fraudulent businessmen went to jail. But neither that raid nor subsequent scrutiny has ever shut the place down entirely. Built when people were a bit shorter and ceilings were a bit lower, the Counterfeit Monkey is always smoky and never well lit, even in the middle of the day.

The clientele are currently engaged in a game of darts, while the barman watches and practices a sarcastic wit on those who embarrass themselves. There is also a quantity of Origin Paste sitting out on the bar. 

Parker acknowledges our return with a nod.

/(We could|I'd like to|We want to|I'm inclined to|My response would be to) ask whether he has seen Slango or ask whether we can have the origin paste.

"I wonder whether you've seen an associate of mine," we say to Parker. "Name of Slango."

Parker looks over the bar at us. "He comes in here from time to time," he says. "Very regular customer. Always has about three rum and cokes." 

This is a lie, and therefore a test. Slango doesn't drink alcohol himself and doesn't permit drunkenness in his crew.

/(We could|I'd like to|We want to|I'm inclined to|My response would be to) challenge Parker about the rum.

> challenge parker about the rum
"Must be a different Slango," we say. "Mine is more of a root beer man. Thanks anyway though."

"Oh, that Slango," Parker says. "He's been around town the last couple of days, but not today. If you know his lady friend, you might try her." 

Lady friend? This can only mean Lena, she being the only female native with whom Slango spends much time socially. But you wouldn't have guessed that she'd advanced to the status of lady friend. Either way, Lena is a rather odd woman who keeps a used bookstore off Deep Street.

/(We could|I'd like to|We want to|I'm inclined to|My response would be to) ask whether we can have the origin paste.

> ask about paste
"That Origin Paste for sale?" 

"Well now," he says, grinning, "that would surely be illegal, would it not? Origin Paste is after all a controlled substance in this country, due to its unhappy association with fraudulent activities. On the other hand there is no law against someone winning the Origin Paste in a completely legitimate game of chance or skill."

/(We could|I'd like to|We want to|I'm inclined to|My response would be to) ask how one might go about winning.

"Explain this game as though I have no idea what you're talking about," you say, leaning on the bar in an interested fashion. Are you flirting with Parker? No? Okay. Good to know.

"It's a designated challenge game," says Parker. You've seen this played before, but he explains the rules anyway. 

"There are two contestants, one challenger and one defender.

"The challenger chooses any object he likes and shows it to the moderator ahead of time.

"The defender, without seeing the object, stipulates a general category. The challenger has five minutes to turn his designated object into an item that fits the defender's category, or he forfeits his ante."

"I'd like to play that," we say.

"Excellent. Oh, I did mention the small matter of the entry fee?"

I get out the roll of bills and he peels off two twenties.

"Thank you. Now, you pick your entry article, and I'll ask one of these good gentlemen to suggest a defense category."

> show sill to barman
"Right," says the barman. "The sill it is." 

He turns towards the group assembled around the dartboard. "Anyone want to defend against this character?" (with a nod at you). 

"Something smaller than a pebble!" suggests a woman in the front row. She passes forward her own ante to the bar, and the game is on.

We dip out a pea-sized quantity of gel and rub it gently onto the sill. With an audible SPLORT, the sill becomes a spill.

"A winner!" says the barman, straightening up. "What do you know? The Origin Paste is all yours, darling."

This produces a squawk of surprise and irritation from the defendant, and you get the impression that this game has been agreeably fleecing tourists all day. Pity you had to come along and spoil it.

Tin Hut
Most of the light in here comes from circular windows punched into the tin walls just under the ceiling. From the inside, the building looks both larger and more sound than it appears from outside: there are plenty of sturdy struts supporting the roof and keeping the walls upright.

Various tarpaulin-covered masses fill the room. 

A trap door is set in the floor.

Crawlspace
An awkward, low, concrete-lined crawlspace beneath the tin hut. It smells somewhat like animals; in spite of this it clearly gets a bit more use than anyone would like the customs officials to know about.

The trap door, wedged open by a sill, admits the only light.

The only significant thing down here is a crate.

Aquarium Bookstore
The shop takes its name from the collection of fish mounted on every wall: swordfish, bass, other things I don't recognize. Underneath these dubious tokens, the walls are covered with bookshelves, and there are stacks of books on the floor where the shelves have proven insufficient.

The merchandise consists mainly, but not exclusively, of books, and the selection caters to odd tastes. You once picked up in here a book about a man who R-removed a wrench, and then had his way with it. You and Brock had a good time with that one for the next month and a half.

Lena is present, all right. In fact she watches us keenly the instant we come into the shop. Lena is an associate of Slango's. You hadn't realized that had crossed over into a romance. Slango has never, ever in your recollection dated anyone. And now this.

"Happy Serial Comma Day," she says.

"Glad to see you've got plenty of origin paste," Lena remarks. "It's such a useful thing to have. Smells so nice."

/(We could|I'd like to|We want to|I'm inclined to|My response would be to) ask whether she has seen Slango or say who we are.

> ask whether
"You wouldn't happen to have seen Slango about recently?" we ask.

"Slango?" she asks blankly, for all the world as though she'd had a lobotomy. "Is that a board game?"

/(We could|I'd like to|We want to|I'm inclined to|My response would be to) say who we are.

> say who
"Lena, it's Andra. And company. Maybe Slango mentioned that I was auditioning a new silent partner."

"I don't know what you're talking about," she says. "But since you're here, whoever you are, I wonder whether you'd like to have a look at some merchandise of mine that could use a spruce." 

Aha. She wants us to prove our identity; probably has contraband that needs concealing, and wants us to do the deed as proof of trustworthiness.

There's a brief pause.

Lena goes off into a corner and rummages among the suspicious piles of books, and uncovers a box. "C'mere," she says; and obediently I wander over to that area of the store, which incidentally happens to be tucked away and half-hidden by shelves.

"See here," she says. "See what you can do with it, eh?"

> x contraband
It's just a cardboard box in which some items of interest have been stored.

In the contraband box are some modems and some preamps.

Lena apparently wants our help getting them into a less identifiable format.

> wave m-remover at modems
We reset the device to m. With a distinct whiff of old book, the modems turn into some odes. A slender volume of poetry, bound between red covers. It looks completely harmless and is written in English.

The blurb on the back describes it as a "collection of meditations" on Atlantis' imaginary roots, which is to say, a lot of stuff about magic-wielding Phoenicians, Knights Templar, refugees from the Tower of Babel, space aliens, cabalistic mysticism, and Lully's combinatorics.

It fits in perfectly with the rest of Lena's selection. Really amazing work. I've seen other people who were able to do impressive things with local field distortions — think hard enough and you can prejudice the outcome of a linguistic transition.

But this... this is detail work like I haven't seen. My hat is off.

Or would be if I were wearing a hat and taking it off didn't mean making you take it off too.

Lena touches the binding appreciatively. "You've even got that little bit of creasing in the spine that makes it look used," she says. "This is perfect. Only risk is customers wanting to buy it. I've got a couple this would be right up their alley."

> wave s-remover at odes
We reset the device to s. With a distinct whiff of paper, the odes turn into an ode. A short poem, letter-pressed attractively on a sheet of thick paper. It is entitled "Our Ancestors, The Immortal Spirits of the Pyramids," a fact which disinclines me to study the rest.

"Well, it's portable, and it doesn't look like much, but then again, it doesn't look like much. I mean, I could easily lose it, couldn't I? Just one sheet. And if someone were to ask me why I was carrying it around that would be a little hard to explain. It's not like it's a whole book of 'em, is it?"

/(We could|I'd like to|We want to|I'm inclined to|My response would be to) calm Lena.

We reset the device to m. The modems give way to the now-familiar odes.

"I'm looking forward to what you do with the preamps," Lena says. "They should look... innocent."

/We reset the device to s. There is a [a-z \-]+, and the preamps turn into a preamp. It looks like just one specimen from the group from which you were working.

"I was hoping you'd make the preamp look less like electronics," she offers, evidently forgetting the fake off-handedness with which she started this transaction.

/(We could|I'd like to|We want to|I'm inclined to|My response would be to) calm Lena.

> wave p-remover at preamp
/We reset the device to p. There is a [a-z \-]+, and the preamp turns into a ream. One ream, which is to say 500 sheets, of generic printer or copier paper, in white-white.

"That works. Kind of thing I might have around for printing invoices on. I was a little afraid there you were going to go for a ram just to spite me. Don't know where I'd put one of those around here."

> put paste on ream
We smear some of the Origin Paste onto the ream. Nothing obvious happens, of course, but that is the whole point.

"Nice monocle, by the way! You do have all the good toys. Suppose it means you can check your work and see whether you've really got enough paste on things."

> ask whether
"Now, you owe me one Slango," you say. "Where'd he get to?"

"Slango and I were catching up. Bless that man, he's hung like a yak," she says. "But he got bad news and had to hurry back to the yacht. Said something about not being able to keep an appointment. I take it you're the appointment? I can try reaching him for you, if you want."

/(We could|I'd like to|We want to|I'm inclined to|My response would be to) encourage Lena to contact Slango.

> encourage lena
"That would be extremely helpful," we say. Perhaps we can finally get off this island and back into our separate skins, which would not be one minute too soon for me.

/"Very good," she says. She goes over to one of the free-standing shelves and takes out copies of [A-Za-z' ]+. Behind these works of literature she finds what looks like a cellular phone; but it mustn't be one, or at least not of the usual variety, because the Bureau tightly controls such items. 

We hear half a conversation. "It's me. There's someone to see... yes, I had her do the contraband... I don't know, a little taller and a lot less mean... Oh! I see. She looks healthy enough... I'm not running a restaurant! Okay. Okay. I'll talk to you later, sweetie. Bye." 

Without meeting our eye, she buries the phone back in its previous location. Then she says, "He's coming in direct. He says go over to Counterfeit Monkey and he'll be right over as originally planned, and he's sorry about the wait."

"Oh! And." She tosses us a coin. "Have a drink on me."

/(We could|I'd like to|We want to|I'm inclined to|My response would be to) thank Lena.

"This would be a good time to stop for lunch and a little siesta," says Lena, following us to the door. As we go out, she's rolling down the shades and putting up a closed sign.

Counterfeit Monkey
Built when people were a bit shorter and ceilings were a bit lower, the Counterfeit Monkey is always smoky and never well lit, even in the middle of the day.

Slango sits at a dark table, nursing a root beer. Slango is, of course, not Slango's real name. He is half criminal, half ideological revolutionary: uncouth, restless, always hungry for a new exploit. Had he been born into a freer society, he might have become a very valuable engineer or consultant. He has been your mentor in crime and your usher into the world of adults.

Slango meets our eye for a long minute without smiling.

/(We could|I'd like to|We want to|I'm inclined to|My response would be to) say who we are.

> x slango
He's dressed plainly but neatly: clean jeans, crisp white button-up shirt. His face is calm and his voice is even and he could be any age between thirty and fifty. He looked that way when you met him eight years ago, too.

> say who
"Slango," you say. "Lena gave me a totally unwanted visual about your yaklike proportions. Guess you also got a yak's sense of clock time?"

"It was an emergency. I figured you'd go to Lena, and I was right."

"You were lucky. I knew her a little, but I had no idea you two were making the yak with two humps."

"No such thing as a bactrian yak," Slango replies. "My apologies. I assumed that what Brock knows, he passes on to you, and he certainly knows about me and Lena." He scowls into his root beer. "Nearly gave himself a hernia laughing," Slango adds under his breath.

/(We could|I'd like to|We want to|I'm inclined to|My response would be to) explain Brock's probable reasons or ask whether we can leave now.

"She's old enough to be your spinster aunt and flaky enough to tell your fortune with half a tarot deck and a couple of Uno cards," you say. "We haven't got a lot of clues about what your type is, but I doubt Brock would have guessed Lena."

"She's thirty-two," says Slango crisply. "She runs Radio Free Atlantida single-handed with electronics she built herself. And if she were old enough to be my spinster aunt, that would still be my business."

"So, uh, I guess you guys are pretty serious, then," you say.

"I'd give her and me better odds than you and Brock."

/(We could|I'd like to|We want to|I'm inclined to|My response would be to) mutter darkly or ask whether we can leave now.

"Brock's run into a little trouble pursuing a profitable opportunity."

/(We could|I'd like to|We want to|I'm inclined to|My response would be to) ask what the trouble was.

"Define trouble."

"I had a pick-up arranged to get him off the island shore all the way down by Maiana last night, but he didn't make it, and sent no messages. I checked a contact in Bureau Processing, but no arrest file has gone through, so Brock hasn't been caught. He's just... missing."

/(Raised voices near the bar interrupt you for a moment.|Over the voices of the crowd comes the sound of the barman setting out another round.)?

"We can't leave without Brock," Slango says, as though you needed persuading.

Or maybe he's saying that to the me half of us. Right now, it's true that I'm not keen on the prospect of hanging out in Atlantis. We're already way behind the plan.

/(We could|I'd like to|We want to|I'm inclined to|My response would be to) complain about the inefficiency of this scheme.

Sorry, but I have to get this out there. "I was really expecting a smoother escape plan when I arranged to work with your operation," I say.

Slango eyes us with disfavor. "Andra, you got a moron up in your head. Kid — Alex — we aren't travel agents."

/(Raised voices near the bar interrupt you for a moment.|Over the voices of the crowd comes the sound of the barman setting out another round.)?

"I've got to get back to the yacht; it's empty," Slango says. "And I would prefer not to let the Bureau get a good look at me, while your current face is, shall we say, disposable. The trick is, we don't know where Brock is. If he left a message for us, it'll be at the dead drop."

That's a spot at the public convenience by the town bus station where the three of you leave messages for one another when necessary. Usually quiet, yet anonymous. "We're on it," we say.

"Glad to hear it," says Slango. "Now stop referring to yourself as 'we' in company."

This gives us something to go on, anyway. We give Slango what I intend as a reassuring nod of solidarity.

"Back to the yacht for me," Slango says. "Don't let the other half of your head do anything you wouldn't do."

"Which of us are you talking to?" I ask smartly.

"Both."

He heads out towards the docks and quickly disappears from view — returning to the yacht to wait for us to arrive with Brock.

Docks
Here are some dozens of boats tied up: some of them are small to medium-sized fishing craft, some tourist boats for trips around the island, some merely ferries to the deeper harbor where the cruise ships anchor.

To the east, up a moderate rise from the sea-level docks, is the imposing exterior of the Customs House. The classical look is only a little undermined by the public-service posters along the front. There passports are inspected and cargo passed under authentication, foreign items renamed or confiscated, and suspected smugglers interrogated.

Immediately west, the Counterfeit Monkey's sign sways in the wind.

/(We |We have a (brief|quick) |We make the( brief| quick)? |It's a( brief| quick)? )drive through the marina district( over)? to the Roundabout. 

The whole Roundabout has ground to a halt, with protesters walking in the street and in some places completely filling the road. But this is mostly a nuisance until I notice that there are a couple of teenagers handcuffed to a tree.

I give the wheel a yank and run the car up onto the central traffic circle a little way. Call it a parking job. We need to get those kids out of here before their arrest is processed and they go to storage. I might not have the nerve to do anything by myself, but you're with me, and I'm starting to appreciate that's like being Batman.


Traffic Circle (jammed into the car)
Normally no pedestrian ever comes to this circle of grass and litter: the flow of traffic is too constant and too fast. But the protest has stopped the traffic and I'm determined to do something about the two teenagers I saw just now, so here we are. Though we probably have to get out of the car if we're going to be useful.

I can see an officer making his way between the cars and stopping at the fake ones. Maybe we'd better conceal our car before we leave it — we may need to make a quick getaway later.

We swing the car door open.

We climb out of the car.

"Go ahead, put us in Cold Storage!" shouts the defiant teenager. "I'm happy to sleep through all this shit and wake up when we have jet packs and a government that respects the rights of its people."

The All-Purpose Officer shifts the restoration gel rifle from one hand to another; looks around; and then props it against the foot of the statue.

> z
Time passes.

The nervous teenager looks unhappy. "We won't get out of here until our families are all dead and global warming has reduced Atlantis to three square feet of hilltop."

The All-Purpose Officer goes around to the back of the statue and begins to climb up the leg, finding footholds in the folds of Atlantida's gown. It looks like a precarious business, but he's determined.

> get rifle
/We (take|get|pick up|acquire) the rifle. It fits well in your hand: good heft. I feel like we know how to aim this thing. It's illegal to carry, but that doesn't seem to be bothering you right now.

The nervous teenager struggles against her bonds.

Gritting his teeth, the All-Purpose Officer climbs for access out onto Atlantida's huge metal arm. It looks about as sturdy as a substantial tree branch, but more slippery, and inconveniently angled.

> shoot tree
(with the restoration gel rifle)
We shoot the restoration gel rifle at the brown tree. With an audible SPLORT, the brown tree becomes a brown tee. It's a brown wooden peg for putting a golf ball on. Apparently the All-Purpose Officer performed a little light R-insertion when he found himself in need of a portable tree.

Freed from attachment to the tree, the teenagers look at each other and then run off into the crowd.

The All-Purpose Officer glances around, but you've made us stand so our body conceals the rifle from his angle. He growls in annoyance. "Station," he says, apparently to thin air. "I need back-up."

Understood, says a tinny distant voice.

Once the All-Purpose Officer comes level with the sign, he shoots it with the diminutive affixer, turning it into a signet. It's an outsized signet bearing the crest of the Bureau of Orthography, now hanging around the statue's neck in the same way that the sign did a moment ago.

> drop rifle
We prop the rifle back at the foot of the statue.

The crowd is parting. We might be able to leave soon.

Laboriously and with obvious irritation, the All-Purpose Officer pries the arms of the stuffed octopus off the statue's wrist, where they appear to have been fixed with glue.

> enter car
We get into the car.

No one seems to be much the wiser about what just happened. I have to say, you know what you're doing. Traffic is starting to move again. We'd better get on to the dead drop.

Roundabout (jammed into the car)
We are jammed into the car with our knees almost at our chin, looking out through the bulbous little windshield.

The traffic flows in a tight circle around a statue which we know all too well.

Confusing signs point in various directions: northeast to Deep Street, northwest to High Street, south to Long Street, east to Tall Street.

/(They're honking at us for a reason, you know.)?

My apartment is that direction, but unless we have some reason to go there, it seems least suspicious to avoid my old neighborhood.

Public Convenience
There are just the two toilet stalls and a couple of sinks, but the place has been kept up reasonably well, if one doesn't count the graffiti.

A soap dispenser hangs beside the mirror. 

About knee-height in one of the stalls is a hole that runs right through the wall between the men's and women's restrooms. It's here that you and Brock and Slango usually leave things for one another.

A faint smell of lavender lingers in the air.

Rotunda
Echoing space, marble floor, eye-like skylight many meters above us: so far, the Rotunda might belong to any 19th-century government bureau of means and self-importance.

What sets this one apart is the lettering, each sigil no bigger than a flea, carved over every inch of the walls. Inscribed here is, in fact, the entire text of A New Orthodox Orthography, which means that if we had a great deal of patience and many rolls of butcher paper, we could take rubbings and wind up with our very own volume.

We don't, of course. There are better things to do. More important places to go. The administrative part of the bureau is away to the south, and there is an exhibit of letter tools to the east, which is open to the public.

/Near the street entrance is a sizable informational bulletin-board advertising the services of the Bureau; and next to this, pushed back to be out of the way, is a bin. (The bin contains a shuttle|There is a shuttle in the bin).

We show the appointment card, and are let in.

Arbot Maps & Antiques
There is a large collection of vintage and antique maps under glass — the island of Atlantis as a whole, street maps of here and of Maiana, navigation maps of the harbor, and then maps of more distant places as well. 

A stylish mannequin near the front sports a pair of Britishizing goggles. 

Overseeing all this is a woman named Kate. 

"Welcome to Arbot," says Kate. "Feel free to browse and ask me any questions you may have about the merchandise."

/(We could|I'd like to|We want to|I'm inclined to|My response would be to) ask whether she has seen Brock.

> x maps
We study the maps. One in the collection stands out: a map of Slangovia, framed like all the others but of suspiciously recent vintage.

> get slangovia map
Kate is watching us; I think we'd best buy anything we need here, rather than trying to filch it.

/(We could|I'd like to|We want to|I'm inclined to|My response would be to) ask whether she has seen Brock.

> buy slangovia map
"I'll have this map of Slangovia," we say.

"That just came in today," Kate says. "We bought it from a visiting scholar — he'd come to attend a demonstration with my boss, as a matter of fact, and happened to have this item with him."

She looks at the map dubiously for a moment. "Just between us, I've never heard of Slangovia. But as the seller was a guest of my employer, it seemed rude to quibble. And it is a very attractively drawn piece. I'm sure you'll enjoy it."

Kate removes the map from its case and packs it up carefully for us.

Fleur d'Or Drinks Club
The back wall is dramatically decorated with bottled liquors of all sorts, from gin to cachaça; there's a giant bottle of Campari, taller than your average three-year-old, with a red ribbon around its neck.

What makes this place technically a drinks club rather than a bar is its license to serve letter-manufactured food and drink. A toolkit on the bar contains some gimlets and some rusty nails, ready to be transformed into their respective cocktails.

The bartender is in the middle of showing her homonym paddle to a patron holding a gin and tonic. The other patrons are scattered around the room at small tables, drinking or talking among themselves. 

She acknowledges us with a nod as we stroll up to the bar and get close enough to hear their conversation. "It was originally produced as a toy, but it's actually a bit dangerous," the bartender is saying.

"Dangerous? How so?" asks the patron.

"Various ways," she says. "Suppose I hit a small object that has a big homonym, like say a plane. You know, the carpentry kind. Suddenly I've got an airplane-style plane on top of me."

> show legend to bartender
/"(Check this out,|What do you make of this\?|Here, have a look a this)" we (say|ask)(, (holding out|showing off) the legend( for inspection)?)?.

"This?" she says, looking a little surprised. "You want it converted?"

"Why not?"

"No reason," she says. "Just I did the same item a few hours ago for a gentleman. Really hot, with these amazing eyes-"

"Whatever," you say, before she can get any more excited about Brock.

She smirks. Then she taps the legend with her paddle and it transforms into a proper map legend.

"What if you hit something that doesn't mean anything else?" the patron asks. "Like a chicken?"

"Nothing," she says. "That's safe." As though to demonstrate, she smacks the paddle against her left buttock. "See? I don't get changed into a different bartender. Want to try?"

She holds up the paddle as though she's going to tap him with it.

"Uh... my name is Mark," he says.

"Maybe not, then!" she says, laughing brightly.

[Your score has gone up by one point and is now forty-two.]

> x legend
This legend has been edited from its original form, replacing the words like HOSPITAL and RESTROOM with other, hand-written labels: INVITE, GOT, 11, OUT, T-INSERTER, etc. By arranging the words of the legend in the order in which the icons appear along the main street, we arrive at GOT INVITE T-INSERTER DEMONSTRATION. OUT 11 AM.

Of course, it's already long past 11 AM, so Brock's plan clearly went wrong. If we're going to go after him, we'll have to go to the T-inserter demonstration ourselves. The catch is that, as dangerous new technology, it's held inside the Bureau and requires a special invitation to enter.

I think I know where we can get one, though. My advisor Professor Waterstone — that's the person overseeing my graduate research — was also invited to this demonstration. We might be able to get his.

Now this is my part of town: Palm Square is the beginning of the university district. To the southeast, through the iron gate, is the university campus proper; and that unobtrusive little doorway directly south of us leads into the Babel Café.

That way lies the bathroom window of my apartment. Though in fact, if you have a mind to break in, it's the easiest way: it's not hard to force the window.

> w
The window slides open with a hideous protesting shriek.

"Halt! You! Young person!"

It's my neighbor, Mrs. Parsnip, leaning out from her apartment above us. Mrs. Parsnip and I don't interact except about once a month when she comes around to ask for my spare change for bus fare or the laundry.

"Clear off or I'll call the police!" she shouts.

...No, don't worry, I'll handle this.

I step us back and stare up at her. "I'm a friend of Alex," I say. "He called and asked me to stop by because he thought he left the stove on. Said he climbs in the window all the time when he gets locked out."

"That's true," she says. "Shouldn't be allowed out by himself. Okay, go ahead."

In a mutter she adds, "Not like he has anything worth stealing anyway." She vanishes from view.

The window is uncomfortably high and it takes a little scramble to get in, but soon we are inside.

I should point out my copy of The Problem of Adjectives. I should have taken it back to the library — I meant to take it back to the library — but there just wasn't time. The last couple of hours before I came to meet you were frantic. The way I figured it, my parents or someone will come looking for me and they'll take it back for me. I think.

I'd apologize for the mess, but should we really be here? I'm reconciled to leaving all my things behind, you know. You made me promise that I didn't mind.

We're about to, when the door to the street opens and my mother walks into the room. She shuts it behind her and puts away her key before she notices us. Then she stands very still. For about a quarter second she considers calling the police, but I can see that worry passing away again as she takes in our clothing, age, and general demeanor.

"Hi there," she says, coming forward to take our hand. "I'm Mrs. Rosehip. Alex Rosehip's mother. You must be a friend of his?"

/(We could|I'd like to|We want to|I'm inclined to|My response would be to) say we're his girlfriend.

> t girlfriend
"Yes — sort of. We've been... I mean, we've been on a few dates." That's you, and I have to say you don't sound as keen on dating ourself as you might.

She raises her eyebrows. "I see. How secretive of him not to bring you around. And where is Alex now? I need to speak with him. He's been hard to reach lately."

I know you think it's a bit sketchy that my mother just walks into my apartment when I'm not around, but I swear to you she's never done that before. She must be more worried about something than she's letting on.

/(We could|I'd like to|We want to|I'm inclined to|My response would be to) claim to have seen him this morning or say we don't know.

> claim
"He went out to, ah, do some research, I think. He left before I was completely awake." (Thanks, now you've given my mother the impression that I'm a cad.)

She looks at the dissheveled futon, and her expression becomes even more unreadable. "I did think I'd taught my son better manners," she remarks. "I apologize on his behalf."

Mother picks her way to the refrigerator, which she opens, revealing only some yogurt.

"Evidently not planning to have dinner at home this evening," she comments.

/(We could|I'd like to|We want to|I'm inclined to|My response would be to) explain we might go out.

> z
She gives the refrigerator door a little push and it swings closed.

"How well do you know him?" Mother asks. She immediately catches herself, and adds: "I'm not inquiring into the details of your relationship. But I am concerned about him. He has seemed very unhappy recently about his work. Has he said anything to you about that? Wanting to leave the program, or change careers, or... anything?" 

I didn't think she'd noticed.

/(We could|I'd like to|We want to|I'm inclined to|My response would be to) reassure Mother or suggest the truth.

> reassure
"I think it's graduate school getting to him a bit," we lie. I am pretty sure this is what my mother thinks: she has little time for whining or sulking, and I believe she considers any ideological queasiness I may have exhibited to be just malingering about research that is not going well.

"Really?" she says. "Hm." 

I would like her to go on, but she doesn't: because it would be indiscreet, because she doesn't trust us.

/(Mother appears to be meditating about the [a-z ]+|Mother spaces out a bit, contemplating the [a-z ]+).

"Well," Mother says. "I had better go. If you do see Alex, tell him to call me, please. It isn't an emergency, but you can tell him there's a bit of Bureau business I'd like to discuss with him."

We nod, and suddenly it is borne in on me that this may be the last I see of my mother in a lifetime: and I'm trying to memorize the exact cut of her hair and the way her expensive Italian heels tap on the floor, and meanwhile she is going out completely indifferent to the moment. I could have stood for our previous meeting to be the last one — we had dinner and she hugged me goodbye then. This makes it all much much worse.

And you, you're nattering at me in our head, asking what she meant about the Bureau. It might be, I guess, that they've been watching me and that she got wind of it. That would be likely. But if so it doesn't matter, not any more.

She's not even visible through the window any longer.

Through many changes of management, this institution has fed the denizens of the university and ignored their semi-sedition.

A clerk in a white apron stands behind the long glass case. In the long glass case are a pocket-bread and a honey pastry triangle. 

The tables are square wooden things painted dark blue (not the vibrant blue of the Bureau, but something closer to midnight), and the upper surfaces are découpaged with antique travel postcards. 

A blue plaque is mounted on the wall.

University Oval
This is the center of the university, a broad grassy oval shaded with sycamore trees and surrounded by buildings in brick or white stone.

An activist is standing in our way, gripping a sign that says "TOXI WASTE AWARENESS!". 

Immediately south of here is the building where I spend most of my time, Samuel Johnson Hall. 

"Do you have a minute to help save the environment?" the activist asks brightly.

/(We could|I'd like to|We want to|I'm inclined to|My response would be to) say no or say yes.

> say no
"I'm sorry, I'm in a hurry," we say. 

Evidently she has a greater than usual flair for drama, because she refuses to be brushed off that easily. "You're in a hurry now," she says, "but in a few short decades, you'll be much too late. Please, for the good of your planet."

She sets down the sign in order to free her hands for more expressive argument. "Listen, we're trying to gain financial support to make a major advertising campaign pushing the concept of toxi waste throughout the anglophone world. If you know anything about linguistic efficacy, I'm sure you can imagine the implications." 

I can, in fact, imagine the implications, probably a little better than she would like.

/(We could|I'd like to|We want to|I'm inclined to|My response would be to) encourage the activist to elaborate on the implications.

"Oh?" we say neutrally. This is all it takes.

"Toxi waste would be, in concept, a completely harmless, safe, and neutral substance that would have no detrimental impact on the surrounding environment. By raising awareness of toxi waste throughout the Anglophone world, we would put the collective consciousness to work for the environment! It would then be possible for volunteer workers to convert large stocks of dangerous toxic waste into the safe, neutral toxi waste using minimal energy."

/(We could|I'd like to|We want to|I'm inclined to|My response would be to) ask how consciousness will be raised or ask how the campaign will address problems of visualization.

"And, er, how do you plan to raise awareness of toxi waste to sufficient levels to achieve linguistic efficacy?" we ask. Well, that was mostly me. But I'm curious.

"That's where people like you come in," she admits, with a sweet little smile.

/She (watches us with interest|touches our arm). "The next few months are critical to our operation," the activist says. "We need to be able to blitz multiple countries simultaneously with an intense and outrageous advertising campaign that will garner further media coverage from news sources and provoke discussion on the internet and in the workplace. But in order to do that, we need the funding to place high profile advertisements in a variety of places. That's why donations from people like yourself are going to be so very necessary."

/(We could|I'd like to|We want to|I'm inclined to|My response would be to) donate.

The activist seems to have given up on convincing us and lets us go by in peace.

Samuel Johnson Hall
This is the main building for Language Studies. This is not to be confused with Language Engineering, which is the department that handles devices for the manipulation of language-objects; it is also not to be confused with Linguistics, English Literature, or Comparative Literature, all of which have their own buildings and faculties. Language Studies applies itself to questions of linguistic efficacy chiefly at a social and anthropological level.

That's to say that we study how the ability to change things based on their names affects daily life and society.

The department office, with several professorial offices leading off of it, is to the southeast. To the southwest is the seminar room, where many of the upper-level courses occur, and which also contains the department library; downstairs is the basement, where the graduate students and junior instructors are kept.

On the wall hangs a framed photograph of Professor Waterstone, with the words SHAPLY CHAIR in big letters underneath.

Language Studies Department Office
This big, slightly drab area holds such useful objects as the mailboxes and the secretary's computer. On ordinary days the secretary would be in as well, presiding over affairs. The offices of individual professors lie north and west.

The printer also sits on the u-shaped desk. 

This corner office was won in a battle of wills with several other departments during the most recent rebuilding drive. Professor Waterstone is fond of reminding the others that he was the one to obtain this favorable position whenever there is a disagreement about procedure.

Waterstone's Office
A very finicky, neatly arranged room, in which one never feels quite at home.

Professor Waterstone is sitting here. Waterstone is my dissertation advisor. (He insists on the "o" spelling.) He's an expert in the history of linguistic and orthographical power, but he's politically kind of reactionary. "Don't meddle" is pretty much his motto.

We can see an invitation on a desk. It's from Dental Consonants Limited. Their design of stationery is unmistakable.

In front of Professor Waterstone is a small laptop. 

He looks up at us gravely. "I don't believe we've met," he says. "Can I help you?"

/(We could|I'd like to|We want to|I'm inclined to|My response would be to) make up some excuse, ask whether he met the activists, or ask why he is working on Serial Comma Day.

> ask why
"Why are you in today?" we ask. "Isn't it a holiday?"

"The pursuit of knowledge does not occur according to the calendar," he says. Then he adds, "And my wife is having the carpets shampooed and kicked me out of the house."

/(We could|I'd like to|We want to|I'm inclined to|My response would be to) ask whether he met the activists.

> ask whether
"Did you run into those activists outside?"

"Sadly, it is our misfortune constantly to encounter people with no concept of what language manipulation can and cannot do," Waterstone says. He really seems to be in a bad mood today, even for him: maybe a fight with the wife, or a nasty letter from the dean.

There's a brief pause. "Look, I really must work on this," says Waterstone, chasing us to the door. "Perhaps someone else in the department can answer a few of your questions. I believe I saw Professor Higgate earlier, and Professor Brown is usually in his lab downstairs. I'm sure he's not working on anything too urgent. Goodbye!"

The office door closes with measured firmness behind us.

Through the window in Waterstone's door, we can see him turning the lock. When he catches us watching he gives a tight, unfriendly smile and goes back to his desk.

A moment later the printer whirs thoughtfully.

I immediately notice, however, that several portions of the speech are marked with angry triple asterisks — Waterstone's way of marking up parts of text that need serious revision.

The talk concerns "homonym shame": the anxiety felt in the Victorian era, and still manifested at times in modern culture, about objects that shared the same name as (and therefore theoretically might be converted into) something rude. Methods of disguising the legs of pianos and crotches of trees occupy a good portion of Waterstone's exposition, and there is a page-long aside on methods of  making sure that donkeys are known by that name and not by the alternative.

To judge, however, from the angry asterisking, Waterstone is still looking for at least one more example of an object susceptible to double-entendre that has been successfully rendered innocent by some linguistic modification.

Higgate's office
Higgate got about 30% finished with a stylish decorating scheme and then got distracted, leaving everything in a unsettled state. A few of her books are arranged on a very nice rosewood bookshelf, which looks Asian and is ornamented with small figurines; all the rest of her library is stacked higgledy-piggledy in plastic cartons.

Professor Higgate is sitting at an oval table, on which are spread an ugly yellow book, a sugar bowl, a teapot, and a romance novel in some heavily accented language. Higgate is the second reader on my dissertation committee, and a conlang expert — that is, Constructed Languages. It was a seminar with her that really got me thinking about utopian linguistics, and she's been very supportive, though cautious. She and Professor Waterstone don't always get along that well.

She looks up when we come in. ".i xu do se bangu la lojban." Higgate asks. She's asking whether we speak Lojban. For the present, I think it will raise fewer questions if we say no.

> no
"I'm afraid I don't understand," we say, smiling faintly.

Her face falls. "Ah! I was hoping you'd be here for Conversational Lojban Tea." The room is conspicuously lacking other Lojban conversationalists.

/(We could|I'd like to|We want to|I'm inclined to|My response would be to) ask how Professor Higgate is doing.

"How are you?" we ask.

Forgive me these irrelevant questions, but I haven't seen Professor Higgate for a few days, and she's one of my favorite people in the department. I worry about her a little.

She looks taken aback, as though trying to figure out whether she knows us. Then she shrugs this off and decides to proceed as though she does.

"Oh, you know," she says. "It's that time of year when the energy's run out and the students have to be prodded with an electric rod to get them to do any work.

"What would be so bad about being director of graduate studies?" I ask, a little surprised. I always thought she liked graduate students.

"Nothing, nothing! It's just that I have this book I should be writing, and Professor Waterstone has done the job for so many years that he's—"

She pulls up short, apparently remembering that she doesn't, actually, know us at all. "He's very experienced, and I am not sure he would enjoy watching someone else do it differently," she concludes tactfully. "Our personal styles are not very similar."

There's a brief pause.

"I'd offer you some cucumber sandwiches," Professor Higgate says. "But I'm afraid I ate them all."

/(We could|I'd like to|We want to|I'm inclined to|My response would be to) ask whether she might let us into the language studies seminar room, ask how we might return a book, or ask which conlangs she knows.

> ask about seminar
"Could you possibly let me into the Language Studies Seminar Room?" we ask. "There's something I'd like to do in there."

"Er... Do you have some student ID or something? You see, and this is a little embarrassing, I'm afraid I'm not quite placing you at the moment, and I'm not supposed to allow students into that room unless they have some affiliation with the department."

Of course we don't have any ID, and no prospect of getting any. But she might be persuaded by some other evidence of affiliation.

/(We could|I'd like to|We want to|I'm inclined to|My response would be to) ask how we might return a book or ask which conlangs she knows.

> t book
"I need to return this book to the department library," we say, holding out The Problem of Adjectives.

"Oh! Yes, all right," she says. "Did you like it? It's a good overview of the subject, didn't you think? I'm afraid the author once annoyed Professor Waterstone at a conference, or we might have had her around to speak at one of our colloquia..."

Higgate stands, patting herself down as though worried she has forgotten something.

"After you," says Higgate. "I assume it's safe to leave for a minute; if anyone is coming for Lojban Tea we'll see them in the hall." She walks past us through the office door.

We walk a little behind Higgate, who has a very long businesslike stride despite her heels.

She fiddles with her keys for a moment before finding the right one. "Here we you go," she says, pushing the door open.

She steps inside.

Language Studies Seminar Room
They recently redid this room, and whoever picked the decorations had postmodern tastes.

Professor Higgate waits a little absent-mindedly nearby, looking over the bookshelf. There are History of the Standards Revolution and Lives of the Lexicographers on the bookshelf. 

/A massive plexiglas case takes up one corner of the room. (There is|The plexiglas case contains) a compact but high-powered late model synthesizer( in the plexiglas case)?. 

The big table at the center of the room is an irregular polygon, with one chair pushed up to the shortest side. I think the shape is intended to undermine traditional conceptions of academic hierarchy, but in practice it  just means that whoever gets to seminar late has to sit with a table angle jabbing him in the stomach.

/(We could|I'd like to|We want to|I'm inclined to|My response would be to) ask which conlangs she knows.

[Your score has gone up by three points and is now forty-eight.]

> put problem on shelves
We take a moment to find the proper place for the book.

The sound of discussion comes from down the hall: two voices speaking in Lojban, and then a male voice interrupting. "Do you have a license for this conversation?" it asks.

"Excuse me," Higgate says. "I'd better go see to that."

She waves and heads back northeast.

> go to brown's lab
/(We |We have a (brief|quick) |We make the( brief| quick)? |It's a( brief| quick)? )(walk|hike).

Brown's Lab
Professor Brown, the Reification of Abstracts researcher, is hunched over his work table. Brown is only barely a professor at all — actually, his working title is Senior Lecturer, and he holds a yearly contract which the University has the option to renew at whim. This prevents him going elsewhere while ensuring that he never has a fully-funded lab of his own. All the electrical equipment down here is tinker-toys compared to the stuff he really wants; in fact, half of it he built himself with components he bought with his own money.

I know all this because Brown cornered me in the hallway one afternoon and talked to me for twenty minutes straight about the pressures of academic job-hunting in the current political climate. I tried to get him to stop, but he's like a wind-up toy.

"Don't touch anything, please," he says, without looking up.

/(We could|I'd like to|We want to|I'm inclined to|My response would be to) ask what he is doing.

> ask what
"What are you up to there?" we ask. Asking Brown questions when he's working is a bit of a crap-shoot, I tell you now.

He wiggles his nose back and forth. I knew him for three months before I figured out what the wiggle is: it is his hands-free way of working his spectacles back up his nose when they start to slide down. 

Without looking at us, he says, "I'm getting ready to do a new calibration run on 'love'." 

This is a favorite of his, because you can get it so easily from a glove, so the materials are inexpensive.

/(We could|I'd like to|We want to|I'm inclined to|My response would be to) ask what love looks like or ask how Professor Brown makes abstracts.

> ask what
"What does love look like, then?" we ask, as though I hadn't seen this a bunch of times already.

"It varies," Professor Brown replies. "The manifestation of a complex concept depends on a variety of circumstances; by default if multiple concepts are available, the letter tool will produce whichever concept requires least energy to produce, but in cases where several concepts are indistinguishably popular, the results are apparently random.

"Recent research suggests that the outcome can be influenced by the language community surrounding the operation and even by the intention of the tool's user (to a limited degree); but I am not interested in pursuing those angles at present." 

There: Professor Brown in a nutshell. Did he tell you anything you wanted to know? No.

The deal is that manifestations of "love" tend to look like stuff you'd find on a greeting card: roses, hearts, kiss symbols. Every once in a while you get something a little more platonic. But it's a let-down, if you want to know the truth. Most significant abstracts are like that: all you get by reifying them is a popular visualization. 

/(We could|I'd like to|We want to|I'm inclined to|My response would be to) ask how Professor Brown makes abstracts.

> ask how
"What equipment do you use to make your abstracts?" we ask.

"It's an ordinary letter-remover with a few adjustments," Brown says. "The department's computer can lift some of the legal overrides on standard letter tools. The job would be easier if I had access to higher-powered machinery, but..."

/(We could|I'd like to|We want to|I'm inclined to|My response would be to) ask whether he can fix the letter-remover.

> ask whether
"Could you fix my letter-remover to make abstract objects as well?"

"It's not difficult, you just— oh, stay here, I'm not supposed to bring students into the rectification room."

He takes the letter-remover and steps out into the hallway. I can hear him using his keycard on the door, going into the little room west of the hallway, doing something there. (Don't bother thinking we're going to cosh him and take the keycard. I'm sure there's a better way, and I don't cosh people.)

He comes back in a minute.

"There," he says. "Should be abstract-enabled now."

/(We could|I'd like to|We want to|I'm inclined to|My response would be to) ask what he thinks of the letter-remover or thank Professor Brown.

[Your score has gone up by three points and is now fifty-three.]

> ask what
"Is there anything else that could be done to upgrade my letter-remover?" we ask naively.

"Nothing I can help you with, I'm afraid," he says. "There are some safety overrides that could be programmed out, allowing you to make living creatures, but that's..." He does his spasmodic shrug. "One of those things where I think the laws have a point. It's dangerous and possibly even cruel."

/(We could|I'd like to|We want to|I'm inclined to|My response would be to) ask why reifying living creatures is cruel or thank Professor Brown.

> ask why
"Why would it be cruel to make a living creature?" you ask.

"We don't know whether such creations have awareness and sensation like other creatures," he says. "If they do, it is horrible to bring them into existence only to send them out again."

Graduate Student Office
A small windowless room divided into cubicles for individual graduate students.

A tiny refrigerator stores lunches (sometimes) and looted leftovers from department receptions (when available). The door is currently open, revealing a silver platter (littered with the remains of a party, including a crumpled cocktail napkin and a shrimp tail). On top of the fridge there is a coffee-maker.

My cubicle is the one with the swivel-chair, towards the back of the room by the water cooler.

Long Street is lined on each side with a double-row of tall, anemic palm trees that bend towards one another many feet overhead. We are now in the southern part of this long corridor, between the Canadian Embassy and Arbot Maps & Antiques.

Fleur d'Or Lobby
The Fleur d'Or is a high-end hotel that serves businessmen and luxury tourists interested in the linguistic mechanisms of the island. As a result, it has all kinds of paid exemptions, including an exemption allowing it to operate under a foreign name.

The spotlights in the ceiling light the floor in distinct pools of Bureau blue, and a sheet of frosted glass etched with random letters separates the lobby from the drinks club to the west.

There is no one at the glossy piano in the corner, though a piece has been left on the piano bench.

Fleur d'Or Drinks Club
The back wall is dramatically decorated with bottled liquors of all sorts, from gin to cachaça; there's a giant bottle of Campari, taller than your average three-year-old, with a red ribbon around its neck.

What makes this place technically a drinks club rather than a bar is its license to serve letter-manufactured food and drink. A toolkit on the bar contains some gimlets and some rusty nails, ready to be transformed into their respective cocktails.

The bartender and Mark are still talking about the homonym paddle. The other patrons are scattered around the room at small tables, drinking or talking among themselves. 

"Hello," the bartender says.

"That was a little dangerous, wasn't it?" Mark asks. "If you had tapped me with that thing, wouldn't I be a giant X on the carpet now?"

"Not for long," the bartender says. "I do have some restoration gel for emergencies. Or I could just hit you again with the paddle. But there would be an incident report and I could lose my license. So, yeah, better not."

At the moment it stands invitingly open.

Lecture Hall (at the podium)
The main lecture hall used for large survey courses in language studies offered to undergraduates. I sat through courses here when I was an undergraduate myself, and have now delivered a few lectures as a teaching assistant.

A poster at the front of the room announces a conference on cultural reactions to linguistic change. It is being held in Nice the day after tomorrow, with Professor Waterstone as keynote speaker, on the topic of "homonym shame". Somehow I had forgotten about the date of this: I've been too much worried about our escape.

The room extends south, full of hard wooden seats. Abandoned on one near the back is a coat.

Lecture Hall (among the seats)
Many are the fine hours I have spent here dozing; and many are the students of mine who have done the same. The circle of life becomes complete.

The room extends north, full of hard wooden seats. Abandoned on one near the back is a coat. 

Someone has taped to the wall a course advertisement for next quarter, inviting interested undergraduates to enroll in Interlingua 101. Probably Professor Higgate's work.

/We (take|get|pick up|acquire) the coat. It's been abandoned here for a while, since this isn't the time of year when people wear coats. It's brown cloth, only thick enough to keep out rain or a mild chill, and it's rubbed shiny at the elbows. No wonder the owner didn't miss it much.

Language Studies Department Office
This big, slightly drab area holds such useful objects as the mailboxes and the secretary's computer. On ordinary days the secretary would be in as well, presiding over affairs. The offices of individual professors lie north and west, though both doors are closed.

The printer also sits on the u-shaped desk. 

There is a continuous angry whine from the jigsaw.

> knock on waterstone's door
Waterstone looks at the camembert, briefly arrested by some thought. He gets a monocle like mine out of his drawer. He looks through it at the camembert, notes the member and the cat; grins. He gets up and comes out of his office.

"This is perfect," Waterstone says. "One more example to put into my talk — but I really should be going — should be able to get a ride from my wife — if I leave now — Here, you can have this if it interests you. I won't have time to use it." He sets an invitation down on the desk.

"Come back and talk to me again later," he adds. "We can discuss your goals as a student. And now I really have to go — should have gone hours ago." (There, see: he can be a nice man. More or less.)

He locks his door again and goes out. I think he is actually humming something.

Before we can do anything, Waterstone pops his head back in. "What you did there — not strictly within the rules. But I admire, shall we say, Realpolitik. You'll go far. Ignore Brown, but you'd probably do that anyway. Never talk to Higgate at all. I will see you later."

And he pops back out.

University Oval
This is the center of the university, a broad grassy oval shaded with sycamore trees and surrounded by buildings in brick or white stone.

Immediately south of here is the building where I spend most of my time, Samuel Johnson Hall. 

We can also see a sin here. 

There are a couple of officers lounging by the university gate. We won't be able to go by without being seen.

As I'm taking this in, you notice hubbub behind us. We move out of the way as more officers escort Professor Higgate from the building.

There is a continuous angry whine from the jigsaw.

"There's been a mistake," Higgate is saying coolly. "That conversation was conducted under a special license for research in constructed languages. I can produce a copy —"

The officer leading her says, "We're acting on information." He gives a quick, revealing glance in the direction of Professor Brown, who is also coming out of the building.

There is a continuous angry whine from the jigsaw.

"Alex Rosehip," says the officer with Higgate. The back of my neck prickles. "What can you tell me about his constructed language?"

Higgate stops moving forward and the officers stop with her. "It really is a masterpiece — the root words are all based on resources common in the tropics. Dirt and mud are highly productive terms, as are many common pests. The syllables are consonant-dense but still relatively easy to pronounce. In my view, it's the most credible proposal ever put forward in utopian linguistics."

The officer smiles faintly. "Isn't that a bit like 'the world's most credible proposal for a perpetual motion engine'?"

Time crawls by.

There is a continuous angry whine from the jigsaw.

"Whether it works or not, I am sure it's not intended as an attack on the Anglophone efficacy," Higgate says. "Alex has a fine mind but very little gumption. And he loves Atlantis."

"As far as you're aware," the officer replies.

"Obviously," Higgate snaps. "I can only tell you what I know of Alex from five years of close supervision."

The officers look at one another, then back at her. "We're going to need to continue this conversation in depth."

A stricken expression crosses Higgate's face.

The officers sweep Higgate away into a windowless van. "Mobile Conversation Unit," says the side of the van in bright cheery letters. "The Bureau Is Listening to YOU!"

The van pulls away into traffic. Brown strolls away in the other direction, not meeting anyone's eye. It's not easy getting tenure around here.

Tall Street is full of families, some reaching as far as the old park at the east end of the street.

They're gathered around a hanging cardboard figure in front of the Bureau of Orthography. The children, and a few of the adults, are taking turns hitting it with sticks, hoping for a shower of comma-shaped candy. This is a common holiday activity, but from the disgruntled comments and the petulant expressions of the children, it has already been going on longer than is strictly fun.

Abandoned Park
In contrast with the parks in the more savory parts of town, this is a bit of patchy grass where local dogs occasionally come out to do their business. A granite war memorial is fixed at the center, which is why tourist maps optimistically call the place Monument Green. But the memorial is only moderately monumental and the grass hardly green at all.

We step on a bent twig before we back away again. 

It is a place that might have been developed long ago; only it is known that there are remains of Roman settlement here, and there is a risk that digging out the foundations would turn up some of those ruins, exposing a large number of Latin-language objects to the light of day. To prevent this catastrophe the whole area has been placed off limits to development.

We can go southeast and west to Tall Street from here.

Bus Station
A currently-desolate depot from which buses run seasonally to Maiana, the island's other major town. The old station building is a low, rectilinear edifice from the 60s, all pebbled concrete and sheet glass, but it's shut, leaving accessible only a series of empty bus bays and a wall-mounted schedule. The public convenience to the east is the only thing open, while the area to the northwest is open parkland.

Antechamber
The most important task of any government bureau is to keep away time-wasters, irritants, and uninformed members of the general public, who might distract the diligent workers within from their important tasks. The Bureau of Orthography is no different.

An instructive notice details the criteria for entry to the Bureau proper.

Here to guard access to the rest of the building is a secretary on a tall stool. The secretary is carrying the Regulation Authentication Scope and wearing a pencil skirt and a plain white top. 

We can go north to the Rotunda and east from here.

"That will do," the secretary says of our pass. Then she inspects the invitation with the monocle. "Most of the visits were earlier in the day," she says. "Quite a fracas there was this morning."

"The invitation doesn't state a particular time," we say.

She deflates momentarily and goes back to inspecting. "There's another problem. This invitation is for Professor Waterstone. They're watermarked individually to avoid fraud. You're not Professor Waterstone."

"He sent me to do some research in his place. I'm a student of his."

She frowns. "Invitations to inspect highly secure machinery are not transferrable," she says. "And how should I know whether you stole it?"

"Professor Waterstone is a busy man," I say. "If you want me to tell him you wouldn't cooperate, I'm just as happy not to work on Serial Comma Day. But if DCL wants his endorsement or advice, they'll have to work within his schedule. If you are going to turn me away, however, I would like the opportunity to speak with your manager."

The secretary scowls. "Fine. I'll contact Waterstone." She places a call — on speakerphone, no less — glaring all the time.

"Waterstone here," says the phone. There's background traffic noise. Waterstone must be on the road already. Figures he would have a car phone. Most people aren't allowed, here.

"I have a student here attempting to use your invitation to enter the Bureau," says the secretary. "Was it stolen?"

"What? Oh that. No."

"You're saying you gave your invitation away."

"Yes I did," says Waterstone. "And I have been a research partner to DCL since before you were born."

"Sir, you are aware that this is highly irregular!"

The secretary is still talking. "You personally vouch for this student? You know her well and are sure of her trustworthiness?"

"What a delightful man," remarks the secretary.

She looks over our other visible possessions (the pass, the sword, the ink, the sill, the backpack, the ale, and the arm) and deems them acceptable. She makes us sign a book, for which we use a signature of your invention. Finally: "Go in, descend to the basement, and present yourself at the secure section downstairs. Be advised you will be under video surveillance as you approach. Any attempts to modify or steal Bureau property, to gain access to rooms to which you have not been expressly invited, to eavesdrop on conversations of Bureau employees, or to leave objects of your own behind in the Bureau, may result in your arrest and prosecution.

Fully half the stations are empty, due to their owners being away on call somewhere on the island, but the rest are fully occupied — many of them by people who wear authentication monocles routinely.

Sensitive Equipment Testing Room
A room with no windows, no cameras, no recording equipment, and barely any furniture.

A rock sits in one corner of the room. 

At the center of the room is a gleaming new T-inserter Machine. This is a state of the art device: letter removal has been well understood for decades, but insertion is much more dangerous and difficult, fraught with ambiguity.

We open the backpack.

There is a continuous angry whine from the jigsaw.

We dip out a pea-sized quantity of gel and rub it gently onto the rock. With an audible SPLORT, the rock becomes Brock. He looks a bit haggard to me, but I don't think anything too horrible has happened to him. So perhaps you can stop worrying.

There is a continuous angry whine from the jigsaw.

Brock looks rather awkward, and clambers out of our ineffective hold onto solid ground.

Brock stands, dusting himself off. He looks us up and down without expression, without any sign of recognition. "What day is it?" he asks.

"Still Serial Comma Day," you say. "Brock, it's me. And Alex, but I'm here."

The waxen look melts and he grins. "Thank god. It's harder than you'd expect being a rock."

There is a loud and satisfying pop from the machine as it turns the apple into an applet.

An abstract representation. An anonymous browser window appears to hover in the air, currently showing satellite footage of the big demonstration a few hours ago.

There is a continuous angry whine from the jigsaw.

"Right. It's good on abstracts, then," Brock says, contemplating the applet.

Brock touches some gel to the jigsaw. "Just in case someone out there is listening." With an audible SPLORT, the jigsaw becomes a jigsaw.

I glare at him.

"I know there's no time," he says. "But there are supposed to be all sorts of things in the Bureau sub-basement that have never seen the light of day. DCL projects that went wrong, secret government experiments, possibly a buried command center."

> put ale in t-inserter
There is a loud and satisfying pop from the machine as it turns the ale into a tale.

Of course, there were other options there: the T-inserter could have made two words. But it seems to be disambiguating to the tale. The question now is whether it would do so consistently or whether its behavior is underdetermined; we don't have time for a really thorough trial set, but checking a couple more times may be indicative.

It begins with "once upon a time," and the letters scroll up delicately through the air when we start to read. It weaves a narrative as follows: 

/Once upon a time,*

Achievement accomplished: Propper Rosehip award for talespinning!

> put gel on tale
We dip out a pea-sized quantity of gel and rub it gently onto the tale. With an audible SPLORT, the tale becomes an apple. 

> wave p-remover at apple

/(He's looking at us, but when I look back, he cuts his eyes away. I look away again.)?

> put ale in t-inserter
We momentarily lift the ale out of the T-inserter machine and then drop it back in.

There are three small pops from the machine as it turns the ale into a tattle. There now: the T-inserter has constructed both tale and tattle. Not very stable, it seems. Slango will be interested to know that.

It is non-physical, but it sounds like a waspish playground voice recounting the sins of another child.

/(An excited child's voice says, "Freddy made an underage twine purchase."|"Daddy, Timmy turned my bread into a bead!" tattles a childish voice.|A child's voice from the tattle says, "Mom! Timmy took the R out of my rice!")

"The fact that it made the tale and the tattle means that the stabilization is inconsistent at best," Brock says. "And I don't see any min-max calibrator on the outside. Remind me to check the plans again when we get back to the yacht. They may not have tried to handle that problem at all."

Brock touches some gel to the tattle. "In the spirit of keeping the peace." With an audible SPLORT, the tattle becomes an apple.

> put pic in t-inserter
There is a loud and satisfying pop from the machine as it turns the pic into a Pict.

A long-boned man with a fair thatch of hair, dressed in coarse woolen clothing and wearing a silver chain around his neck. He doesn't look as though he speaks English, somehow.

"Check," says Brock. "And that's all we need here. Now..." He hesitates. "One person escaping is easier than two, I suppose."

You start to object, but I say, "Yes, you'd better return to petrified form." You know I'm right. He'll be easier to carry.

A little grimly, he produces his own letter-remover and repeats the B-removal that made him in the first place. We're alone with the Pict.

The Pict gets out of the T-inserter machine.

"Alex." 

I can't help it: I stop and turn. It's too ingrained in me. And it's my father's voice.

He's wearing his ordinary work clothes, but he looks strained to the point of fracture. And someone could come out of any of these doors at any moment.

"Your mother told me about meeting your supposed girlfriend at your apartment. She was puzzled by that, but I knew what must have happened," my father says, in a very low voice. "I deleted the record of your unauthorized synthesizer draining the power grid, which, by the way, could get me dismissed."

/(We could|I'd like to|We want to|I'm inclined to|My response would be to) deny everything.

> deny everything
"You must have me confused with someone else."

He sighs. Not deceived even a little; weary that we tried.

/(Somewhere down the hall a clock ticks loudly. |No one speaks for a moment. The silence is almost eerie. )?"I didn't tell your mother what I suspected, but when it comes out you've… defected… I won't be able to keep this from her. And you're giving up your career. Mine too, possibly; we'll all be under suspicion, I suppose.

"It's pointless. You could have done a great deal for the Bureau from within. I was trying to help you see that."

/(We could|I'd like to|We want to|I'm inclined to|My response would be to) lay out our reasons or be comforting.

"I want to do something that matters," I say. "I don't see my work making a speck of difference here."

"You mean you don't see my work as important," he says. "Got that from your mother, I imagine."

"So your partners in crime are, what, smugglers? Industrial saboteurs? That's wonderful. Finally some role models."

Time passes.

"Here's what we're going to do, Alex. You're going in there—" (he points at a door to the southwest) "—and I'm going to call for backup to arrest the first person that comes out. That could be Alex, it could be whoever-else-you-are, it could be both of you in this same body.

"If it is Alex who comes back out, I can't possibly save your university career, but we might be able to make a case for clemency." What he means by that— oh. Yes. I understand now.

He gives us a hard shove. We're half inside the room when we hear his last remark:

"Alex... don't try to escape back through the Rotunda. If you really can't come home, then head north. I've never seen it, but supposedly there's an emergency exit up there."

Then he's gone.

Cold Storage
Shelves on both sides of the room are full of objects on stands: objects that used to be men and women, and in a few cases even children. The stand labels preserve their original names.

A duty roster is posted prominently. 

If this goes wrong, we could wind up living in here permanently. So we'd better figure whom to send out, and do it fast.

> yes

We gel the nearest of the objects, and it comes to life: a woman in her thirties or forties, at first so motionless that she looks like a statue, until she remembers that she can move.

"Thank goodness," says the woman. "I felt like I was going to lose myself if I had to spend another minute in there. I don't know who you are, but thank you, thank you! Is there a Bureau reprieve? Please tell me they've decided to let us all out!"

"No general reprieve," you say. "Just you."

This isn't what I want. It's not just unfair; it's actually monstrous. "What were you put in for?" I ask.

"Italian," she whispers.

"What?"

"I was learning Italian," she says. "I wanted to read Manzoni. There was no sympathy from the officers; they thought it was an inexplicable desire. Is it daylight or night-time out there? Not that it matters. I haven't seen either in so long."

You gesture at the door. She looks at us once more, doubtfully, and goes.

From the corridor comes the sound of a shot being fired from a restoration gel rifle; the woman exclaiming in pain; officers gathering around her for the arrest. And she'll be back here, I suppose, before the night is out. I suppose that allows you to tell yourself that it wasn't a bad thing, what we just did.

A faint spell comes over you and you feel dizzy.

This is nothing less than the command center for a massive propaganda campaign. Paintings of Atlantida and polling charts cover the walls, dating back to the second world war and continuing straight through to the present.

/(On the long table|There) are a paperweight and an inciting fable( on the long table)?. 

You can go south to Wonderland and east from here.

> x fable
It's a short children's tale, with illustrations. A young boy was left an orphan in a certain village. So he went door to door around the village, but none of the families would take him in, all having some excuse: there were too many children already, the house was too small, there was not enough food, the parents were too old for a new child, and so on.

Despondent, the boy was on the verge of giving up when a magician came to town. He went around door to door with the boy a second time, this time asking each household for just one letter. When he was done, he used a powerful machine on the letters in his bag, and transformed them into a LOVING FAMILY!

(The text ends here, but the illustration shows the boy beaming in the arms of a manufactured mother, father, siblings, hamster, and goldfish.)

> gel fable
You dip out a pea-sized quantity of gel and rub it gently onto the inciting fable. With an audible SPLORT, the inciting fable becomes a filing cabinet. There are numerous files, and they are organized chronologically, so that it's possible to look up a specific year. They appear to begin in 1942.

> x charts
Blue lines on the charts record the citizen responses to the concept of Atlantida. They record wartime progress in establishing the concept in the popular imagination, with a spike in 1942, corresponding to a heavy press of propaganda.

After the war, there's a break in the charts until 1951, when tracking resumes. Additional spikes appear at 1968 and 1972.

Each chart also shows a yellow line, which roughly goes down as the blue line goes up. It is labeled "Power to generate animate abstract." The yellow line stops at 1982 and no further points are recorded on it.

> look up 1942 in cabinet
Checking through the filing cabinet for 1942 reveals some images of Atlantida. Here is her militant 1940s rendition, where she stands bestride Atlantis; Axis planes are flying past her at head level. At any moment she might bite one and shake it, like a bulldog.

> put counterweight on hook
You hang the counterweight on the hook. The portcullis shifts slightly but doesn't rise on its own. Perhaps with a little help, though.

/(The air stirs with a breeze from the east.)?

> open portcullis
You open the portcullis.

Personal Apartment
At a guess, this is a room hardly anyone ever visits, or even knows about. Though the ceiling and one wall are bare cave, the rest has been paneled and  graciously decorated in the style of the end of the 18th century. Oil paintings on the walls depict great men and women of Atlantis gone by: Phyllida Shaply, Amelia Landison, Clarence Arbot, Jon Rosehip. An antique bed stands in the center of the room.

The metal portcullis guards the way back. It is currently raised. From the pulley above the portcullis hangs a counterweight. 

/(There|On the inlaid desk) are a stack of files and a rubber stamp( on the inlaid desk)?. 

Air and sunlight stream in from the east.

"Don't move, Alexandra, or I'll split you in two."

A very tall woman with Bureau-blue eyes steps into the room from the east, carrying a restoration gel rifle. Her face is ageless, her mouth full-lipped but proud. We've never met, but you recognize her at once.

Atlantida moves the rifle a fraction and fires through the portcullis at the counterweight. With an audible SPLORT, the counterweight becomes a weight and a counter. 

The weight falls to the ground.

The portcullis crashes shut.

> x stamp
It is made to stamp two words: ETHICAL VETO. The discoloration shows it has indeed been used, though not, perhaps, very recently.

> z
Time passes.

She fires again. The pellet hits us, cold and hard, in the shoulder. It stings like hell and for a moment I think our clavicle is broken. You put our hand over the wounded spot.

Our hand.

Atlantida lowers the rifle, surprised. "Fused," she says. "Isn't that interesting. And so recently, too. If the gel rifle won't separate you, nothing will." She smiles, not warmly. "Pity. You would have been easier to deal with separately. Cold Storage for Andra, house arrest for Alex."

Fused? We should be two pieces by now. Maybe she has an explanation? But you seem to be focused on her gun hand. How can you be so calm?

> shoot atlantida with anagramming gun
The gun fires ruggedly into Atlantida, but is unable to make anything interesting out of a, a, a, d, i, l, n, t, and t. Atlantida recoalesces into her original form.

Atlantida smiles with half a mouth. "You've arrived on a difficult day. In the ordinary course of things, I keep things quiet: the spirit of democracy, but none of the sordid wrangling and bribes and corruption and compromise. It's only when the spirit of the island itself is threatened, that we have to resort to such extreme measures."

/(You could|I'd like to|You want to|I'm inclined to|My response would be to) ask whether the protesters feel the same way.

> shoot rifle with anagramming gun
The gun fires ruggedly into the restoration gel rifle, which shatters and then reforms as the infertile astrologer. She's a woman with long grey hair, well past menopause.

The infertile astrologer falls awkwardly to earth and looks around in confusion.

"Oh, bravo," says Atlantida. "Could you possibly have made a less useful ally?"

> gel atlantida
You dab a bit on our finger and approach, but she is far too large, far too spry. She catches our wrist and forces us aside, until the gel is harmlessly absorbed into our own skin.



"Oh, no, my dear," Atlantida says. "They could remake me, but it wouldn't be the same me, would it? It would be some new construct. The Atlantida of today. And that's not the way to a consistent policy, is it?"

> gel astrologer
You dip out a pea-sized quantity of gel and rub it gently onto the infertile astrologer. With an audible SPLORT, the infertile astrologer becomes a restoration gel rifle. 

Atlantida realizes that the restoration gel rifle is now a couple of meters away from her. 

She presses a button on something in her hand. Far away, a high-pitched bell rings.

"Did you have anything else you wanted to ask me? I so rarely get to talk with ordinary citizens. Only ones with clearance, and those about to go into Cold Storage. A last interview with Saint Peter."

> shoot atlantida with rifle
We sidle over and casually pick up the restoration gel rifle as though we were just curious. Or maybe had an insatiable urge to tidy up.

Her eyes follow the gesture. "Don't you dare, you little traitor," she says. "I have been your mother, your father, your waking up and your going to sleep, your teachers and your lovers and your friends. I am the integrity of this island. Change me and you change Atlantis forever."

"Maybe it's time," I say. "Maybe part of the business of democracy is having the arguments—"

You don't let me finish. You shoot the restoration gel rifle at Atlantida. With an audible SPLORT, Atlantida becomes an atlantida. It's a sort of shellfish, vaguely like a clam or scallop but bigger and with different ridges.

> get atlantida
/You (take|get|pick up|acquire) the atlantida. It's heavy as a rock, because it has been fossilized.

There's a distant sound of movement. Someone is looking for us.

> e

Private Solarium
A window in the north wall, cut out through the cliff face, gives a view of tranquil sea under a darkening sky. 

/Left on a coffee table \(as though waiting for maid service\) is a silver tray. (On the silver tray|There) are some jacks, a cloth napkin, some crumbs, and a dirty coffee cup( on the silver tray)?. 

/(On the chaise longue is an ebook reader|There is an ebook reader on the chaise longue). 

> n
You could do that. You could climb out that window and not look back. It would be faster, easier, unquestionably safer. But what about the people we're leaving behind? What about my father and Professor Higgate? What about the protesters who got arrested today?

We'll only know they're safe if we leave this island with a new, improved Atlantida. Someone the Bureau will have to listen to. The one they were afraid of creating. One who will put power back in the hands of the citizen referendum.

So you tell me how it's going to be. Are you going to stay and see to things? >>
> yes

That's what I thought.

> x jacks
A set of children's playing jacks. They are lined up, with curious precision, into the letter A.

> take jacks
/You (take|get|pick up|acquire) the jacks.

> wave s-remover at jacks
/You reset the device to s. There is a [a-z \-]+, and the jacks turn into a jack. A heavy-duty jack, suitable for raising cars or other substantial objects.

> go to workshop
/(You |You have a (brief|quick|short) |You make the( brief| quick| short)? |It's a( brief| quick| short)? )(walk|hike) (over to|as far as|to) Personal Apartment. There you try propping the portcullis with the jack.

/(Then|Next|After that|From there) (you |you have a (brief|quick|short) |you make the( brief| quick| short)? |it's a( brief| quick| short)? )(walk|hike).

Workshop
A room whose importance is obvious from how clean it is and how little furniture it is allowed to have.

A programmable dais sits in the middle of the room. It has the raw look of lab equipment rather than a nice smooth commercial instrument. 

A power cord snakes across the ground, connecting the dais socket to the wall socket. 

You can go east to the Generator Room and west to the Surveillance Room from here.

You definitely hear footsteps. And voices.

> put atlantida on platform
You put the atlantida on the programmable dais.

> set platform to homonym
You give the switch a strong twist and turn it to swap homonym.

> turn on platform
The programmable dais glows deep red. Almost at once Atlantida is lying on the surface. She looks very similar to her earlier self, but the differences are there. The eyes are grey now. A tattoo of a writhing squid encircles her left wrist. Her face is younger.

She gets to her feet.

"You'd better leave, quickly," she says. "I'll make sure your friends get out, but it will be easier if we don't have to explain you as well."

/(You could|I'd like to|You want to|I'm inclined to|My response would be to) ask how to fix the fusion.

> go to personal apartment
/(You |You have a (brief|quick|short) |You make the( brief| quick| short)? |It's a( brief| quick| short)? )(walk|hike).

Personal Apartment
At a guess, this is a room hardly anyone ever visits, or even knows about. Though the ceiling and one wall are bare cave, the rest has been paneled and  graciously decorated in the style of the end of the 18th century. Oil paintings on the walls depict great men and women of Atlantis gone by: Phyllida Shaply, Amelia Landison, Clarence Arbot, Jon Rosehip. An antique bed stands in the center of the room.

Atlantida stands nearby, urging us to hurry out via the Private Solarium. I think she's enjoying her role as conspiratorial heroine. 

The metal portcullis guards the way back. It is currently raised a few feet by a jack. From the pulley above the portcullis hangs a counter. 

/(There|On the inlaid desk) are a stack of files and a rubber stamp( on the inlaid desk)?. 

Air and sunlight stream in from the east.

Someone is coming into the workshop upstairs. There's at most a few seconds before they'll be down the tunnel.

> take jack
/You (take|get|pick up|acquire) the jack.

The portcullis crashes shut.

The portcullis should at least slow down anyone coming after us. Though that's only moderately comforting.

> e
She follows. "Go, go," she says. "You've done good work today. Atlantis is grateful."

Private Solarium
Atlantida stands nearby, urging us to hurry out via the Private Solarium.

/(There|On the chaise longue) is an ebook reader( on the chaise longue)?. 

From the other room, the noises make it sound as though someone is using a metal torch to dismantle the portcullis bar by bar.

> n
You open the tall window.

As soon as we're through, Atlantida closes the window behind us, and we hear it lock. No evidence that we came through here, now.

Precarious Perch
From up here there's a handsome view of the sea, which isn't so far down really. But it's a scramble down a nearly sheer cliff for the first bit, until you make it down to the rockfall below, and it would be easy for a careless person to injure herself.

It's hard to see through the tall window to the room behind: mostly it reflects the sea.

> wave k-remover at rock
You reset the device to k. With a distinct whiff of sweaty animal, the rock turns into a roc. The bird is enormous. Brock is a tall man, but not nearly this tall. Its eyes are bright and (if you are not reading too much in) ironically clever; its plumage a little like an eagle's, if an eagle were made many times larger and feathered in a kind of sleek, luminous black.

The roc is too awkward for you to carry, and half-falls, half-jumps to the ground.

> ride roc
You mount the roc.

It stares at us for a moment, and you climb carefully onto its back, putting our arms around its neck. A dozen drawbacks occur at the last minute. What if there isn't enough room for the takeoff? What if it needs to run — like a plane — before it can get airborne?

The roc strains its neck forward, spreads its wings and steps off the cliff. Its flaps are slow and you are losing altitude — so fast that at first I think you'll fall into the ocean — but it takes only five or six flaps before the bird is able to glide straight out to sea.

> n
I think you pretty much have to go where the roc wants to go.

I keep thinking you are going to lose our grip, but somehow you manage to stay on. Sooner than I expect, you make out the shine of Slango's yacht, and in the next moment you are above it. The roc circles once or twice before coming to land on the Sunning Deck.

Sunning Deck (aboard the True Macaque)
This is a very fine boat: sleek, shiny, big... Oh, you don't like it when I put it that way, I see. All right then: a high-speed yacht, something luxurious enough that it looks like a rich man's toy to harbor officials, but it handles almost like a cigarette boat. Fiberglass hull, shaped in a deep V for racing, capable of 80 knots on a calm sea. Range of around 300 nautical miles, enough to take us past Gibraltar to Málaga or perhaps even Almeria.

This bit is the aft portion, broad and flat and suitable for sunning oneself.

Slango has come out, though he's standing well back from the roc, which is surveying the scene speculatively.

Fixed on the roof above the entry to the navigation area is a white object that looks a little like an igloo. It is the communication unit that handles the yacht's wifi connection. 

Slango gels the roc easily enough. Then he and Brock turn the restoration gel on us. Slango is determined to separate you from me before he has a real talk with either of us; and it's not until a number of swipes in that he realizes how wrong things are.

"This isn't working," he remarks, tossing the gel and washcloth aside.

"We're fused," you explain, not very coherently. "Something happened. I don't know if it can be fixed."
Brock looks at us for a long moment and then turns away. He vanishes into the galley.

"I'm sure he's just gone to get you a cup of tea," Slango says. He takes a deep breath, stands. "The T-inserter specs better be worth what Brock says they are."

In the rocking boat, with the sound of the motor beneath us, you dream

of a ceremony on a clifftop with our two families seated looking on, and us in a long white dress, carrying a bouquet of scrabble tiles, walking down an aisle alone to be formally unified with ourself

of wearing a suit and meeting with some very rich men to talk about how to bring my language to Africa, and Brock giving us advice about how to handle them

of gathering all the indigenous languages, all the little dying languages, all the languages shoved aside because they lack linguistic efficacy, into a firefly bottle, where their letterforms flicker desperately

Galley (aboard the True Macaque)
Smaller than the kitchen in a comfortable house, but carefully and elegantly fitted, with an electric stovetop, a convection oven/microwave, a tiny refrigerator, a sink: enough, in short, to serve the crew of three on long trips. I guess even a fairly big boat is still small on the inside, eh?

There's even a little washing machine, for items too big to hand-wash in the sink.

It's the Chard-Farmer's Daily from Atlantis. A huge headline is splashed across the front:

"REFERENDUM ANNOUNCED!"

The picture on the front shows the Atlantida statue decked out with lights like a Christmas tree and people posing next to her for pictures.

My father has been promoted, apparently, to something called the Provisional Committee for Orthographic Reform. He is quoted as saying that the amnesty for Cold Storage prisoners is an important step forward. "Of course, government by citizen referendum brings its own problems, and further constitutional work may be needed if we mean to bring Atlantis in line with the European Union."

Brock comes down and hands us a coffee. "You look like you could use this. We've hit Mallorca," he says. "Slango's in town resupplying. I guess you saw the paper?"

You nod.

"One for the history books," he says, with a crooked smile. "They're showing satellite clips. Big olive garland on the depluralizing tank. People dancing on cars. Some old guy belting out La Marseillaise in the Bureau Rotunda."

Brock sits down opposite us. "In other news," he remarks, "it looks like your cut of the T-remover plans, with all the tests we ran, is going to come out to this." He writes a number. The number has six zeroes.

He leans back and looks at us.

"So. Where do we go from here?"
