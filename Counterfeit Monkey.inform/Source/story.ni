"Counterfeit Monkey" by Emily Short.


["The alphabet is a system of interchangeable parts. The word form can be surgically revised, instead of rewritten, to become the word farm or firm or fork or fort or from, or with a little more trouble, to become the word pineapple." -- Robert Bringhurst, The Elements of Typographic Style]

The release number is 6.

[Change log:
	
Release 6:

	Fixes a bug where resurrecting the player (i.e. answering yes to "Shall we suppose [you] didn't?" after dying) would sometimes break the game. Now we perform an undo rather than resume the story.
	Updates the version of Ultra Undo.

Release 5:
	
	*** Gameplay changes:
	Revises the way Waterstone responds to things he's shown, so that it is more clear that he is behind a glass door, and so that he is more obviously reacting to an item of the player's deliberate selection.
	Removes old requirements about use of disguises in the presence of others. This was just confusing, really.
	Removes requirement to be empty-handed before rowing, because this is just holding things up at what is otherwise nearly the end of the game, and because some of the messaging about it was actively confusing to some players. But it wasn't a puzzle really anyway.
	Removes an incorrect exit listing from the Equipment Archive.
	Fixes bug whereby APPROACH CAMERA could be misconstrued even though this was clearly hinted as an action during the basement sequence.
	Allows the player to type RESTORE during the name-recognition sequence at the beginning rather than playing through it.
	Adds a reverse mode to the vowel rotator bucket, allowing vowels to be rotated in the other direction. This removes the risk that the player will make TUB > TAB and accidentally destroy the only access to restoring gel (since this can be reversed). It also allows the player an alternate way to make a CORD for the power cord puzzle, via CARD > CURD > CORD. This is meant to address complaints about the umlaut punch being necessary, but of course it doesn't work in hard mode, which will still require the more difficult solution.
	Fixes a bug whereby the reconstructed Atlantida is less proactive than she was intended to be.
	Adds an afterlife feature to automatically undo accidental deaths.	

	*** Word repository:
	Adds CURD, CORD, CUD, COD, HURT, CUT, RILL, TRILL, PISA, PUN, PUNS, PUNT, PUNTS, PUS, TEN, TUN, TAN (extras), NET (extras), STENT, TENT, TENTS, BUSES, BUS, FOAL, LOAF, OAF, CLICK, BULL, DIG, and DIVA to support reversal mode on the bucket.
	Adds AHI, HOD, OZ, OHIO, and ZOO to support hard reversal mode on the bucket.
	Adds SHUTTLE homonym.
	Adds STOCK, SOCK, CHERT, CLUCK, CLACK, CACK, and POI products for the vowel-rotating bucket.
	Adds TORTE, TORT, and ORE (and an additional TOTE) as results of anagramming the OTTER.
	Adds TNT as a product of TINT.
	Adds SCREE as a product of SCREEN.
	Adds RAPE, PIECE, and COUNTER homonyms.
	Adds MARY anagram for ARMY.
	Adds PILLS anagram for SPILL, and ILLS and TILLS as derivatives thereof.
	Adds a singular CRUMB.
	Adds a BIG REVEL (anagram of BIG LEVER).
	Adds a WARP (anagram of WRAP), and its derivatives WAR and WART (though as WAR is fatal it is probably not possible to get WART).
	Adds a TRAVELLER TIP and a TRIPLE VARLET (from the TRAVELLER TIPS which can be anagrammed from SILVER PLATTER).
	Adds AGA and an additional AA object to be made from SAGAS (added in rev 4).
	Adds noisy homonyms for SNAP and RING, providing additional solutions to the masking noise puzzle.
	Adds TIDY PUCE COFFER anagram for the dirty coffee cup.
	Adds a singular OIL PAINTING for the OIL PAINTINGS in Atlantida's chambers. Also a singular INTAGLIO PIN and the resulting INTAGLIO PINT and TILTING PIANO.
	Adds a singular PAINTING for the PAINTINGS in the bureau.
	Adds INAPT SIGN as an anagram for the PAINTINGS, resulting also in INAPT SIN, SATIN PIN, SATIN PINT, SAINT PINT, GIANT PIN, GIANT PINT, PIG TAT INN, PI TAT INN, TITAN PIN, TITAN PINT, and INAPT TINT.
	Adds special responses to trying to S-remove the UMBRELLAS, the TEENAGERS, the BRINY RIVULETS, the RAILINGS, the SMALL CHILDREN, the YELLOW BUILDINGS or BEIGE BUILDINGS, or the PORTHOLES.
	Adds a MALL FIGURINE from the SMALL FIGURINES in Higgate's office.
	Adds a POLLING CHART as a singular of POLLING CHARTS, together with a STROLLING CHAP and a PATCHING ROLL.
	Adds a WINNER LOGO CHOCOLATE to be the singular of the same object, and a HOOTING OWL CONCEALER as its anagram.
	Adds BROKEN COMPONENT and CEMENT PORNO KNOB as products of the BROKEN COMPONENTS.
	Adds singulars LAMB GRANULATE and ANAGRAM BULLET for those objects.
	Adds FROZEN DINNER, ZEN FROND RINSE, and RED FROZEN INN as products of FROZEN DINNERS.
	Adds WARM ROD and RAD WORM products of SWORD ARM. (It was previously possible to get as far as WARM RODS, but not to remove the S.)
	Adds WIRE RACK and PAPER MODEL singulars.
	Adds TAT as a derivative of STATS.
	Adds BOCK as a derivative of BROCK.
	Takes the coward's way out and changes the FIGURES on the fountain to SCULPTED FIGURES so that they can't plausibly be depluralized in a way that would require varying the fountain description to account for both the state of the figures *and* the state of the horses. The whole HOSE transformation is enough, thanks.
	
	*** Parsing:
	Adds USE GUN ON X syntax for shooting.
	Fixes bug whereby in certain circumstances FIRE GUN AT X would not be recognized as synonymous with SHOOT.
	Fixes bug whereby the PLATE could not be referred to by name.
	Improves parsing so PUT BOOK AWAY and SHELVE BOOK would be understood as well as RETURN BOOK or PUT BOOK ON SHELVES.
	Adds synonym BACKSACK for BACKPACK.
	Adds synonym EDIFICE for the station building.
	Adds BOTTLE and GIANT BOTTLE and BOTTLE OF synonyms for the liquor collection.
	Adds IF as a synonym for WHETHER in many dialogue options.
	Adds PUNCH X WITH PUNCH or just PUNCH X in the presence of the umlaut punch.
	Adds PASTE X as a way of applying the origin paste.
	Makes it easier to refer to the newspaper at the very end as PAPER, and removes a conflict with the clipping (formerly NEWSPAPER CLIPPING)
	Adds more robust handling of input like SELECT OPTION 3 or SELECT CHOICE 3 or SELECT NUMBER 3 as an alternative for SELECT 3 (and other similar formations) when manipulating a computer with a multiple-choice interface.
	Improves parsing of some conversation options referring to characters by name or pronoun.
	Fixes bug whereby UNSCREW SCREWS WITH AS gave misleading feedback.
		
	*** Clarified descriptions and instructions:
	Corrects a piece of misleading output about cars, which suggested it was possible to park one that had not been started.
	Improves response to trying to gel yourself after you've learned that you are fused.
	Slightly rephrases the description of the spinner puzzle in order to make it easier to visualize.
	Rephrases feedback if you try to prop the trapdoor with something inappropriate, to be more specific about why the object is not sufficient.
	Fixes an instruction that incorrectly directed the player to the university rather than the dead-drop.
	Fixes a bug that gave a misleading message in response to an instruction to stand on the tarpaulin masses.
	Revises the phrasing used to describe exactly why a given prop won't work in the trap door.
	Fixes a bug whereby it is not immediately explained that the pinata is what is blocking you if you use GO TO ROTUNDA while the game is being played.
	Fixes a bug whereby Brock may appear confused by an abstract created not in the t-inserter, and act as though that counted as solving the puzzle.
	
	*** Improved world model:
	Improves character dialogue responses when the player asks about the current location.
	Fixes a loophole that allowed the player to get the attention of the men playing darts even though other code had been written to disallow them from having a conversation. Subsequent behavior was visibly buggy.
	Fixes a bug that misreported the window in the Private Solarium as closed even when it had been opened.
	Fixes a bug whereby the poster is described as still being attached to the Monumental Staircase wall even after it has been converted to a POSER and led to a new location, then gelled.
	Fixes a bug whereby it was possible to close the plexiglas even after cutting it open.
	Adjusts the weight of the puppy to make it easier to pick up.
	Fixes a bug whereby it was possible to put the ruck in the bucket and get a rack that could neither be taken nor gelled.
	Fixes bug whereby the boiler could be taken.
	Fixes bug whereby the coffee cup was described as empty even if the player put something in it.
	Fixes bug whereby it was possible to change an object that was propping a door without the door closing in response. 
	Fixes bug whereby mother could stare at an object that was inside our closed backpack.
	Fixes bug by which the department printer could whir even if switched off after the player leaves Waterstone's office.
	Fixes bug such that if you put the gel on the rock when it’s in the T-insertion machine, Brock won’t leave the machine, preventing the player from being able to put anything else into it (unless they turn him into a rock and remove him). 
	Fixes bug whereby flipping a yam twice with the pedestal turned it back to a yam, but the monocle thought it was still in an altered state. 
	Fixes bug whereby Brown could be described as hunched over his work table even when he was out in the Oval.
	Fixes bug such that animals in the kayak would spontaneously leap out (to their presumed watery deaths though this was not narrated).
	Fixes bug to do with reaching objects on the stand in the museum window. This in fact turned out to be the fault of an obscure error in the Inform world model (see http://inform7.com/mantis/view.php?id=1168) but has been hacked around.
	Revises the crypto-lock bucket so that large objects cannot be put into it and large objects constructed inside it will fall out.
	Accepts SE as a synonym to E when leaving Monumental Staircase for High Street, since one player felt the map looked more southeasterly than east at that point.
	Adds a clearer response for why taking the SAND is not a good option.
	Adds better responses for attempts to wash the funnel in the fountain or near a sink.
	Adds better responses to trying to pour and fill things (though it generally rejects these attempts, it at least recognizes what the player is attempting).
	Adds an exception to an overzealous rule that prevented the player from gelling air-like objects (such as a STINK manufactured in the T-inserter).
	
	*** Additional content:
	Addresses the disgraceful fact that Typoland Fun Fair could not be found in the guidebook.
	Adds "lodgings", public convenience and bus station to the guidebook as well.
	Adds chap-hop variant to the rap if you're wearing the Britishizing goggles.
	Adds responses to PLAY DARTS and PLAY ARKHAM HORROR (or other games aboard the yacht). (You're not actually allowed to do either, but at least we can respond better.) 
	Adds response to trying to synthesize ROCK and ROLL.
	Adds responses for E-removing Brown's goatee with and without an animate-enabled letter remover.
	Adds a couple of additional features to Brock's laptop, in case you hack in.
	Adds a special response for looking at your reflection through the monocle.
	
	*** Typos and cosmetic output errors:
	Corrects a typo in text about the winding footpath.
	Corrects a typo in description of fishing reel.
	Corrects a typo in the synonyms for the shrine object. 
	Hacks around a mysterious bug in which the apartment key was reported as "an key" rather than "a key". I am not sure why this was happening to start with.
	Fixes a rare runtime error to do with table rows used to record player goals.
	Fixes a bug such that the player was described as sitting IN the piano rather than on the piano bench in the Fleur d'Or lobby.
	Fixes a bug such that the description of the TROPE COUNT object was not set correctly.
	Fixes a bug whereby looking at Alex's apartment key with the monocle on did not produce any monocle reading.
	Fixes a bug whereby the footpath was referred to without the article if you looked at it through the monocle.
	Fixes a bug that made it possible to cut the kudzu with edgeless objects but get no description when one had done so.
	Fixes bug which misleadingly described the toolkit in the drinks club as empty if you looked at it directly.
	Fixes response to TOPICS command to avoid mentioning quips that are intended to go unmentioned.
	Fixes bug such that the first attempt to TAKE CHARD produced output only suitable for the chard garden, even if you'd manipulated it linguistically first and moved it somewhere else.
	Fixes bug whereby TOES was treated as singular.
	Fixes bug whereby ELECTRICAL EQUIPMENT, GRIT and TERRACING were treated as plural rather than mass nouns.
	Fixes bug whereby certain joke responses to synthesis occurred only for the synthesizer and not for the workshop dais. 
	Fixes bug whereby the kitchen sink would be described as still present after you'd converted it.
	Fixes bug whereby objects described as having text would nonetheless appear "blank" in response to READ (rather than examine).
	Fixes bug whereby a joke about eels and congress was supposed to be attached to the accent flipper but by mistake got attached to the equipment shelves, making it incomprehensible. Maybe it would have been anyway, but now it's at least in the right place.
	Fixes bug whereby answering Alex's initial questions with ANDRA as early as possible avoided the banner being printed. This failure ever to display the Inform affiliation is technically a violation of Inform's license.
	Fixes a bug whereby the command PUT POT ON PEDESTAL, referring to the yogurt, could hang the parser for ornate and complicated reasons. Rather than really fix this, we just made the YOGURT be YOGURT, not POT OF YOGURT. Because it wasn't worth it. As penance, added a TOY RUG object for the anagramming gun.
	
Release 4:
	Adds CORK (ROCK anagrammed), SAGAS (SAG + AS).
	Documents HARD MODE officially.
	Adds a description to the patchy grass in the monument green.
	Corrects a line about going to the university immediately after freeing the teens.
	Clarifies the dead drop goal so that a player who has left the game for a little while can review where they were supposed to be going.
	Fixes a bug whereby it was possible to hang the game by referring to "paper" in the presence of the draft document.
	Fixes a bug whereby typing TAKE ALL while carrying the pill will result in eating the pill (fatally).
	Fixes a bug where looking through the monocle at the tub didn't mention the tube.
	Improves responses to attempting to use the tube on the lock.
	Fixes a bug whereby DIGGING in the sand in the beach still produced a description of finding the funnel, even in hard mode where the funnel is not actually available.
	Fixes a bug whereby in one circumstance the paper drawer would be described as a paper-drawer, but would not accept the hyphenated form as input.
	Adds an extra Amy and an extra May to the repository so that they can be simultaneously produced by the army and by the yam, if need be.
	Fixes an error whereby the player was able to observe the wrong member of the Brock/Dad pair when looking in the surveillance screen.
	Adds synonyms for attempting to climb on the tarpaulin masses in the Tin Hut.
	Adds snarky response to trying to make font t-shits, pink t-shits, or various t-shits. (Mournful sigh.)
	Adds snarky response to trying to remove I from oneself.
	
Release 3: 
	Improves appearance of achievement announcements (line breaks, text styling).
	Sets the ticket-taker pronoun when you first see him, so GIVE TICKET TO HIM doesn't fail.
	Fixes bad line breaking when listening in the presence of the protesters.
	Fixes a typo in the description of turning the cannon.
	Fixes a bug whereby the cannon was takeable.
	Fixes buggy text output when putting the fuel in the car.
	Fixes a bug whereby turning on a car that wasn't properly fueled or oiled gave the wrong indications about its state of readiness.
	Fixes a buggy response to drinking the ale when the bar game had previously been about producing a pea-sized object.
	Fixes a bug whereby it's possible to kiss brock during any conversation, even if he's not in the room, if using the correct command format; and to see this possibility by typing TOPICS. 
	Fixes a bug whereby the plexiglas case was portable.
	Fixes a bug whereby anagramming the accent-flipper and then turning it back was sufficient to crush the player under the bulk of the recreated object.
	Fixes a bug whereby only two pi objects could be generated though in theory there should have been more.
	Adds the words bandage, basin, bait, tea, rite, gin, eight, wight, Ross, tart homonym, pot homonym, ant, tan, ten, net, ent, and rattle.
	Fixes a sequence bug whereby giving the mechanic the oil when the car wasn't around would lead to the mechanic notionally fixing something that wasn't there, while consuming the oil permanently. Adds some dialogue for the mechanic, allowing him to hint a little more clearly about the card state as necessary.
	Fixes a bug whereby the jigsaw was supposed to be noisy when turned on, but due to a typo in the rules, wasn't counting. This made hard mode significantly more hard.
	Fixes a bug whereby the modified names of objects in hard mode were not being respected.
	Fixes a bug whereby M-removing Mark after he'd been identified wasn't working properly because the game still thought of his name as "patron".
	Fixes a bug whereby having the broken components in inventory messes with parsing of the big lever on the work dais.
	Revises utilitarian inventory listing to be clearer about what is being worn or carried in the backpack, and whether the backpack is open or closed.
	Makes X ME give information about what you're wearing.
	Improves the response to trying to go north in Crumbling Wall Face.

Release 2:

	Fixes letter-tranformation behavior so that the newly constructed object will have its pronouns set properly (so "IT" will apply to the thing just made).
	Hackily fixes weird bug where, despite the code being evidently correct, "HIGHLIGHT" would activate score notification rather than the highlighting effect.
	Fixes bad instruction in ABOUT text that misdescribed the LOOK CAREFULLY function, and makes LOOK CLOSELY also work, for good measure.
	Fixes bug whereby an answer in the first three questions which included punctuation meant that the answer would not be correctly recognized. 
	Fixes a response to cutting things with the sword that says the sword is not edged.
	Fixes a bug whereby carrying the dove into the Cold Storage room resulted in the player immediately and involuntarily sending the patsy prisoner out to face the rifles.
	Fixes a bug whereby gelling Brock in Cold Storage wasn't working.
	Adds a response to attempting to cut the Atlantida pinata.
	Adds to the repository a countertop, a trope count, a hairband, a pineapple ring and a ripening apple.

Chapter 1 - Bibliographical Data

Include (- Switches z; -) before "Other Configuration" in "Output.i6t".

The story headline is "A Removal".

The story description is "Anglophone Atlantis has been an independent nation since an April day in 1822, when a well-aimed shot from their depluralizing cannon reduced the British colonizing fleet to one ship.

Since then, Atlantis has been the world's greatest center for linguistic manipulation, designing letter inserters, word synthesizers, the diminutive affixer, and a host of other tools for converting one thing to another. Inventors worldwide pay heavily for that technology, which is where a smuggler and industrial espionage agent such as yourself can really clean up.

Unfortunately, the Bureau of Orthography has taken a serious interest in your activities lately. Your face has been recorded and your cover is blown.

Your remaining assets: about eight more hours of a national holiday that's spreading the police thin; the most inconvenient damn disguise you've ever worn in your life; and one full-alphabet letter remover. 

Good luck getting off the island."

Release along with a file of "Customs Poster" called "Customs-Poster-Big.png", a file of "DCL Advertisement" called "DCLbig.png", a file of "Atlantida Poster" called "Atlantida.png", cover art, the library card, source text, and a website.

Chapter 3 - Undo Handling

[Some interpreters do not allocate enough memory to allow Counterfeit Monkey to UNDO successfully after a turn has gone wrong. To make matters worse, sometimes UNDO stops working partway through a playthrough when it did work at the beginning. 

Ultra Undo is an extension kindly written by Dannii Willis to use external file recording to ensure that UNDO remains available.]

Include version 1/160429 of Ultra Undo by Dannii Willis.

Section 1 - Compass Rose

[The aim of the graphics is to provide the player with visual orientation. We don't ever want the player to feel lost or to feel pressure to take notes. With a large game space, this is a challenge to achieve. Even though Bronze provided GO TO and FIND commands *and* came with a manual with a pre-drawn map, a number of players reported making maps of their own. This was a failure. Note-taking should be completely unnecessary unless the player happens to enjoy map-making for some reason.

The map concept borrows from commercial game minimaps that show goal locations as the player progresses.

Like the compass rose in Bronze, the compass rose here shows exits in different shades depending on whether the rooms in those directions have already been visited. The compass is also hyperlinked so that the player can click on it as an alternative to typing directions. ]

[The following is a hack. Originally the figure name associations were all properties of the direction objects, but some sort of memory bug happened when image properties were added to the nautical directions. The result was that the map itself was reconfigured weirdly -- for instance, Slango's Head was declared in source to be aft from Slango's Bunk, but in the game model it would be port of Slango's Bunk instead.]

When play begins (this is the setting drawing-rule rule):
	now current graphics drawing rule is the compass-drawing rule.
	
Carry out going (this is the update compass on movement rule):  
	refresh compass with current directions.
	
Carry out someone going when the actor encloses the player:
	refresh compass with current directions.

[We want the compass to stay down in a corner of the screen and not to scale up too huge if the screen is resized. One of the irritating things about Glulx window management is that it's impossible to force an aspect ratio on the player, so I have no idea whether they're going to go tall-and-skinny or short-and-wide. Testers playing in full-screen mode sometimes found that the compass got way too large and encroached on the upper part of the map if I just set the compass to be one quarter the width of the window.]

To decide what number is grid-size: 
	let width-quarter be (current graphics window width / 4);
	let height-quarter be (current graphics window height / 4);
	if width-quarter is greater than height-quarter:
		now compass width is height-quarter;
	else:
		now compass width is width-quarter; 
	let D be compass width / 3;
	decide on D;
	
To decide what number is grid-margin:
	decide on grid-size / 2.

This is the compass-drawing rule:
	if glulx graphics is supported:
		clear compass graphlinks; [We need to reset the graphlinks every time the player resizes the window, because if the height of the screen changes, the compass may move vertically.]
		establish compass graphlinks; 
		refresh compass with current directions.

To determine compass coordinates:
	let ZE be 0;
	increase ZE by grid-margin;
	let D be grid-size;
	let DD be 2 * D;
	let DDD be compass width;
	let TE be current graphics window height - (D * 4); 
	let UM be TE + D; 
	let LM be TE + DD;
	let BEE be current graphics window height - D; 
	increase D by grid-margin;
	increase DD by grid-margin;
	increase DDD by grid-margin;
	change x-coordinate of up to ZE; 
	change y-coordinate of up to BEE;
	change x-coordinate of down to DD; 
	change y-coordinate of down to BEE; 
	change x-coordinate of fore-port to ZE; 
	change y-coordinate of fore-port to TE;
	change x-coordinate of fore to D; 
	change y-coordinate of fore to TE;
	change x-coordinate of fore-starboard to DD; 
	change y-coordinate of fore-starboard to TE;
	change x-coordinate of port to ZE; 
	change y-coordinate of port to UM;
	change x-coordinate of starboard to DD; 
	change y-coordinate of starboard to UM;
	change x-coordinate of aft-port to ZE; 
	change y-coordinate of aft-port to LM;
	change x-coordinate of aft to D; 
	change y-coordinate of aft to LM;
	change x-coordinate of aft-starboard to DD; 
	change y-coordinate of aft-starboard to LM; 
	change x-coordinate of northwest to ZE; 
	change y-coordinate of northwest to TE;
	change x-coordinate of north to D; 
	change y-coordinate of north to TE;
	change x-coordinate of northeast to DD; 
	change y-coordinate of northeast to TE;
	change x-coordinate of west to ZE; 
	change y-coordinate of west to UM;
	change x-coordinate of east to DD; 
	change y-coordinate of east to UM;
	change x-coordinate of southwest to ZE; 
	change y-coordinate of southwest to LM;
	change x-coordinate of south to D; 
	change y-coordinate of south to LM;
	change x-coordinate of southeast to DD; 
	change y-coordinate of southeast to LM. 

[Layer the image: black in the background to fill in the top of the screen; a blue and black mix of the right height across the whole width of the screen so that if the map is too small, it will still look blue at the edges; then the map itself, proportionally scaled as large as it can reasonably be given the window dimensions; then the compass, built from the current circumstances.

In theory, it would have been possible to make the map images carry the compass directions as well. In practice, that presented several problems: more difficult to cope with minor map changes during final revisions, inability to indicate which directions have already been explored.]
To refresh compass with current directions:
	if glulx graphics is supported: 
		blank window to graphics background color;
		change currently shown picture to the figure of background;
		follow the bottom wide drawing rule;
		change currently shown picture to the local map of the location;
		follow the bottom scaled drawing rule;
		draw Figure of center-squiggle from the x-coordinate of north by y-coordinate of west to grid-size by grid-size; 
		determine compass coordinates;
		repeat with way running through directions:
			if the way is a listable exit: 
				let X be the x-coordinate of way;
				let Y be the y-coordinate of way;
				if the room way from the location is visited:
					draw the visited image of the way from X by Y to grid-size by grid-size; 
				otherwise:
					draw the unvisited image of the way from X by Y to grid-size by grid-size;  

Section 2 - Local Maps

A room has a figure-name called the local map. [Actual file names and assignments are made later, after all the rooms have been defined.]

[Simple Graphical Window provides instructions for scaling an image and putting it in the middle of the screen if the aspect ratio of the window it needs to fill is slightly wrong. In this case, though, we want to put the map at the bottom of the screen and fill the background above it with black, so there is no apparent top and bottom margin at all.]

This is the bottom wide drawing rule:
	draw wide image in graphics window;

To draw wide image in graphics window:
	(- ScaleToBottomWide(); -)

This is the bottom scaled drawing rule:
	draw bottom scaled image in graphics window.

To draw bottom scaled image in graphics window:
	(- ScaleToBottom(); -)

Chapter 2 - Sounds

[Once upon a time, when this was a much smaller and more comedic game, I was going to have sound effects communicating successes and failures with the various letter-manipulating instruments. But then the tone of the game changed and the game itself got a lot longer, and it felt like the cuteness of this would wear off long before hour eight or so of play. 

Also, not all interpreters support Glulx sound, so I would have had to commit to a lot of extra testing work in order to get anything done in this line.

Ultimately it didn't seem worth it and the sounds were scrapped from the gameplay. I did have a fun afternoon once picking royalty-free sounds from a special effects database, though.]

[Sound of record scratch is the file "scratch14.aif".
Sound of sudden growth is the file "maximize04.aif".
Sound of scope success is the file "organic_nav_16.aif".
Sound of scope failure is the file "hi-tech_05.aif".
Sound of gel splort is the file "pop_15.aif". ]

Chapter 3 - Typographical Conveniences

Section 1 - Output Shorthand

[For changes of style and certain unicode elements that we might want to invoke in the middle of other output, we define a few say phrases to make them easier to type. ]

Use American dialect and the serial comma. 

To say i -- beginning say_i -- running on: (- style underline; -). 
To say /i -- ending say_i -- running on: (- style roman; -). 
To say b -- beginning say_b -- running on: (- style bold; -). 
To say /b -- ending say_b -- running on: (- style roman; -).

en dash translates into Unicode as 8211.
em dash translates into Unicode as 8212.
ballot x translates into Unicode as 10007.

To say --: say Unicode em dash.
To say -: say Unicode en dash.
To say -x-: say Unicode ballot x.

Rule for deciding whether all includes fixed in place things: it does not.
Rule for deciding whether all includes scenery: it does not.
Rule for deciding whether all includes people while taking: it does not.

Rule for clarifying the parser's choice of something:
	do nothing instead. 
	

To say set prior to (item - a thing):
	now prior named noun is item.

Section 2 - Input Editing

[There are a number of situations -- when typing a question with a ? at the end, in a command like TYPE "BROWN" ON COMPUTER, etc. -- where we want to throw away any punctuation that the player has added to the input, and no situations in which we want to keep it (except for full stops, which might indicate the beginning of another command). So we edit those out.]

Include Punctuation Removal by Emily Short.

First after reading a command:
	remove stray punctuation.
	
Section 3 - Styles

[Borrowed from Alabaster's version of the same thing.] 

Table of User Styles (continued)
style name	justification	obliquity	indentation	first-line indentation	boldness	fixed width	relative size	glulx color 
special-style-1	left-justified	--	0	0	--	--	0	g-medium-grey
special-style-2	left-justified	italic-obliquity	0	0	light-weight	proportional-font	0	g-dark-grey

Before listing plausible quips [when dialogue tinting is true]:
	say "[second custom style][run paragraph on]".
	
After listing plausible quips [when dialogue tinting is true]:
	if a paragraph break is pending:
		say "[roman type]";
	otherwise:
		say "[roman type][run paragraph on]".
		
Before listing matched quips:
	say "[second custom style][run paragraph on]".

After listing matched quips:
	if a paragraph break is pending:
		say "[roman type]";
	otherwise:
		say "[roman type][run paragraph on]".
		
Section 4 - Bolding Help

[The names of manipulable objects are especially important in this game, and it's possible for the reader to miss clues through careless reading or misunderstanding. So, as with Bronze and several of Aaron Reed's games, we bracket objects in descriptions and provide a facility to mark the names of implemented items in bold.]

Boldening is a truth state that varies. Boldening is false.

Before printing the name of a direction when boldening is true:
	say "[bold type]"
	
After printing the name of a direction when boldening is true:
	say "[roman type]"
	

Before printing the name of something which is not a quip when boldening is true:
	say "[bold type]"
	
After printing the name of something which is not a quip when boldening is true:
	say "[roman type]"
	
[This is a hack to get around a bug that I find wholly inexplicable and may be happening at the interpreter level, whereby "HIGHLIGHT" is assigned to the score notification action though it should not be, and appears correctly in the phrasebook.]
After reading a command:
	if the player's command includes "highlight":
		replace the matched text with "hilight".
	
Understand "highlighting on" or "hilighting on" or "hilight on" as turning on highlighting. Turning on highlighting is an action out of world.
	
Understand "highlighting off" or "hilighting off" or "hilight off" as turning off highlighting. Turning off highlighting is an action out of world.

Understand "highlighting" or "hilighting" or "hilight" or "highlight" as turning on highlighting when boldening is false.

Understand "highlighting" or "hilighting" or "hilight" or "highlight" as turning off highlighting when boldening is true.

Carry out turning on highlighting:
	now boldening is true.
	
Carry out turning off highlighting:
	now boldening is false.
	
Report turning on highlighting:
	say "Highlighting of object names is now on."

Report turning off highlighting:
	say "Highlighting of object names is now off."

[And suppose we want this to be functional for just a single turn and then turn off again:]

Understand "look carefully" or "look closely" as bold looking. Bold looking is an action applying to nothing.

Carry out bold looking:
	let already-bold-flag be false;
	if boldening is true:
		let already-bold-flag be true;
	now boldening is true;
	try looking;
	unless already-bold-flag is true:
		now boldening is false.



Part 3 - Status

Section 1 - The Status Line

To fill the/-- status bar/line with (selected table - Table of Fancy Status):  
	repeat through selected table: 
		move cursor to 1;
		say "[left entry]"; 
		right align cursor to 1;
		say "[right entry]"; 
		
When play begins:
	change right alignment depth to 20.
	
Table of Fancy Status
left	central	right 
" [location], [current daytime]"	""	"Goals: [count of pending tasks]  Score: [score]" 

Rule for constructing the status line:
	fill status bar with Table of Fancy Status;
	rule succeeds.
	
Section 2 - Score

[Score is pretty old-school here: it marks progress towards the end game and provides the player with a review of significant achievements so far, as well as encouraging the player that he did the right thing at certain junctures. 

Optional accomplishments are not included -- those are reserved for the achievement system -- so there are no Last Lousy Points. A player who gets to the end of the game should have the full hundred.]

The new notify score changes rule is listed instead of the notify score changes rule in the turn sequence rulebook.

This is the new notify score changes rule:
	if the score is not the last notified score:
		say "[first custom style]";
		let diff be the score minus the last notified score;
		if diff is less than 0:
			let diff be 0 minus diff;
			say "[bracket]Your score has gone down by [diff in words] point[s][if score is greater than diff] and is now [score in words][end if].[close bracket]";
		otherwise:
			say "[bracket]Your score has gone up by [diff in words] point[s][if score is greater than diff] and is now [score in words][end if].[close bracket]";
		say "[roman type][paragraph break]";
		now the last notified score is the score;

Section 4 - Achievements

[Achievement file handling is adapted from the Recorded Endings extension used in Alabaster.]

The File of Conclusions is called "monkeyac".

When play begins (this is the load conclusions when starting rule):
	read the achievements.

Last carry out restoring the game (this is the load conclusions when restoring rule):
	read the achievements.

To read the achievements:
	if the File of Conclusions exists:
		read File of Conclusions into the Table of Possible Achievements.
	
To record (slug - some text) as an achievement:
	read the achievements;
	let N be indexed text;
	let N be "[slug]";
	unless N is a used achievement:
		choose a blank row in the Table of Possible Achievements;
		now the achievement entry is N;
		unless the location is nautical:
			say "[first custom style][line break]Achievement accomplished: [N]![line break][roman type]";
	write File of Conclusions from the Table of Possible Achievements.

	no. 

This is the list sources rule:
	say "I started working in earnest on this game in 2008. Since that time, the US has undergone two presidential elections; for months, the Occupy Seattle protests filled a city block just a short stroll from my apartment; and the successes and failures of the Arab Spring were constantly in the news. These experiences introduced more serious themes into what was initially a purely silly game. 

Gene Sharp's [i]From Dictatorship to Democracy[/i] and the documentary [i]How to Start a Revolution[/i] helped me think about peaceful revolutions and the communication of dissent within totalitarian regimes.

The history of Atlantis['] colon[ization] mirrors that of nearby Gibraltar, on the theory that the same powers would have been likely to take an interest. Wikipedia supplied most of the potted history I used for this.

Arika Okrent's [i]In the Land of Invented Languages[/i] and Mark Rosenfelder's [i]Language Construction Kit[/i] (first a website, subsequently a book) taught me a lot about existing constructed languages and helped me imagine what might interest Atlantean academics.

[i]Poor Economics[/i] (Abhijit Banerjee, Esther Duflo) provided some general background about different attempts to address global poverty, contributing to the Atlantean concept of utopian linguistics (and why it hadn't yet saved the world).

The Scrabble dictionary and the internet anagram server, among others, helped me map out the puzzle space systematically. 

Hundreds of other small details came out of YouTube or Wikipedia, from the composition of classic cocktails to the mating behavior of pigs. Background for specific elements may be found in the game's source text."
 

Section 5 - Inventory Options 

Inventory listing style is a kind of value. The inventory listing styles are tall, wide, and utilitarian. Current inventory listing style is an inventory listing style that varies. Current inventory listing style is utilitarian.

Understand "inventory [inventory listing style]" as requesting styled inventory. Requesting styled inventory is an action applying to an inventory listing style, out of world.

Carry out requesting styled inventory:
	now current inventory listing style is the inventory listing style understood.

Report requesting styled inventory:
	say "Inventory listing is now set to [current inventory listing style]."

[We begin by emulating the standard inventory listing style:]

Instead of taking inventory when current inventory listing style is tall:
	if the number of things enclosed by the player is 0, say "[You] [are] empty-handed." instead;
	say "[You] [are] carrying: [line break]";
	list the contents of the player, with newlines, indented, giving inventory information, including contents, with extra indentation.

Instead of taking inventory when the current inventory listing style is wide:
	if the number of things enclosed by the player is 0, say "[You] [are] empty-handed." instead;
	say "[You] [are] wearing ";
	now all things enclosed by the player are unmarked for listing;
	now all things worn by the player are marked for listing;
	if no things worn by the player are marked for listing, say "nothing special";
	otherwise list the contents of the player, as a sentence, listing marked items only;
	say ".[paragraph break]";
	say "[You] [are] carrying ";
	now all things carried by the player are marked for listing;
	now all things worn by the player are unmarked for listing;
	if no things carried by the player are marked for listing, say "nothing";
	otherwise list the contents of the player, as a sentence, tersely, giving brief inventory information, including contents, listing marked items only;
	say ".[paragraph break]". 
	
Instead of taking inventory when the current inventory listing style is utilitarian:
	now everything is not marked for listing;
	let packed count be 0;
	let unpacked count be 0;
	if the number of things enclosed by the player is 0, say "[You] [are] empty-handed." instead;
	now all essential things enclosed by the player are marked for listing; 
	unless the number of marked for listing things is 0::
		if exactly one thing is marked for listing:
			say "[You] [are] equipped with [a list of marked for listing thing] [--] an essential [you] mustn't part with.[paragraph break]";
		otherwise:
			say "[You] [are] equipped with the following essentials: [a list of marked for listing things].[paragraph break]";
		now packed count is the number of marked for listing things which are packed;
		now unpacked count is the number of marked for listing things which are unpacked;
	now everything is not marked for listing; 
	now every not essential thing enclosed by the player is marked for listing;
	now everything that is part of something is not marked for listing;
	now the restoration gel is not marked for listing; [because the tub will already be a mentioned essential]
	unless no things are marked for listing:
		say "[You] [are] also carrying ";
		repeat with item running through marked for listing things:
			choose a blank row in the Table of Inventory Ordering;
			let N be indexed text;
			let N be "[item]";
			let N be "[N in lower case]";
			now the name appearance entry is N;
			now the referent entry is the item;
			if item is packed, increase packed count by 1;
			else increase unpacked count by 1;
		sort the Table of Inventory Ordering in name appearance order;
		let count be 0;
		let max be the number of filled rows in the Table of Inventory Ordering;
		let near-max be max minus 1;
		repeat through the Table of Inventory Ordering:
			say "[a referent entry]";
			increase count by 1;
			if count is max:
				say ".";
			otherwise if count is near-max:
				say ", and ";
			otherwise:
				say ", ";
			blank out the whole row;
	if the player carries the backpack:
		say line break;
		if packed count is greater than unpacked count:
			if the unpacked count is 0:
				say "Everything [you] carry is in the backpack, which is [if backpack is closed]closed for greater concealment[else]gaping wide open so everyone can see what's inside[end if]. [no line break]";
			else:
				say "Everything [you] carry is in the backpack except [the list of unpacked things which are enclosed by the player]. The backpack is [if backpack is closed]closed for greater concealment[else]gaping wide open so everyone can see what's inside[end if]. [no line break]";
		else:
			if packed count is 0:
				say "None of that is in the backpack. [no line break]";
			else:
				say "Of that collection, [the list of packed things] [is-are] packed away in the backpack, which is [if backpack is closed]closed for greater concealment[else]gaping wide open so everyone can see what's inside[end if]. [no line break]";
	if the player wears something:
		if packed count is 0:
			say line break;
		say "We're wearing [the list of things worn by the player].";
	else if the packed count is greater than 0 or the player carries the backpack:
		say paragraph break.
			

Test newutility with "tutorial off / i / put all in backpack / i / wave l-remover at plans / put pans in backpack / i / put all in backpack / i / close backpack / i / x backpack / open backpack / x backpack / i / wear wig / i / wear monocle / i / drop backpack / i / x me" holding the backpack and the secret-plans and the lime and the cate and the wig.
		
Definition: a thing is packed if it is enclosed by the backpack and it is not part of something.
Definition: a thing is unpacked if it is not packed and it is not part of something and it is not the backpack.

After printing the name of the tub while taking inventory:
	if the current inventory listing style is utilitarian:

Part 4 - Extras

Section 1 - Footnotes

[Once there were footnotes, using Stephen Granade's Footnotes extension. But I took them out. Most of what I wanted to explain seemed much better placed as comments in the source, where it wouldn't spoil anything that wasn't being spoiled anyway.]

Section 2 - Hard Mode

[ Counterfeit Monkey is designed to be fairly accessible -- this is a primary design concern for the puzzles and user interface. The implication of that, though, is that the game is likely to be easier than some hard-core puzzle aficionadoes are likely to prefer; and, of course, there are a lot of possible solutions that are substantially more obscure than others, which players are unlikely to find unless forced.

So we also provide a hard mode, to offer a more focused puzzle experience for the people, one that will hopefully still be fun if the player chooses to revisit it after having already finished easy mode. To that end, there are a few mild jokes that riff on easy-mode gameplay, and a few puzzles are swapped entirely for something new and harder.]

Understand "hard" or "hard mode" or "expert" or "harder" or "difficult" or "expert mode" or "harder mode" or "difficult mode" as selecting hard mode. Selecting hard mode is an action out of world.

Check selecting hard mode when the Fair is visited:
	say "It is now too late in the game to change modes. If you wish, you may restart the game and choose HARD any time before reaching the Fair." instead.
	
Hardness is a truth state that varies.

Check selecting hard mode when the Fair is not visited:
	if hardness is true:
		say "Hard mode is already on." instead;
	say "Once you've selected hard mode, you can't go back: certain puzzles with multiple solutions will be made more difficult and some puzzles will be altered entirely. Are you sure? >>";
	unless the player consents:
		say "Hard mode selection canceled." instead.
	
[Implementing hard mode is largely a matter of deleting a number of the most obviously useful items from the game, forcing the player to look for alternative options that may be more difficult to find. In a couple of cases, we replace the useful item with something else as a bit of a tease. The list of things we take out of play:
 
FUNNEL (FUEL)
STICKY (STICK)
BANANA (BANDANA)
WRAP (RAP)
SCREWDRIVER
PEAR (PEARL etc.)
WHEEL
TOMES
TWIG
FOSSIL (OIL)
GUM

CLOCK (still included, but it gains the adjective BROKEN after its first gelling, and is not useful for the Waterstone puzzle, forcing the player to work with ASS or MEMBER instead.)

Hard mode also changes the functionality of the vowel rotator in the late game, replacing it with a somewhat more challenging encryptor.]

Carry out selecting hard mode:
	now hardness is true;   
	remove the gum from play;
	remove the funnel from play;
	now the funnel is not buried;
	now the printed name of the twig is "bent twig"; 
	now the printed name of the fossil is "twisty fossil";
	now the printed name of the tomes is "dusty tomes";
	remove the sticky from play; 
	remove the banana from play;
	move the pineapple to the large carton; 
	remove the wrap from play;
	remove the screwdriver from play;
	remove the screwdrivers from play; 
	move the prickly-pear to the holder of the pear;
	remove the pear from play; 
	remove the wheel from play;
	now the introduction of the clock is "It's stopped working sometime in the recent past, possibly thanks to its fall when we gelled it.";
	follow the initialize hash codes rule;
	now tutorial mode is false;
	
Report selecting hard mode:
	say "[story title] is now in 'hard' mode. Tutorials are off. The world is reconfigured against you. Good luck." 
	
Test hardnames with "tutorial off / hard / y / drop all / look / look carefully / x bent twig / x broken clock / wave t-remover at twig / wave l-remover at clock / wave m-remover at tomes / wave s-remover at members / wave y-remover at army" holding the twig and the clock and the tomes and the members and the army.
Test hard2 with "tutorial off / hard / y / autoupgrade / wave p-remover at patron / wave m-remover at patron / z / wave m-remover at patron" in the drinks club.
	
Understand "model" as the members when hardness is true.
Understand "model" as the army when hardness is true.
	
Understand "bent" as the twig when hardness is true.  
Understand "dusty" as the tomes when hardness is true.  
Understand "twisty" as the fossil when hardness is true.

Before printing the name of the clock when hardness is true and printed name of the clock is not "broken clock":
	if the clock is in the repository:
		make no decision;
	otherwise:
		now the printed name of the clock is "broken clock";
		reset hash code of the clock;
		
Understand "broken" as the clock when hardness is true.

[We can't actually go back to easy mode once we're in hard mode, but we should react to the player's attempts to do so.]

Understand "easy" or "easy mode" or "mode" as selecting easy mode. Selecting easy mode is an action out of world.

Check selecting easy mode:
	if hardness is false:
		say "Easy mode is the default mode for [story title], and is already active." instead;
	otherwise:
		say "Once hard mode is selected, it cannot be turned off. Please restart if you would prefer to play the game in easy mode." instead.

Section 3 - About Menu

Include Basic Help Menu by Emily Short.

When play begins:
	choose row 1 in Table of Basic Help Options;
	change description entry to "[story title] is a puzzle game about word manipulation, with moderate plot complexity. It will probably take a seasoned IF player at least eight hours to complete. 

This game is fairly gentle: it should not be possible to get stuck or make the game unexpectedly unwinnable; if an object you thought was useful goes away, odds are that you can live without it or that you'll have an opportunity to get it back. 

There are a handful of timed situations in the story. When these occur, you will probably be well aware of the fact. If you feel threatened, save the game." 

	Table of Basic Help Options (continued)
	title	subtable	description
	"Commands specific to this game"	--	"[story title] mostly uses commands standard in interactive fiction, so someone familiar with these should be at ease. The chief exceptions have to do with navigation and communicating with other characters. 
	
INVENTORY TALL, INVENTORY WIDE and INVENTORY UTILITARIAN change the way inventory listing is presented. By default, the inventory list is set to utilitarian, presenting your possessions in two groups (tools and other things), and alphabetizing the output.
	
In a location, LOOK CAREFULLY will print the room description with object names in bold. If you would like to experience the whole game this way, try HIGHLIGHTING ON.
	
GO TO a location will take us to the place named, even if that's some distance away. 

EXITS will list the currently available exits as text. You should also be able to see these in the compass rose of the graphical window, assuming you are using one.

Sometimes you will recollect things. MEMORIES will list currently available memories, and REMEMBER will play the results.

TALK TO GIRL or GIRL, HELLO will start a conversation with a person who isn't already talking to us. 

ASK ABOUT or TELL ABOUT let us talk about subjects that interest us, once the conversation has started. ASK GIRL ABOUT CHECKERS or TELL GIRL ABOUT ME will work, as will the more abbreviated forms ASK ABOUT CHECKERS, TELL ABOUT ME, or even just A CHECKERS and T ME.

There will sometimes be prompts, like 'You could ask about whether margarine is better than butter.', in which case ASK WHETHER MARGARINE IS BETTER THAN BUTTER will work, but so will a shorter subset like ASK ABOUT BUTTER, as long as it uniquely identifies the question you want to ask. The topics listed during a conversation are not the complete list of available things to say, just the list of things that seem most relevant at the moment.

If you'd like to play in hard mode, with some alternate puzzle solutions removed and other puzzles changed entirely, type HARD during the first few rooms of the game. After that point, it is too late to qualify for hard mode, and you'll need to restart if you wish to activate it."
	"Testing Credits"	--	"I had a great team of testers to work over the gameplay: Sam Kabo Ashwell, Richard Evans, John Ferguson, Admiral Jota, Jacqueline A. Lott, Kate McKee, Jim Munroe, Mark Musante, Chris Nelson, Graham Nelson, Peter Nelson, Toby Nelson, Zach Samuels, and David Welbourn. As well as catching many errors, the team suggested additional responses and easter eggs, provided valuable help with puzzle design and story development, and offered moral support. 

I am indebted to the following players for suggestions and bug reports that affected subsequent releases: Draconis, dydt, Guy, Joe, Josh, Matthias, Malor, Weeble, Bruce Addison, Lea Albaugh, Sam Barlow, Sasha Beker, Josiah Boning, Taus Brock-Nannestad, Matthew Carson, Liza Daly, Justin de Vesine, Jason Dyer, Dan Fabulich, Jeremy Freese, Stephen Granade, Admiral Jota, Jacqueline A.

Shore, David Simon, Lucian P. Smith, Michael Sokolov, David Steltzer, Adam Thornton, Matt Weiner, David Welbourn, Matthias Wenigweiser.

Any remaining flaws are my fault alone."
	"Other Credits"	--	"Counterfeit Monkey uses Inform extensions by Graham Nelson, David Fisher, Aaron Reed, Jim Aikin, Gavin Lambert, Jon Ingold, and Jeff Sheets. To read a complete list of these extensions and their version information, type VERSION at the command line.
	
A number of other IF community members helped me trouble-shoot specific issues. Jason Dyer worked over one specific easter egg for me. Andrew Hunter and Andrew Plotkin diagnosed a problem running the game under Git. Dannii Willis and Ben Cressey helped with figuring out why UNDO wasn't working on Gargoyle. Graham Nelson provided a hashing solution that made object name comparisons run a great deal faster as the number of objects in the game climbed over 1500. Their assistance is much appreciated.

The in-game maps use a variety of readily available fonts. Some of the more esoteric of these came from the HP Lovecraft Historical Society Font Pack. 

My sister created the Atlantida poster.
	
There are three cameo appearances by IF community members (or their alter egos). These people bid for the opportunity to appear, as part of a fundraiser for a heart surgery patient who was without medical insurance. They are Mark Musante, John Ferguson, and Kate McKee, and I wish to thank them again for their generosity."

Section 4 - Resurrection

[In versions 1-4 of the game, it was possible to die instantly in assorted ways. On an interpreter with working UNDO, it was possible to take this turn back, but a) some novice players may not realize this and b) some interpreters choked on trying to undo things given how very large the game state is.]

To undo a turn:
	(- Perform_Undo(); -).

When play ends when the story has not ended finally:
	wait for any key;
	say "That is, that's what would have happened if [you] had done something so foolish. Shall we suppose [you] didn't? >"; 
	if the player consents:
		if the turn count is greater than 1:
			say "[line break]";
			undo a turn; 
		otherwise:
			resume the story;
		try looking.

I'm just... not interested.[or]It's like this: you're attractive, but you're also scary. I'm not a big risk-taker, which is why I needed you in the first place.[or]Could [you] stop talking about this?[stopping]".
	
Instead of tasting the player:
	say "I don't know about you, but I try not to be seen licking myself. And I count your presence as company."
	
Instead of attacking the player:
	say "Not while I'm in here too."
	
Instead of taking the player:
	say "I don't see how [you] could do that."

Section 3 - Conversational Greetings

[ The player encounters characters under three basic circumstances (though there can be some overlap between these):

1) The character is manufactured by the player as the result of a letter transformation. (See "Manufactured People".) Manufactured people are not expected to do terribly much, as a rule, though one or two do have a function (the mechanic especially).
2) The character hangs out in a particular room almost all the time. (See "Open Access Characters".)
3) The character is moved on-stage by a scene event and then removed again when the scene is over. 

A small handful of characters are one and then the other -- for instance, you can visit Higgate in her office as much as you like until you've triggered off certain essential events with her, after which she reappears only for scene reasons.

In this section we create some actions for saying hello to new characters, and then promptly try to ensure that the player doesn't have to use them much. 

Characters who are "alert" will notice and greet the player when he comes into the area, and as this makes them seem more lively and reduces the amount of player effort, it's almost always desirable. We also add a text property so that people can have their own characteristic greetings.]

A person can be alert.

Definition: a person is alarmed if he is alert and he is not the current interlocutor.

Every turn when an alarmed person (called the prospective interlocutor) is enclosed by the location:
	try the prospective interlocutor saying hello to the player.

The new default greeting rule is listed instead of the default greeting rule in the report saying hello to rules.

Report saying hello to someone when the greeting type is explicit (this is the new default greeting rule):
	say "[You] [one of]say [one of]hello[or]hi[or]hey[at random] to[or]wave at[or]nod to[or]greet[purely at random] [the noun].[paragraph break][greeting of the noun][paragraph break]";
	
Report someone saying hello to the player:
	say "[greeting of the actor][paragraph break]" instead;
	

A person has some text called the greeting. The greeting of a person is usually "'[one of]Hi[or]Hello[or]Hi there[at random],' [the actor] say[s].".

The greeting of the player is "'Hi,' [you] say."
	
The report someone saying hello rule is not listed in any rulebook.
	 
The can't greet current interlocutor rule is not listed in any rulebook. The check hailing rule is not listed in any rulebook.

Check hailing (this is the new check hailing rule):
	if the current interlocutor is a visible person:
		if the current quip is generic-quip:
			now the current quip is the greet-quip;
			say "[You] [one of]nod[or]wave[or]smile and acknowledge [the current interlocutor][or]say hi[or]return the greeting[at random]." instead; 
		say already-have instead;
	change the noun to a random visible person who is not the player;
	if the noun is a person then 
		say "(addressing [the noun])";
	otherwise say "There's no one here but you." instead.
	
Check saying hello to someone who is not the current interlocutor when the current interlocutor is alert:
	say "[The noun] [is-are] already included in the conversation." instead.

Check starting a conversation with clientele about something:
	say "They're... busy. At best interrupting them would interrupt their code, and at worst it would make them think [you] [are] a Bureau agent." instead.
	
Test clientele-bug with "ask parker about slango / ask men about slango" in the Counterfeit Monkey.

Carry out starting a conversation with an eavesdropping person about when the current interlocutor is a person:
	say "[You] give [the noun] a look to say [its-their] input would be welcome as well.";
	now the reborn command is "ask about [topic understood]";
	now sp reparse flag is true instead.

[We do want it to be possible for the player to say "hi" back to a character who has just greeted him if the conversation has just started.]

Check saying hello to a person when the noun is the current interlocutor (this is the new can't greet current interlocutor rule):
	if the current quip is generic-quip:
		now the current quip is the greet-quip;
		say "[You] [one of]nod[or]wave[or]smile[or]say hi[or]return the greeting[at random]." instead; 
	say already-have instead.
	
To say already-have:
	say "[You] already have the attention of [the current interlocutor][if a person is eavesdropping], not to mention the curiosity of [the list of eavesdropping people][end if]."
	
Definition: a person is eavesdropping if it is not the player and it is not the current interlocutor and it is enclosed by the location.
	
The greet-quip is a privately-named quip. The greet-quip is unlisted. The printed name of the greet-quip is "greetings".

Understand "wave to/at [something]" as waving to. Waving to is an action applying to one visible thing. 

Sanity-check waving to a person:
	try saying hello to the noun instead.

Sanity-check waving to something:
	say "[The noun] appear[s] very unlikely to respond." instead.
 
Test secondaries with "tutorial off / z / say hello / g / ask about paddle / say hello to mark / ask mark about mark / ask mark about the paddle / test customer" in the Drinks Club.

Test customer with "z / ask about maps / say hello to customer / ask customer about maps / say hello to papas / ask papas about maps" holding the map-customer and the papas in Arbot.

Test all-greetings with "all-greet".


Section 4 - Facts and Motives

[For many of the scattered characters, they're going to try to work out what you want from them and behave according to that script, whatever it turns out to be. Shop sellers will assume that you're a possible customer and use that script until you defy it; that kind of thing.]

To decide what fact is the ostensible motive:
	if the current interlocutor knows a motivational fact (called the probable motive):   
		decide on the probable motive;
	otherwise: 
		decide on generic-truth. [The guy wants to know why we're talking to him like this]

Table of All Known Facts (continued)

A fact can be motivational or purposeless. A fact is usually purposeless. you-are-student, you-hit-on, you-are-tourist, you-are-possible-customer, you-are-past-customer, you-take-survey, you-are-feckless, you-are-dangerous are motivational.

Assumption relates various quips to various facts. The verb to assume (it assumes, they assume, it assumed, it is assumed) implies the assumption relation.

An availability rule for a quip (called the target):
	if the target assumes a fact which is not known by the player, it is off-limits.

Section 5 - Generic Response Types


A person has some text called the generic negative. The generic negative of a person is usually "[one of]no[or]not really[at random]".
A person has some text called the generic positive. The generic positive of a person is usually "[one of]yes[or]sure[at random]". 
A person has some text called the generic adversative. The generic adversative of a person is usually "well".
A person has some text called the secondary apology. The secondary apology of a person is usually "".
A person has some text called the generic confrontational. The generic confrontational of a person is usually "look".

To say Well:
	let N be indexed text;
	let N be "[generic adversative of the current interlocutor]";
	let N be "[N in sentence case]";
	say "[N]".

To say personal no:
	let N be indexed text;
	let N be "[generic negative of the current interlocutor]";
	let N be "[N in sentence case]";
	say "[N]".
	
To say personal yes:
	let N be  indexed text;
	let N be "[generic positive of the current interlocutor]";
	let N be "[N in sentence case]";
	say "[N]".
	
To say awkward no:
	let N be indexed text;
	let N be "[generic adversative of the current interlocutor], [generic negative of the current interlocutor]";
	let N be "[N in sentence case]";
	say "[N][apologetic]"; 
	
To say awkward yes:
	let N be indexed text;
	let N be "[generic adversative of the current interlocutor], [generic positive of the current interlocutor]";
	let N be "[N in sentence case]";
	say "[N][apologetic]";
	
To say apologetic:
	if the secondary apology of the current interlocutor is not "":
		say ", [secondary apology of the current interlocutor]";
		
To say awkward confrontation:
	let N be indexed text;
	let N be "[generic confrontational of the current interlocutor]";
	let N be "[N in sentence case]";  
	say "[N]";
	

To say ignorance:
	carry out the expressing ignorance for activity with the current interlocutor;
	say "[run paragraph on]"
 

Section 6 - Varieties of Person

[Most of the characters in the game fall into one of four categories: native, tourist, criminal, police. These categories allow us to define appropriate behavior for the "universal reactions" where there aren't individual separately-coded responses for every character.]

A person can be native, tourist, criminal, or police. A person is usually native.

Rule for expressing ignorance for a tourist person:
	say "[one of]'You might be better off asking someone else[or]'I really don't know a lot about that[or]'I'm pretty new around here myself[at random],' says [the current interlocutor].[run paragraph on]"
	
Rule for expressing ignorance for a police person:
	say "[one of]'That's official information[or]'There are security reasons why I can't discuss that[or]'I'd have to ask my manager[or]'We aren't supposed to answer questions of that sort[at random],' says [the current interlocutor].[run paragraph on]"
	

When play begins:
	[now every person in the zoo is tourist;
	now every person in the Customs House is police;]
	now every person in Official Grounds is police.
	
[Characters also have certain traits, which may occur in combination or alone and are not mutually exclusive, and which govern reactions to common questions.]

A conversation trait is a kind of value. The conversation traits are unhelpfulness, privacy, courtesy, caution, and vanity.

Exhibition relates various people to various conversation traits. The verb to exhibit (it exhibits, they exhibit, it exhibited, it is exhibited) implies the exhibition relation.

[Unhelpfulness means that they're less willing to listen to a lot of questions and assist you if you're a tourist. Privacy means they're less willing to answer questions about themselves or their personal beliefs. Courtesy means they're more likely to be apologetic, etc., when making dispreferred conversational choices. Caution means that they're likely to avoid situations leading to demands on themselves. Vanity means they're more likely to assume that you're hitting on them (in the ostensible motives line).]

Section 7 - Moods

Include Mood Variations by Emily Short.

The moods are neutral, distrustful, sexy, worried, sexy-worried, and sexy-distrustful. The current mood of a person is usually neutral.

 

Section 8 - Refusals for threaded actions

Rule for refusing to buy something when the location is the gift shop:
	if library message person is second person:
		say "You consider it briefly, but conclude there's nothing you really need.";
	otherwise:
		say "I just can't stand to buy anything here."

Rule for refusing to kiss a man:
	if library message person is second person:
		say "You run a series of possible ploys and distractions and minor cons through your mind and discard them all: too risky, too slow to perform, etc.";
	otherwise:
		say "[one of][The noun] [is-are] not my type[or]I'm really not attracted to [the noun], personally[or]Yet another man who does nothing for me[or]Unlike you, I don't make an attempt on everything that moves. And I still don't want to kiss random men [you] meet[stopping]."
	
Rule for refusing to kiss a woman:
	if library message person is second person:
		say "You run a series of possible ploys and distractions and minor cons through your mind and discard them all: too risky, too slow to perform, etc.";
	otherwise:
		say "Tempting, but no."

Rule for refusing to attack someone:
	if library message person is second person:
		say "You consider your strength and combat skill and decide that that might not be the most reliable approach.";
	otherwise if the player's command includes "kill" or the player's command includes "murder":
		say "[one of]What? No! Wow. What kind of person are you that that is even something that you think of trying? Nah, don't answer.[or][you][']ve covered that: it's no.[stopping]";
	otherwise:
		say "I don't solve my problems with violence. You can do what you like when we're separated again." instead.





Book 3 - Viewpoint and Narrative Voice

Include Locksmith by Emily Short. Include Plurality by Emily Short. Use sequential action. Use full-length room descriptions. 

Understand the command "latch" as "lock".

The passkey description rule is not listed in any rulebook.

After examining an identified passkey (this is the new passkey description rule):
	say "[The noun] unlocks [the list of things unbolted by the noun].";
	continue the action.
	
Test keybug with "tutorial off / x key / wear monocle / x key" holding the key and the monocle.

Section 1 - Overriding to First Plural

Include Custom Library Messages by David Fisher.

Include Tailored Room Description by Emily Short.

[This sets us up so that we can print object descriptions when taking items if the command was of the form TAKE FISH, but not if it was TAKE ALL and the result would be a screendump of different descriptions. See its use in the "report player taking" response below.]

To decide whether the action is singular:
	let L be the multiple object list;
	if the number of entries in L is less than 2:
		yes;
	no.
	
A thing can be examined or unexamined.

To say (item - a thing) description:
	say "[description of the item]";
	now the item is examined.
	
Carry out examining something:
	now the noun is examined.

Table of custom library messages (continued)

Don't take this the wrong way, but do you think your need for haptic feedback is a sign of nerve damage during our synthesis? No? Okay, just checking[cycling]".

Section 2 - Making TRD first plural

[ Tailored Room Description assumes a second-person narrator. We use TRD's abilities heavily throughout the game to control the order and manner in which items are described, but we need to do a couple of tweaks to get the output to conform properly to requirements here.]

When play begins:  
	now the current-topic-sentences-table is the Table of NBS;
	now the current-room-content-table is the Table of NRCD.

Rule for writing a topic sentence about an introduceable as-yet-unknown thing (called special-target)   which is not in the location:
	if the special-target is initially-described, make no decision;
	if the special-target is flexibly-described, make no decision;
	change the current-subject to special-target;
	let special-exterior be the holder of the special-target;
	if the special-exterior is a chair and the special-target is a person:
		make no decision; [this we want to describe explicitly as sitting]
	say "[You] can see [a special-target] [in-on special-exterior as a possibly-known item]. [run paragraph on]".

Table of NBS
disclosure 
"[if the current-subject is a person][The current-subject] [is-are] here. [otherwise][You] can see [a current-subject] here. [end if]".

Table of NRCD
disclosure 
"[You] can [optional also]see [a list of mentionable things in the current-subject] [if current-subject is the location]here[otherwise]in [the current-subject][end if]. ".

A ranking rule for a person (called special-target): 
	increase the description-rank of the special-target by 10.
	


Section 3 - Making Locksmith first plural

[Locksmith doesn't have a great deal of its own text, but we can add some.]

To say key-refusal for (key-object - the small door):
	say "It looks as though [you] need a keycard to unlock [the small door], and [you] don't have one."
	
Section 4 - Making Threaded Conversation first plural

[Threaded Conversation also refers to 'you' only in one place, which can be overridden by redefining a variable text: ]

When play begins:
	now quip-suggestion-phrase is "[one of][You] could [or]I'd like to [or][You] want to [or]I'm inclined to [or]My response would be to [as decreasingly likely outcomes]".
	
The no quip worth saying default rule is not listed in any rulebook.

Rule for expressing ignorance for the player (this is the new no-quip rule):
	say "[one of][You] can't think of anything appropriate to say[or]I'm not sure what you're trying to express, there[at random]."
	
Section 5 - Introductions

[Introductions are special text printed when we see a room or object for the first time, and are part of the dynamic description system which helps ground us in Alex's thoughts especially. ]

A thing has some text called the introduction. The introduction of a thing is usually "".
A room has some text called the introduction. The introduction of a room is usually "".

Rule for writing a paragraph about an as-yet-unknown introduceable thing (called special-target):
	carry out the writing a topic sentence about activity with the special-target;
	introduce the special-target;
	say paragraph break.
	
After examining an as-yet-unknown introduceable thing (called special-target):
	introduce the special-target;
	say paragraph break.
	
To introduce (special-target - an object):
	now the special-target is introduced;
	say "[introduction of the special-target]".

Definition: a thing is introduceable if its introduction is not "".

Definition: a room is introduceable if its introduction is not "".

A thing can be as-yet-unknown or introduced. A thing is usually as-yet-unknown.
A room can be as-yet-unknown or introduced. A room is usually as-yet-unknown.

The first time looking rule is listed after new object description rule in the carry out looking rules.

This is the first time looking rule: 
	if location is introduceable and the location is as-yet-unknown:
		introduce the location;
		say paragraph break.
	
A description-concealing rule:
	now every thing which is held by an as-yet-unknown introduceable person is not marked for listing. [This is so that preliminary descriptions of characters will not be followed by 'so and so is holding such and such and wearing so-and-that.']
	
Section 6 - The THINK verb

Understand "think about [any introduceable introduced thing]" or "remember [any introduceable introduced thing]" as thinking about. Understand the commands "recall" or "consider" or "recollect" or "ponder" or "contemplate" as "remember".

Thinking about is an action applying to one visible thing.

Carry out thinking about: 
	introduce the noun;
	say paragraph break.
	
Book 4 - Default World Model Tweaks


Part 1 - Parsing and Verb Handling

Section 1 - Smarter Parser

[These libraries by Aaron Reed are designed to make life a little easier on the novice player, and sometimes even on the advanced player, by looking for common errors when there's a parser failure, and by giving the player a greater range of control when disambiguating items with related names.]

Include Smarter Parser by Aaron Reed. 

Include Numbered Disambiguation Choices by Aaron Reed.

[Use empty Smarter Parser rulebook.]

To announce the reparsed command:
	say "[first custom style]([unless saved Smarter Parser error is empty][saved Smarter Parser error] Retrying that as '[reborn command]'.)[roman type][command clarification break]".
	
To explain the reborn command:
	say "[first custom style][saved Smarter Parser error][roman type][line break]". 
	
The unnecessary movement rule is not listed in any rulebook.
The too many words rule is not listed in any rulebook. [conversation commands can be quite long.]
 
[And we want to make sure that we're not listing tutorial prompts in the middle of command reparses:]

The offer new prompt rule is not listed in any rulebook.

Before reading a command when tutorial mode is true (this is the alternate new prompt rule):
	if sp reparse flag is false and identification is not happening:
		follow the instructional rules. 
		
The stripping failed with rule is not listed in any rulebook. [There are too many actions in the game where "with" IS fruitful, so this often gives a misleading response.]

[A smarter parser rule when sp_normal (this is the new stripping failed with rule):
	unless propping something with or attacking something with or blindfolding something with or selecting something with or shooting something with:
		if stripping "(with|using|by) (the|a|some|my)? ?\w*" is fruitful:
			identify error as stripping failed with rule;
			reparse the command. ] 
			
When play begins:
	choose row with SP rule of asking unparseable questions rule in the Table of Smarter Parser Messages;
	now the message entry is "If you're trying to converse with other characters, the suggestions in the text provide possible phrasings; so if you read 'I might ask about lentils.', you might phrase your command ASK ABOUT LENTILS. Introducing other words or variant phrasings that weren't part of the suggestion may confuse the game. 

Alternatively, if you just want to take an action in the game world, try giving a direct command, such as EXAMINE THE ASP or WAVE THE P-REMOVER AT THE PHONEY."
	 

	
Section 2 - Additional Parsing Lines for USE

[Wherever possible, we want USE THING to fall through to a plausible default behavior, which we do with a bunch of additional grammar lines:]

Understand "use [an edible thing]" as eating.

Understand "use [a wearable thing]" as wearing.

Understand "use [a closed openable container]" as opening. Understand "use [an open openable container]" as closing.

Understand "use [something preferably held] on [a locked lockable thing]" as unlocking it with (with nouns reversed). Understand "use [something preferably held] on [an unlocked lockable thing]" as locking it with (with nouns reversed).

Understand "use [a locked lockable thing]" as unlocking keylessly.
Understand "use [an unlocked lockable thing]" as locking keylessly.

Understand "use [a switched off device]" as switching on.

Understand "use [something]" as using. Using is an action applying to one thing. Carry out using: say "You will have to be more specific about your intentions."

Understand "use [paste] on/with [something]" as putting it on.

Understand "use [gel] on/with [something]" as putting it on.

Understand "use [tub] on/with [something]" as putting it on.

Understand "use [pistol] on [something ungunlike]" as shooting it with (with nouns reversed).

Understand "use [pistol] on [something]" as shooting it with (with nouns reversed).

Understand "use [a door]" as opening. Understand "use [an open door]" as entering. 

Understand "use [something] on/with [something]" as using it on. Using it on is an action applying to two things. Carry out using it on: say "I'm not sure what you mean; maybe you could pick a more specific verb." instead.

Section 3 - Miscellaneous Verbs

[And by a similar token, these create preferences in the parser so that the game will try the most obvious items first:]

Understand the commands "revive" or "resuscitate" as "wake".
	
Understand the command "kick" as "attack".

Understand the command "ransack" as "search". 

Understand the command "brush" as "clean".

Understand "brush off [something]" as rubbing.

Understand "eat [an edible thing]" as eating. Understand "wear [a wearable thing]" as wearing. Understand "open [something closed]" as opening. Understand "close [something open]" as closing. Understand "enter [something enterable]" as entering. Understand "enter [a door]" as entering. 

Understand the command "chew" as "eat". [to cover the gum situation]

Understand "climb on/onto [something]" as climbing.

[Before eating something which is not carried by the player: 
	try taking the noun; 
	if the player does not have the noun, stop the action. ]

Before wearing something which is not carried by the player: if the noun is worn, continue the action; try taking the noun; if the player does not have the noun, stop the action.
			
Understand "plugh" or "xyzzy" or "frotz" or "plover" as a mistake ("What [you] do isn't magic. It's science.").

Understand "vomit" or "throw up" or "puke" or "barf" as a mistake ("[You] may feel a bit ill, but I don't think that's necessary.").

Section 4 - Miscellaneous Class Vocabulary

Understand "man" or "gentleman" or "guy" or "dude" or "boy" as a man. Understand "girl" or "gal" or "woman" or "lady" as a woman.

Section 5 - Sanity and Accessibility

The sanity-check rules are a rulebook.

This is the sanity-check stage rule:
	abide by the sanity-check rules.

The sanity-check stage rule is listed before the before stage rule  in the action-processing rules.

To decide whether (item - a thing) must be touched: 
    if the item is the noun and the action requires a touchable noun, yes; 
    if the item is the second noun and the action requires a touchable second noun, yes; 
    no.
 
An accessibility rule (this is the no touching NPC stuff rule): 
	if the touch-goal is enclosed by someone (called the owner) who is not the actor and the touch-goal must be touched:
		if the person reaching is the player:
			say "I don't dare invade the personal space of [the owner].";
		rule fails;
	make no decision.
	
A first accessibility rule (this is the go to location rule):
	if the location of the touch-goal is not the location of the person reaching:
		let the target room be the location of the touch-goal;
		if the number of moves from the location to the target room is 1:
			try approaching target room;
			if the location is not target room:
				rule fails;
	make no decision.

To decide what object is the touch-goal:
	(- (untouchable_object) -).
	 
Sanity-check eating an inedible thing:
	say "[The noun] wouldn't agree with us even if [you] were feeling better." instead.
	
Sanity-check wearing something which is not wearable:

Part 2 - Senses 
	
Section 1 - Smell and Taste

A thing has some text called the scent-description.

The scent-description of a person is usually "deod[our]ant".

A thing has some text called the flavor-description.

Instead of tasting something:
	if the flavor-description of the noun is "":
		if the noun is r-abstract:
			say "There's not enough there to provide much flav[our]."; 
		else:
			say "[Cap It-they of noun] taste[s] as I would have expected."; 
	otherwise:
		say "[flavor-description of the noun].[paragraph break]".

Instead of smelling something:
	if the scent-description of the noun is "":
		if the noun is r-abstract:
			say "There's hardly any od[our] to [the noun]."; 
		else:
			say "[Cap It-they of noun] smell[s] as I would have expected.";
	otherwise:
		say "[Cap It-they of noun] smell[s] like [scent-description of the noun].[paragraph break]".
		
Instead of tasting something which is not edible:
	if the noun is a person:
		say "That would be unpleasantly intimate.";
	otherwise:
		say "[one of]I have an aversion to licking things that aren't meant for human consumption.[or]Doesn't that seem kind of germy?[or]Ew.[at random]".
	
Understand "bite [someone]" as attacking.

Understand "bite [something]" as tasting.

Instead of eating something:
	say "[one of]I don't think our nausea makes eating such a great idea.[or]I really couldn't.[or]I'm still feeling pretty sick to our stomach.[or]Let's not tempt fate.[cycling]"

Section 2 - Loudness

A thing can be noisy or quiet. A thing is usually quiet.

Every turn when the player is not in the car:
	if listening:
		make no decision;
	call the swift rule on everything in scope;
	let noisemaker be a random noisy marked for listing thing;
	now everything is not marked for listing;
	if the noisemaker is something and the noisemaker is not in a closed container:
		try listening to the noisemaker.
		
Report listening to a quiet thing:
	say "[The noun] [one of]do[es]n't make much noise[or][is-are] naturally silent[or]make[s] no notable noises[at random]." instead.
	
Report listening to a person:
	if the noun is the current interlocutor:
		say "I'm paying attention, don't worry." instead;
	otherwise:
		say "[You] hear some breathing, I guess. Nothing extraordinary." instead.

Part 3 - Travel and the Map

Chapter 1 - Moving Between Places

Section 1 - Listing Exits

Include Exit Lister by Gavin Lambert. 
 
Instead of going nowhere:
	carry out the listing exits activity.

Rule for listing exits when looking in a dead-end room:
	do nothing.
	
Definition: a room is dead-end if the number of exit-listable directions is 1.

The generate exit list rule is not listed in any rulebook.

The last for listing exits rule (this is the new generate exit list rule):
	let exits be the number of exit-listable directions;
	if exits is 0, say "[no obvious exits]";
	otherwise say "[You] can go [list of exit-listable directions] from here.".

Section 2 - Finding
	
Understand "find [any seen thing]" as finding. Understand the command "seek" or "approach" as find. Understand "look for [any seen thing]" as finding. Understand "go to [any seen thing]" as finding. 

Finding is an action applying to one visible thing. 

Check finding something that is in the repository:
	say "Who knows where [the noun] went?" instead.
	
Check finding something that is enclosed by the player:
	say "[You][']re carrying [the noun]." instead.

Check finding a backdrop:
	say "[The noun] [is-are]n't in one specific location." instead.
	
Check finding something that is enclosed by the location:
	say "[The noun] should be close by." instead;

Carry out finding:
	let place be the location of the noun;
	if place is not a room and the noun is a door:
		let place be the front side of the noun;
		if place is not visited:
			let place be the back side of the noun; 
	if place is a room and place is not the location:
		try approaching place;
	otherwise:
		say "I'm a little confused about how to find [the noun]."

Sanity-check finding a door which is in the location:
	try entering the noun instead.

Section 3 - Approaches and Describing Distance Travel 

Include Approaches by Emily Short. Use slow route-finding. 

A room can be nonsecret or forbidden. A room is usually nonsecret.

A room can be nonsouthern or southern. A room is usually nonsouthern.

["Southern" rooms are those you reach by walking east or south from the roundabout]

Carry out going to a forbidden room (called target):
	now the target is nonsecret.

Understand "go to [any nonsecret room]" or "goto [any nonsecret room]" or "go back to [any nonsecret room]" or "return to [any nonsecret room]" or "revisit [any nonsecret room]"  as approaching.  

The new approach refusal rule is listed instead of the refusing bad headings rule in the approach-finding rules.

This is the new approach refusal rule:
	if approach-heading is not a direction:
		say "Neither of us can think how to get there from here.";
		rule fails.
	
The new approach heading finding rule is listed instead of the approach-heading selection rule in the approach-finding rules.

This is the new approach heading finding rule:
	change approach-heading to the best route from the location to the noun, using doors;
	if approach-heading is not a direction:
		change approach-heading to the best route from the location to the noun, using even locked doors; 

Path description count is a number that varies. [let's count how many times we've invoked this activity this turn!]

Every turn:
	now path description count is 0.

Rule for describing path of the player:
	let N be the number of entries in the described motion of the player;
	if N is greater than 0:
		let C be indexed text;
		if path description count is greater than 0:
			let C be "[one of]Then[or]Next[or]From there[or]After that[as decreasingly likely outcomes] ";
		let C be "[C][one of][You] [or][You] have a [walk-length for N][or][You] make the [optional walk-length for N][or]It's a [walk-length for N][at random]"; 
		say "[C in sentence case]";
		say "[walk-drive]";
		if the intervening regions of the player is not empty:
			say "[through the intervening regions]";
		if the location is not the final destination:
			say " [one of]to[or]over to[or]as far as[at random] [the location]. [run paragraph on]";
		otherwise:
			say ". [run paragraph on]";
	increase path description count by 1;
	clear path-walked for player.
	
To say optional walk-length for (N - a number):
	if the player is in the car:
		let N be N divided by 2; [distances should be adjusted to mode of transport]
	if N is less than 5:
		say "[one of][one of]short[or]brief[or]quick[at random] [or][cycling]";
	otherwise if N is less than 8:
		say "[one of][one of]fair[or]healthy[at random] [or][cycling]";
	otherwise:
		say "[one of][one of]long[or]lengthy[or]rather tiring[at random] [or][cycling]"; 
	
To say walk-length for (N - a number):
	if the player is in the car:
		let N be N divided by 2; [distances should be adjusted to mode of transport]
	if N is less than 5:
		say "[one of]short[or]brief[or]quick[at random] ";
	otherwise if N is less than 8:
		say "[one of]fair[or]healthy[at random] ";
	otherwise:
		say "[one of]long[or]lengthy[or]rather tiring[at random] "; 
		
[The rather odd cycling guarantees that we don't repeat a word.]

To say walk-drive:
	if the player is enclosed by a vehicle:
		say "drive";
	otherwise:
		say "[one of]walk[or]hike[as decreasingly likely outcomes]".
	
To say through the intervening regions:
	repeat through the Table of Region Descriptions:
		if the intervening regions of the player is the intervening entry:
			say " [description entry]";

Table of Region Descriptions
intervening	description
{Marina}	"through the marina district"
{Walltop}	"along the top of the walls"
{Open-Air}	"[one of]pushing through the dense crowds[or]among the crowds[or]among the booths of the fair[at random]"
{Open-Air, Walltop}	"away from the crowds and the fair and over the top of the old walls"
{Open-Air, Walltop, Wealthy District}	"from the kitschy splend[our] of the fair along the old walls and into the placid sunlight among the villas of the rich"
{Walltop, Open-Air}	"back into the crowded area of the fair"
{Walltop, Wealthy District}	"down from the walls and through the wide peaceful streets where the rich live"
{Wealthy District, Walltop}	"through the residential streets and up onto the old wall"
{Wealthy District, Walltop, Open-Air}	"out of the cocooning silence of the wealthy streets and back among the fair booths"
{Marina, Busy Streets}	"[one of]through the heart of the city[or][--] only [i]almost[/i] dying at the roundabout when you didn't yield at the right moment [--][or]up the steep switchback of Deep Street[if the location is not the roundabout] and through the perilous traffic of the roundabout[end if][at random]"
{Marina, Busy Streets, Official Grounds}	"away from the smugglers['] territory by the docks, into the shadow of officialdom"
{Marina, Busy Streets, Campus}	"up through the shadowy corridor of Deep Street, around the roundabout, and then down the palm-lined avenue that is Long Street"
{Official Grounds, Busy Streets}	"away from the Bureau and back into the streets"
{Official Grounds, Busy Streets, Campus}	"out of the Bureau building, around the roundabout [--] always a menace to drivers and pedestrians alike [--] and down Long Street"
{Official Grounds, Busy Streets, Marina}	"out of the Bureau and down into the shadows of Deep Street"
{Campus, Busy Streets}	"out from under the sycamores in the Oval and up Long Street"
{Campus, Busy Streets, Marina}	"from my native territory through yours"
{Campus, Busy Streets, Official Grounds}	"[one of][--]the trip gets more uncomfortable as [you] go, leaving my own neighb[our]hood, fighting the inevitable snarl of traffic at the roundabout, and then heading down Tall Street, which always feels menacingly silent to me. But [you] do get[or]away from the familiar bustle of campus, up Long Street, around the roundabout, along Tall Street[stopping]"
		
A person has a list of regions called the intervening regions.

Carry out going while hurrying (this is the new creating a path history rule):
	if the map region of the location is a region:
		add the map region of the location to the intervening regions of the player, if absent.

To clear all/the/-- path-walked for (worker - yourself):
	truncate the intervening regions of the worker to 0 entries;
	truncate the described motion of the worker to 0 entries;
	truncate the path so far of the worker to 0 entries.

[Rule for describing path of the player:
	if the number of entries in the path so far of the player is greater than 0:
		if the location is not the noun:
			let N be the number of entries in the described motion of the player;
			let last movement be entry N in the described motion of the player;
			truncate the described motion of the player to (N - 1) entries;
			if N is 1:
				say "We [if the player is enclosed by a vehicle]drive[otherwise]go[end if]";
			otherwise:
				say "We [if the player is enclosed by a vehicle]drive[otherwise]go[end if] [described motion of the player]";
				if N is greater than 2:
					say ", before heading"; 
				otherwise:
					say ", then head";  
			say " [the last movement]. [run paragraph on]";
		otherwise:
			say "We go [described motion of the player]. [run paragraph on]"; 
	clear path-walked for player. ]
	

[There are some places that are inappropriate to enter at certain times. We want to block both going and approaching these rooms; otherwise the parser will might let us walk halfway there before blocking progress, which is unclassy.]

Sanity-check going to a room (called target):
	abide by the room-restriction rules for the target.
	
Sanity-check approaching a room (called target):
	abide by the room-restriction rules for the target.
	
The room-restriction rules are an object-based rulebook.
		
A room-restriction rule for a southern room:
	if the Counterfeit Monkey is unvisited:
		say "Don't [you] have an appointment at the Counterfeit Monkey? [You] should be heading northeast up Deep Street.";
		rule fails; 
	if Slango is not seen and Counterfeit Monkey is visited:
		say "That would take us more towards my part of the world, not help us find Slango.";
		rule fails.	
		
A room-restriction rule for Tall Street when Counterfeit Monkey is unvisited:
	say "Don't [you] have an appointment at the Counterfeit Monkey? [You] should be heading northeast up Deep Street.";
	rule fails; 
	
A room-restriction rule for Wonderland when Brock-argument has not happened:
	say "Best to start looking for Brock where we know he went: the equipment testing room.";
	rule fails.
	
A room-restriction rule for Cold Storage when Brock-argument has not happened:
	say "Best to start looking for Brock where we know he went: the equipment testing room.";
	rule fails.

[A room-restriction rule for the Customs House:
	say "Isn't our purpose exactly to avoid the attention of immigration officials, customs officers, and the like?";
	rule fails. ]
		
After going a direction for the third turn:
	if the location is visited:
		say "[first custom style][bracket]If you're traveling far, you can always type GO TO (location name) to get there automatically.[close bracket][roman type][paragraph break]";
	continue the action.
	
Section 4 - Going Back and Going Vaguely
 
Understand "go back" as retreating. Understand "back" or "return" or "retreat" as retreating.

The former direction is a direction that varies.

Carry out going: change the former direction to the noun.

Retreating is an action applying to nothing. 

Carry out retreating:
	let new direction be the opposite of the former direction;
	say "(heading [new direction])[line break]";
	try going the new direction.
	
Understand "leave [any room]" or "go outside [any room]" as departing. Departing is an action applying to one thing.

Check departing: if the noun is not the location, say "You aren't in [the noun]." instead.

Carry out departing:
	let chosen way be the logical exit;
	if chosen way is a direction
	begin;
		say "(heading [chosen way], since that is the only direction available)[line break]";
		try going chosen way;
	otherwise;
		 say "Any particular direction? ";
		carry out the listing exits activity;
	end if. 
	
To decide what direction is the logical exit:
	let N be 0;
	let chosen way be north;
	repeat with way running through directions
	begin; 
		let place be the room way from the location; 
		if place is a room
		begin;
			increase N by 1;
			let chosen way be the way;
		end if;
	end repeat;
	if N is 1, decide on the chosen way.
	
Chapter 2 - Looking Towards Other Areas

Section 1 - Far Away Things and Facades

Include Far away by Jon Ingold.

Instead of throwing something at something far-off:
	say "Our aim isn't nearly good enough."

A facade is a kind of thing. A facade is usually fixed in place. A facade has some text called the closure notice. The closure notice of a facade is usually "[The item described] [is-are] [one of]closed[or]shut[or]not open[or]locked up[purely at random] [one of]for[or]during[or]on[purely at random] [one of]the holiday[or]Serial Comma Day[purely at random]. ".

Instead of pushing or pulling or turning or taking a facade, say "[You] aren't super-powered."
Instead of looking under a facade, say "[The noun] will not just peel back like a stage curtain, you know.".
Instead of searching a facade, say "[You] would have to go to [a random direction fronted by the noun] in order to see what is there."

Fronting relates various facades to one direction. The verb to front (it fronts, they front, it fronted, it is fronted) implies the fronting relation.

Before an actor entering a facade:
	let chosen way be a random direction which is fronted by the noun; 
	try the actor going the chosen way instead.
	
Instead of going nowhere when the noun is fronted by a facade (called blockage) in the location:
	say "[closure notice of the blockage][run paragraph on]";
	carry out the listing exits activity.
	
Instead of going nowhere when the noun is not fronted by a facade in the location:
	try facing the noun;
	carry out the listing exits activity.
	
A down-staircase is a kind of facade. Understand "step" or "steps" or "stairs" or "stairwell" or "staircase" as a down-staircase. A down-staircase is usually scenery.

An up-staircase is a kind of facade. Understand "step" or "steps" or "stairs" or "stairwell" or "staircase" as an up-staircase. An up-staircase is usually scenery.

Instead of climbing an up-staircase, try going up.
Instead of climbing a down-staircase, try going down.

When play begins:
	now every down-staircase fronts down;
	now every up-staircase fronts up.
	
Section 2 - LOOK AT LOCATION as LOOK

Definition: a room is locally-present if it is the location.

Understand "here" or "surroundings" as a room when the item described is the location.

Understand "examine [any locally-present room]" or "look at [any locally-present room]" or "look [any locally-present room]" as local looking. Understand "look around" as looking.

Local looking is an action applying to one thing.

Carry out local looking:
	try looking.

Section 3 - Facing

Include Facing by Emily Short.

Instead of examining a direction:
	try facing the noun.

Rule for distantly describing a proper-named room (called target) (this is the new distant description rule):
	say "[You] make out [the target] that way."
	
The default distant description rule is not listed in any rulebook.

Rule for distantly describing a room (called target):
	let N be indexed text;
	let N be "[the target]";
	say "[You] can make out [N in lower case] that way."
	
Rule for distantly describing a room (called target) which encloses someone when the location is indoors:
	let N be indexed text;
	let N be "[the target]";
	say "That way [you] can see [unless the target is proper-named][N in lower case][otherwise][the target][end if], in which [is-are a list of people enclosed by the target]."
	
When play begins:
	change nothing-to-see-that-way to "[You] can't see anything interesting in that direction."
	
Screening relates various backdrops to various directions. The verb to screen (it screens, they screen, it screened, it is screened) implies the screening relation.
			
Check facing when the location contains a backdrop:
	repeat with the item running through backdrops in the location:
		if the item screens the noun:
			if the noun is not up and the noun is not down:
				say "To the [noun] [is-are of the item] [an item]. [run paragraph on]";
			try examining the item instead. [We want to be able to fill in what's that way.]
			
Check facing when the location contains a facade:
	repeat with item running through facades in the location:
		if the item fronts the noun:
			if the noun is not up and the noun is not down:
				say "To the [noun] [is-are of the item] [an item]. [run paragraph on]";
			try examining the item instead. [We want to be able to fill in what's that way.]
			
A direction has a direction called left-alt. A direction has a direction called right-alt.

The left-alt of north is northwest. The right-alt of north is northeast.
The left-alt of northwest is west. The right-alt of northwest is north.
The left-alt of west is southwest. The right-alt of west is northwest.
The left-alt of southwest is south. The right-alt of southwest is west.
The left-alt of south is southeast. The right-alt of south is southwest.
The left-alt of southeast is east. The right-alt of southeast is south.
The left-alt of east is northeast. The right-alt of east is southeast.
The left-alt of northeast is north. The right-alt of northeast is east. 
 
To say is-are of (item - a room):
	say "is"

Last check facing:
	if the noun is up or the noun is down: 
		make no decision;
	let leftway be left-alt of the noun;
	let rightway be right-alt of the noun; 
	let leftward thing be the thing seen facing leftway;
	let rightward thing be the thing seen facing rightway;
	if leftward thing is nothing and rightward thing is nothing:
		make no decision;
	if leftward thing is nothing:
		say "There is nothing of note to [the leftway], but to [the rightway] [is-are of rightward thing] [the rightward thing]." instead;
	if rightward thing is nothing:
		say "There is nothing of note to [the rightway], but to [the leftway] [is-are of leftward thing] [the leftward thing]." instead;
	if the location is indoors:
		say "That way is just a corner of the room, though [you] could go [leftway] to [the leftward thing] or [rightway] to [the rightward thing]." instead;
	otherwise if leftward thing is a road and rightward thing is a road:
		say "That way is the corner of [the leftward thing] and [the rightward thing]." instead;
	otherwise if leftward thing is a facade and rightward thing is a facade:
		say "In that direction [one of][the leftward thing] abut[s] [the rightward thing], and there's no good way between them[or][the leftward thing] meet[s] the edge of [the rightward thing][or]lies the corner between [the leftward thing] and [the rightward thing][at random]." instead; 
	otherwise if leftward thing is a road:
		say "That way is the corner of [the rightward thing] and the beginning of [leftward thing] running [leftway]." instead;
	otherwise if rightward thing is a road:
		say "That way is the corner of [the leftward thing] and the beginning of [rightward thing] running [rightway]." instead;
	otherwise:
		say "To [the noun] [the leftward thing] meet[s] [the rightward thing]." instead.

To decide what object is the thing seen facing (dir - a direction):
	if a backdrop (called target) in the location screens dir:
		decide on the target;
	otherwise if a facade (called second target) in the location fronts dir:
		decide on the second target;
	otherwise if the door dir of the location is a door:
		decide on the door dir of the location;
	otherwise if the room dir of the location is a room:
		decide on the room dir of the location.
			

Understand "look behind [something]" or "search behind/under [something]" as looking under.

A room can be indoors or outdoors. A room is usually outdoors.

Report facing when the location is indoors:
	if the viewed location is not a room:
		if the noun is up or the noun is down:
			say "There's nothing remarkable [noun] there." instead;
		say "There's no door in that direction." instead.

The sky is a distant backdrop. It screens up. The sun is part of the sky. The description of the sky is "[sky-description]". The description of the sun is "[sun-description]".
	
When play begins:
	move the sky backdrop to all outdoors rooms.
	



Chapter 3 - Vehicles and Transport Animals

Section 1 - Animals

Include Rideable Vehicles by Graham Nelson.

[In addition to providing a bunch of generic synonyms in a hurry, these kinds allow us to design in some specialized behavior for how animals act when moving and so on. There are a huge number of creatable animals in the game, so it's best to categorize as much as possible.]

A bird is a kind of animal. Understand "wing" or "wings" or "bird" or "feather" or "feathers" as a bird.

An insect is a kind of animal. Understand "bug" or "insect" as an insect.

Sanity-check touching or rubbing or squeezing an insect:
	say "[You][']d rather not. All those legs." instead.


The scent-description of an animal is usually "sweaty animal".
The scent-description of a bird is "fresh air".
The scent-description of an insect is "summer heat".



Section 2 - Roads 

A road is a kind of room. Definition: a room is offroad if it is not a road.

Instead of going from a road to a road:
	if the player is in the car:
		continue the action;
	if a car (called target) is visible:
		if more than one car is visible:
			now the target is a random visible fueled car; [there will only ever be enough fuel for one car]
		try entering the target;
		if the player is in the target:
			try going the noun instead;
	if the protesters are visible:				
		if the number of entries in the path so far of the player is greater than 0:
			say "[path-walked so far][paragraph break]";
		say "Unfortunately the sidewalks, which were never very wide to start with, are so blocked by the mass of protesters that it's impossible to get by. Besides, if we associate with them, we might wind up getting arrested on minor charges anyway. We need some kind of automotive transport.";
		assign "Find transport for getting past the traffic on High Street" at High Street;  
	otherwise if the room gone to is the Roundabout and the protesters are not off-stage:
		say "That whole area is so jammed that our only hope is to go by car.";
	otherwise:
		continue the action.

Section 3 - Cars

[The aim of the car code is to create a car that 

-- navigates roads the player otherwise wouldn't be able to cross
-- responds sensibly to a wide range of commands, both standard GO commands and commands about driving
-- performs as transparently as possible after initial use, automating everything to do with opening, entering, turning on, driving, turning off, exiting, and closing the car so that the player is not conscious of these steps. 

Once acquired and repaired, the car should become as nearly transparent as walking across those areas on foot, except that it provides some additional boundaries when in the Roundabout area, where the player can't get out except under special circumstances.

Because any vanilla chair can be converted to a car, there are multiple cars; in practice, the player is unlikely to create more than one, and the first available one must always come from the chard.]
	
Understand "start [something]" as switching on.

Understand "drive [a direction]" as going when the player is in a vehicle.

Understand "drive [car] [a direction]" as car-driving when the player is in the car. Car-driving is an action applying to one thing and one visible thing. Carry out car-driving: try going the second noun.

Understand "drive to [any nonsecret room]" as approaching.

Understand "drive [car] to [any nonsecret room]" as car-approaching. Car-approaching is an action applying to one thing and one visible thing. Carry out car-approaching: try approaching the second noun.

Understand "honk" or "honk at [text]" as a mistake ("[if the player is not in the car]We aren't a goose[otherwise if the protesters are visible]One of the protesters turns and waves, taking this as a gesture of support[otherwise]We receive an insulting gesture from the person in the car ahead[end if].").

Understand "protest" or "join protest" or "picket" as a mistake ("If I thought you could change Atlantis that way, I'd be on board. But I've given up on social action long since.").

A car is a kind of vehicle. A car is usually transparent. The heft of a car is 7. The flexible appearance of a car is "Our car[one of] [--] a sub-sub-compact that looks like it might be outraced by a kid on a scooter [--][or] [--] which might better be described as a covered bicycle [--][or][at random] is parked [if the location is offroad]illegally [end if]nearby." 
	The description of a car is "It is little larger than a toy, but that is what you want when driving on the streets around here. Any substantial vehicle wouldn't fit down the winding drives." 
	The introduction is "Here is how my mother gets around. She takes a 300 Euro Hermès scarf with an orange border and a pattern of prancing horses. She tosses it in the air. As it falls, she shoots it twice, like a clay pigeon: once to take out the F, the second time for the S. And such a car: buttery leather seats, jaguar lines. If someone asks how she gets such good results, she jokes that it's because of her quality materials.

Suffice it to say that we are not similarly blessed."
	Understand "toy" or "sub-subcompact" as a car.
	The scent-description of a car is "metal parts and oil".

A car can be fueled or unfueled. A car is usually unfueled.

Definition: a thing is fuel-like if it is the fuel or it is the gas.

Sanity-check inserting a fuel-like thing into a car:
	try fueling the second noun with the noun instead.

	
Understand "fuel [something] with [something preferably held]" as fueling it with. Understand "fuel [something]" as fueling it with. Fueling it with is an action applying to one thing and one carried thing.

Rule for supplying a missing second noun while fueling something with:
	if the player can see the fuel:
		now the second noun is the fuel;
	otherwise if the player can see the gas:
		now the second noun is the gas;
	otherwise:
		say "[You] don't have any plausible fuel to hand."

Check fueling something with a vegetable:
	say "I've heard of biodiesel, but that carries the point too far." instead.

Check fueling something with something which is not fuel-like:
	say "[The second noun] do[es]n't make much of a fuel." instead.

Check fueling something which is not a car with something:
	say "[The noun] [one of]do[es]n't take fuel[or][is-are]n't fuel-powered[at random]." instead.
	
Carry out fueling something with something:
	remove the second noun from play;
	now the noun is fueled;
	complete "Fuel the car";
	record "fueling our car" as achieved;
	say "I deeply fear automotive maintenance, but I can (just) manage to pour in the fuel... and I think that's done it." instead.

Rule for printing the name of a car while opening or closing the car:
	say "car door".

Understand "fix [something]" or "mend [something]" or "tune [something]" or "tune up [something]" or "tune [something] up" or "repair [something]" as tuning. Tuning is an action applying to one thing.

Sanity-check tuning something which is not a car:
	if the noun is an instrument:
		say "Tuning [the noun] would have to be left to an expert; I have no idea how." instead;
	if the noun is a person:
		say "Psychiatry is not my field of expertise." instead;
	say "I am not quite sure what you have in mind, there." instead.

Check tuning:
	if the noun is not damaged:
		say "The car has already been repaired and is now in working order." instead;
	otherwise:
		say "I'm not good at this sort of thing. I mostly leave repairs to the garage." instead.

Instead of inserting oil into a car:
	say "In my limited interactions with motor vehicles, I've always taken the machine to a garage for any corrective work. This includes topping up the oil."

Report opening a car:
	say "[one of][You] open the car door: perhaps unsurprisingly, it comes without an effective lock system.[or][You] swing the car door open.[or][You] open the door of the car.[stopping]" instead.

A description-concealing rule:
	now every thing which encloses the player is not marked for listing.

Understand "park" as exiting when the player is in a car. Understand "park [car]" as car-parking when the player is in a car. Car-parking is an action applying to one thing. Carry out car-parking: try exiting instead.

A car is usually openable. A car is usually closed. 

Check entering a closed container (this is the attempt opening on enter rule):
	try opening the noun;
	if the noun is closed, stop the action.
	
Check exiting when the player is in a closed container (called the current-container) (this is the attempt opening on exit rule):
	try opening the current-container;
	if the current-container is closed, stop the action.
	
Check exiting when the player is in a noisy car:
	try switching off a random ignition which is incorporated by a car which contains the player;

Check going somewhere by a car which is not noisy:
	try switching on a random ignition (called target) which is incorporated by a car which contains the player; 
	if the target is switched off, stop the action.

Check going somewhere by an open car (called target):
	try closing the target;
	if the target is open, stop the action.

Rule for describing the interior of a car:
	say "[You] [are] jammed into the car with our knees almost at our chin, looking out through the bulbous little [if the player wears the Britishizing goggles]windscreen[otherwise]windshield[end if][if the ignition is switched on]. The motor is growling like a housecat with pneumonia[end if]."
	 
The ignition is a kind of device. One ignition is part of every car. Understand "motor" as the ignition. Instead of listening to the ignition, try listening to a random car which incorporates the noun.

The gas-gauge is a kind of thing. One gas-gauge is part of every car. The description is "[if the car is fueled]It points over at the right, which must be Full[otherwise]It points all the way around at the left, or Empty[end if]." THe printed name of the gas-gauge is "gas gauge". Understand "gauge" or "gas gauge" as the gas-gauge.

Check switching on an ignition which is part of an unfueled car:
	say "There's no gas in the car; without fuel, it's not going far." instead.

Check switching on an ignition which is part of a damaged car:
	say "Though the engine does briefly turn on, there's clearly something wrong with it, from the unpleasant noises and the flashing lights on the dash. Perhaps it needs oil." instead.

Report switching on an ignition for the first time:
	say "We switch on the ignition and the car comes to life. Smelly, trembling, putt-putting life, but still, not bad for something we conjured out of a vegetable picked outside my parents['] place." instead.

[Instead of going by the car when the ignition is switched off: say "The ignition is off at the moment." ]

Carry out going somewhere by car:
	complete "Find transport for getting past the traffic on High Street";
	record "traveling by car" as achieved.

The car can be operational or damaged. A car is usually damaged.

Instead of going by unfueled car:
	assign "Fuel the car" at High Street;
	say "The extremely primitive dial in front of us is pointing all the way to the left. I think that's its way of saying it's out of fuel. At any rate, the engine won't start."

Instead of going by damaged car:  
	say "The car refuses to run properly: evidently you got us a lemon. It's going to take some tuning up before it will go."

Sanity-check switching on a car:
	 try switching on a random ignition which is part of the noun instead. 
	
Sanity-check switching off a car:
	try switching off a random ignition which is part of the noun. 

Carry out switching on the ignition:
	now a random car which incorporates the noun is noisy.
	
Carry out switching off the ignition:
	now a random car which incorporates the noun is quiet.
	
Instead of listening to a noisy car:
	say "The car is making an unpleasant raspy growl."

Instead of going by car (called used car) to somewhere offroad:
	if the player is hurrying:
		if the car is noisy:
			say "[one of][path-walked so far]Then[or][path-walked so far]There[or]Once [you] get to [location][or]At [location][at random] [you] [find a parking spot].[paragraph break]";
		otherwise:
			say "[path-walked so far]";
		clear path-walked for player;
		increase path description count by 1;
	otherwise if the car is noisy:
		say "Since there's no way by road, we'll have to leave [the used car] here. It is a moment's work to find a parking spot. [run paragraph on]";
	otherwise:
		say "That involves some off-road travel. We'll have to leave [the used car] here and walk. [run paragraph on]";
	try exiting;
	if the player is in a car,
		stop the action;
	otherwise try going the noun.
	
Report exiting when the container exited from is a car:
	say "We climb out of the car." instead.
	
To say find a parking spot: 
	if the current daytime is:
		-- noon: 
			say "struggle to find a parking spot";
		-- early afternoon: 
			say "[one of]drive around a bit trying to get a parking spot[or]try to nab several parking spots before finally managing to be more assertive than the other drivers[or]try unsuccessfully to fit into a spot even smaller than the car, before lucking into a freshly-vacated place[at random]";
		-- mid afternoon:
			say "[one of]find a place to park without too much trouble[or]park deftly in the shadow of a much larger vehicle[or]have a bit of a chore finding a parking spot[at random]";
		-- late afternoon:
			say "pull easily into one of the available parking spots, since many people have now gone home";
		-- sunset:
			say "park in the most convenient spot";
		-- evening:
			say "park" [shouldn't happen because it shouldn't be evening while we're still in driving mode. But we'll see.]

Instead of going by car when the location is offroad:
	say "This isn't exactly an area in which driving is encouraged. In fact, I'm not sure [you] can get the car anywhere."

		 

[Include Conditional Backdrops by John Clemens.]

When play begins:
	move protesters backdrop to all roads in Busy Streets;
	move traffic backdrop to all roads in Busy Streets; 

Some protesters are a backdrop. Understand "student" or "students" as the protesters. The description is "Hundreds of people pack the sidewalk, wearing slogans and carrying angry signs." 

A description-concealing rule when the location is High Street:
	now everything which is enclosed by the protesters is not marked for listing.

Instead of examining the hundreds of people: try examining the protesters.

Some hundreds of people are a person. They are part of the protesters. They wear slogans. They carry angry signs. 

The description of the angry signs is "They say things like 'No Referendum = No Responsibility,' 'NOT GUILTY,' and, more daringly, 'The citizens of Atlantis have never voted for human rights violations.' Some are just photos of Bureau officials wearing Hitler mustaches.

The protesters can't say this directly, of course, but what they are protesting is the use of inanimation as a punishment by the Bureau of Orthography. Making someone into an inanimate object, or enclosing him in an inanimate object, is not technically murder, but it is considered a massive human rights violation by just about every other country in the world."

The description of the slogans is "On every shirt and coat, sometimes screen-printed, sometimes just written on with a Sharpie, is the same message: NOT GUILTY.

You know better than I do how the international media looks at Atlantis. How it presents us as a fat, wealthy plutocracy whose citizens happily engage in atrocities in order to keep hold of our unique advantages. But on most of those human rights issues, it's not as though we were ever asked. We never voted to do those things. The Bureau simply enacted them as 'non-referrable procedures.'"

Instead of listening to the protesters:
	say "'Referendum Now!' they're shouting. And 'Not guilty.'"
	
Instead of listening to the location in the presence of the protesters:
	say "There are standard traffic noises and then the protesters. [no line break]";
	try listening to the protesters.

The traffic is a backdrop. It is distant. The indefinite article is "some". Understand "cars" or "vehicles" or "tail-lights" or "lights" or "drivers" or "congestion" as the traffic. The description of the traffic is "Nearly bumper-to-bumper despite the tiny size of the individual vehicles[one of]. In fact, I've never understood why people drive here at all: the city is almost small enough to make do with pedestrian routes and bicycles[or][stopping].". 

Instead of entering traffic:
	say "No one in these vehicles is likely to want to drive us anywhere."

[The scaffolding is a backdrop. Understand "construction" or "scaffold" as the scaffolding. The description is "Lately they've been doing a lot of construction and reconstruction around the center of town. They say it's renovation of dangerous old buildings. There are also other theories."

Instead of climbing the scaffolding:
	say "I wasn't a construction worker in previous life, and I'm pretty sure you weren't either." ]

Understand "cross [traffic]" or "ignore [traffic]" as a mistake ("You may have the nerve, but I don't.") when the player can see the traffic.

Test car-behavior with "tutorial off / car-acquire / cross traffic / ignore traffic / drive to roundabout / park / get out of car / go to deep street / nw / e / climb masses / look through window / out / out / se / get in car / drive to tall street / go to roundabout / drive to monkey" in high street.

Test roundaboutation with "tutorial off / car-acquire / drive to roundabout / z / z / z" in high street.

Section 4 - The View From Inside

[This lets us add a special line to descriptions when we're inside the car.]

The container interior rule is listed before the room description body text rule in the carry out looking rules.

This is the container interior rule: 
    if the actor is the player and the player is in an enterable thing (called current cage), carry out the describing the interior activity with the current cage.

Describing the interior of something is an activity.


	
Chapter 4 - Special Doors and Barriers

Section 1 - Door Descriptions and Knocking

The description of a door is usually "[if open][The item described] stand[s] open[otherwise if locked]Closed and locked[otherwise][Cap it-they of the item described] [is-are] closed[end if]."

Understand "knock on [door]" as knocking on. Knocking on is an action applying to one thing. Understand "knock on [something]" as attacking. 

Check knocking on an open door:
	say "It's open: [you] could just go in." instead.
	
Check knocking on a door:
	let far side be the other side of the noun;
	if the far side does not enclose someone:
		say "No one answers. It must be empty." instead.
		
Report knocking on a door:
	if the noun is unlocked:
		say "'It's unlocked,' says a voice from inside.";
	otherwise:
		say "No one answers."
		
Section 2 - Propping Doors

Wedging relates one thing to one door. The verb to wedge (it wedges, they wedge, it wedged, it is wedged) implies the wedging relation.

Propping it with is an action applying to one thing and one carried thing.

Understand "prop [something] with [something preferably held]" or "prop up/open [something] with [something preferably held]" or "prop [something] up/open with [something preferably held]" as propping it with. Understand the commands "wedge" or "jam" or "block" or "support" as "prop".  

Understand "put [something long] in/into/under/beneath [a door]" or "insert [something long] in/into/under/beneath [a door]" or "prop [something long] in/into/under/beneath [a door]" as propping it with (with nouns reversed).


Check propping something which is not a door with something:
	say "Propping is something best done to doors." instead.
	
Definition: a thing is bendy:
	if it is strong:
		no;
	if it is long:
		yes;
	no.

Check propping something with a bendy thing:
	say "[The second noun] [is-are] long enough, but too flexible to provide much support against the springs of [the noun]." instead.
	
Check propping something with something which is not long:
	say "[The second noun] [is-are] not long enough to prop [the noun] very effectively";
	if the second noun is strong:
		say ", though at least [it-they of second noun] [is-are] fairly stout." instead;
	else:
		say ", and even if [it-they of second noun] were, [it-they of second noun] wouldn't hold up against the pressure of the springs." instead.
	
Check propping something which is wedged by something (called the existing impediment) with something:
	say "[The noun] [is-are] already propped open by [the existing impediment]." instead.
	
Carry out propping a door with something:
	now the noun is open;
	move the second noun to the location;
	now the second noun wedges the noun;	

Report propping a door with something:
	say "[You] prop [the noun] open with [the second noun]."
	
Carry out taking something which wedges something:
	now the noun does not wedge anything.
	
A dangerous destruction rule for something which wedges something (called item):
	now the item is not wedged by anything.
	
Test propping with "open tub / d / u / open door / prop door with twig / prop door with wig / prop door with plans / prop door with fish / look / prop door with stick / d / u / wave t-remover at stick / gel sick / prop door with stick / d / wave t-remover at stick" holding the tub and the stick and the twig and the wig and the secret-plans in the tin hut.
	
Section 3 - Approaching doors (like the security door)

Understand "approach [a door]" as entering.
	
Chapter 5 - Special Kinds of Rooms

Section 1 - Essentials and Non-Drop Zones

[For the player's protection, there are certain rooms where we want him not to leave any objects, because those rooms will become unavailable and he'll be unable to retrieve anything he left there. So we create the concept of the privately-controlled rooms for rooms where it is unsafe to leave anything behind.]
	

A thing can be essential. A thing is usually not essential.

Definition: a thing is unleavable:
	if it is not essential, no;
	if it is not seen, no;
	if it is the origin paste and it is unwon, no;
	if it is the tube and it is carried by the barker, no; [we still have to win it]
	if it is enclosed by the player, no;
	if it is enclosed by a vehicle which contains the player, no;
	yes.

Before going when [the player is staid and] the location encloses an unleavable thing:
	while the location encloses an unleavable thing  (called needed-thing):
		try taking the needed-thing;
		if the needed-thing is the iron-pans:
			reduce iron-pans;
			if the i-pan is visible:
				now the needed-thing is the i-pan;
		if the player does not carry the needed-thing:
			say "I don't think [you] should leave without [the needed-thing].";
			stop the action. 
	 

A room can be publicly-available or privately-controlled. A room is usually publicly-available.
	
Sanity-check dropping something which is not heavy in a privately-controlled room (this is the no-dropping rule):
	say "[non-drop-zone]" instead.
	
Sanity-check inserting something into something which is not enclosed by the player in  a privately-controlled room:
	say "[non-drop-zone]" instead.
	
Sanity-check putting something on something which is not enclosed by the player in a privately-controlled room:
	if the noun is the gel:
		continue the action;
	if the noun is the origin paste:
		continue the action;
	say "[non-drop-zone]" instead.   
	
To say non-drop-zone:
	say "[one of]I wouldn't. [You] might never get [the noun] back.[or]I'm inclined to keep all our things with us, under the circumstances.[or]I'm not ready to part with [the noun] here. After all, can [you] be sure [you][']d be able to get back?[at random]".
	
Sanity-check putting gel on something which is proffered by a heavy thing (called resultant) when the location is a privately-controlled room:
	say "It might be difficult to do that here without attracting notice." instead.
	
Check waving the letter-remover at something when the location is a privately-controlled room:
	if the location is Aquarium Bookstore or the location is Traffic Circle:
		make no decision;
	otherwise:
		say "It might be difficult to do that here without attracting notice." instead.
		
Sanity-check going a direction when the player carries a heavy thing (called the target):
	say "[You] can't really travel far with [the target] in our arms.";
	if the target is iron-pans:
		reduce the iron-pans;
	if the player carries the target:
		stop the action. 
		
Sanity-check approaching a room when the player carries a heavy thing (called the target):
	say "[You] can't really travel far with [the target] in our arms.";
	if the target is iron-pans:
		reduce the iron-pans;
	if the player carries the target:
		stop the action. 
	
To reduce the/-- iron-pans: 
	let N be indexed text;
	change N to "s";
	change the current setting of the letter-remover to "[N]";
	say "In the interest of compactness, [you] S-remove the pans. [run paragraph on]";
	try waving the letter-remover at the iron-pans. 
	
Section 2 - Kitchens and Bathrooms

[There are quite a few of these location types, so we'll implement them consistently throughout the game using assemblies.]

Include Modern Conveniences by Emily Short.

Include Postures by Emily Short. 

Check going to a room when the player is not in the location:
	while the player is not in the location:
		let context be the holder of the player; 
		if context is a vehicle:
			continue the action;
		try exiting;
		if context is the holder of the player:
			stop the action instead;

A toilet is usually seated.

When play begins:
	now every toilet allows seated;
	now every toilet allows standing. 

Understand "wash hands" or "wash up" as a mistake ("[if a sink is in the location][You] briskly wash up[otherwise]There's no sink here[end if].").

Sanity-check washing a person who is not the player:
	if the noun is an animal:
		say "[The noun] could probably use a wash, but on the whole I don't see the point." instead;
	say "Bathing people other than myself is kind of over-intimate." instead.

A public restroom is a kind of room. 

A toilet-stall is a kind of container. The printed name of a toilet-stall is always "toilet stall". Rule for printing the plural name of a toilet-stall: say "toilet stalls". Understand "stall" as a toilet-stall. Understand "stalls" as the plural of a toilet-stall. A toilet-stall is always fixed in place and enterable and openable.

The description of a toilet-stall is usually "It is the usual beige metal dividers, the usual topical graffiti."

Some graffiti is a kind of thing. It is usually scenery.

Some graffiti is in every toilet-stall.
The description of graffiti is usually "[You] glance over the range of messages from past occupants and notice...[paragraph break][one of]Some wag has drawn an arrow pointing to the toilet and written beside it: P-REMOVER[or][i]There was a young lady from France[line break]Who was wearing a plain pair of pants[line break][']Til a linguistical gent[line break]With indecent intent[line break]Left the girl crawling with ants[/i][at random].".

A toilet-stall is always lit. A toilet-stall is usually scenery. Understand "toilet stall" as a toilet-stall. Rule for printing the name of a toilet-stall when the player is in the toilet-stall and the toilet-stall is closed: say "Toilet Stall". 

One toilet is in every toilet-stall.

Two toilet-stalls are in every public restroom. Two sinks are in every public restroom. 

Instead of tasting a toilet:
	say "Not while I'm sharing your tongue, thanks."
	
Instead of tasting a sink:
	say "Let's cling to a higher standard of hygiene, shall we?"

A mirror is a kind of thing. A mirror is in every bathroom. A mirror is in every public restroom. A mirror is usually scenery. Understand "glass" or "reflection" as a mirror.

The description of a mirror is "It's gleaming and shiny and very clean and I don't want to look in it."

Instead of searching a mirror when the player wears a wig and the player wears the monocle:
	say "The wig and the monocle together suggest some sort of steampunk fancy dress party."

Instead of searching a mirror when the player wears a wig:
	say "The wig looks surprisingly natural[if the pass is seen], and [you] resemble the image on the pass much better than [you] do without[end if]."
	
Instead of searching a mirror when the player wears a hairpiece and the player wears the monocle:
	say "The hairpiece/monocle combination makes us look like some sort of funky steampunk engineer, which might not be the most inconspicuous way to go."

Instead of searching a mirror when the player wears a hairpiece:
	say "The hairpiece looks surprisingly natural[if the pass is seen], and [you] resemble the image on the pass much better than [you] do without[end if]."

Instead of searching a mirror when the player wears a monocle:
	say "The monocle makes our right eye look deep green, and it has a sinister quality as well."
	
Instead of searching a mirror:
	say "I have not gotten used to what we look like since we were synthes[ize]d into a single female body. The face that looks back is deeply scary. It's not me. And it's not you either. It's more like one of those computer composites you can have done to envision future offspring: if you and I were to have a somewhat androgynous daughter she might look like this[one of].
	
But I am uncomfortable sharing a body, and uncomfortable looking into a mirror and seeing something other than my own face looking out. 

You seem calmer about it: perhaps you've just had more time to reflect, or perhaps somehow you're filtering those emotions out for me. But I think we'll both be happier when we're split back into our own respective bodies[or][stopping]."
	
Instead of attacking a mirror:
	say "You know what they say about bad luck. I'm not superstitious, but I don't think having a roomful of sharp glass shards bodes well for the immediate future."
	
Instead of burning something in the presence of a stove:
	if the noun is edible:
		say "You are about right about my cooking abilities, I suppose, but [the noun] [is-are] better off as [it-they] [is-are].";
	otherwise:
		say "It's true there's a handy stove here, but I don't see the point."
	
[And fix posture reporting to reflect person...]
	
The standard position report rule is not listed in any rulebook.

Report taking position (this is the new standard position report rule):
	say "[You] [are] now [the posture of the player][if the holder of the player is not the location] [in-on the holder of the player][end if]."

[And this is provided entirely as a way to redirect attempts to sit at the piano or a desk or table]	
Understand "sit at [something]" as sitting at. Sitting at is an action applying to one thing.

Check sitting at:
	say "There's no obvious place to sit." instead.
	

	
Section 3 - Bedrooms

A bed is a kind of supporter. A bed is always enterable. A bed is usually reclining.

When play begins:
	now every bed allows seated;
	now every bed allows reclining;
	now every bed which is not a dorm bed allows standing.

A clothed bed is a kind of bed. 

A blanket is a kind of thing. Some sheets are a kind of thing. A pillow is a kind of thing. Some sheets, a blanket, and a pillow are part of every clothed bed. 

Instead of taking something which is part of a clothed bed:
	say "Stripping down beds is boring, and none of the bedclothes are likely to be especially useful."

The description of a pillow is usually "Fluffy, harmless, mostly useless." The description of sheets is usually "They're the usual sort of thing." The description of a blanket is usually "Blankets in this part of the world, at this time of year, tend to be lightweight; and this is no exception."

A dorm bed is a kind of bed. 

Section 4 - Desks, Drawers, Offices


Include Automated Drawers by Emily Short. 

Definition: a container is empty if the number of things in it is 0.
Definition: a supporter is empty if the number of things on it is 0.

[After writing a paragraph about the nightstand:
	if something is on the nightstand and at least one surprising drawer is part of the nightstand, say "[paragraph break]";
	say "[if prior named noun is the nightstand and the nightstand is empty]It[otherwise]The nightstand[end if] has [the number of drawers which are part of the nightstand in words] drawer[s]";
	if at least one open drawer is part of the nightstand

		say "; [selection of drawers which are part of the nightstand conforming to the description open drawers which are part of the nightstand is-are] open";
		if every open drawer which is part of the nightstand is empty, say " but empty";
	end if;
	say ". ";
	now the current-subject is the nightstand;
	now every drawer which is part of the nightstand is mentioned;
	now every drawer which is part of the nightstand is referenced by the current-paragraph;
	while a surprising thing (called second special-target) is referenced by the current-paragraph
	begin; 
		carry out the disclosing contents activity with the second special-target;
		now every thing contained by the second special-target is mentioned;
		now every thing supported by the second special-target is mentioned;
		now every thing held by the second special-target is mentioned;
		now every thing which is part of the second special-target is mentioned;
	end while; 
	now held-break is true;
	say "[run paragraph on]"; ]
	

Rule for disclosing exterior of something which is in a drawer:
	say "[The current-subject] is in [the holder of the current-subject]. ";

Rule for disclosing contents of a drawer (called special-target):
	say "[if the prior named noun is the special-target]Inside[otherwise]In [the special-target][end if] [is-are a list of things in the special-target]. [run paragraph on]".
	
A desk is a kind of supporter. [Every desk incorporates two vertical drawers.] A desk is usually scenery. The description of a desk is usually "It's fakely veneered in dark wood and shows signs of years of abuse." A desk is usually seated.

A chair is a kind of supporter. A chair is usually scenery. A chair is always enterable. Understand "seat" as a chair. Understand "take [chair]" as entering. The description of a chair is usually "It is an ordinary inexpensive variety of chair, made locally and found around the island in great numbers." A chair is usually seated.

When play begins:
	now every chair allows seated;
	now every chair allows standing;
	now every desk allows seated;
	now every desk allows standing.

Before entering a chair which supports something (called the impediment):
	if the noun supports a person:
		say "[The noun] [is-are] plainly occupied." instead;
	otherwise:
		try taking the impediment;
		if the impediment is on the noun:
			stop the action. 
			
Rule for writing a topic sentence about an as-yet-unknown introduceable person (called special-target) who is on a chair (called secondary-target):
	now the secondary-target is mentioned;
	say "[The special-target] [is-are] sitting here. [run paragraph on]";
	now the current-paragraph references the special-target.
	
Rule for writing a paragraph about someone (called special-target) who is on a chair (called secondary-target):
	if the special-target is initially-described, make no decision;
	if the special-target is flexibly-described, make no decision;
	if the special-target is introduceable and the special-target is as-yet-unknown, make no decision;
	change the current-subject to special-target; 
	if the location is an office:
		now the secondary-target is mentioned;
		let N be a random desk which is in the location;
		say "[The special-target] [is-are] seated at [its-their] [N]. [run paragraph on]";
	otherwise:
		say "[The special-target] [is-are] sitting on [a secondary-target]. [run paragraph on]"; 

Rule for disclosing contents of a desk (called special-target):
	if someone (called desk-user) who is not the player is on a chair in the location:
		say "[if special-target is not mentioned]On [the special-target] in front of[otherwise]In front of[end if] [the desk-user] [is-are a list of mentionable things on the special-target]. [run paragraph on]";
	otherwise:
		make no decision;

An office is a kind of room. One desk and one chair are in every office. An office is usually indoors.

Sanity-check sitting at a desk:
	if the player can see a chair (called target chair) which does not support a person:
		try entering the target chair instead.

Section 5 - Outdoor Rooms and Digging
	
A thing can be diggable. A thing is usually not diggable.

Understand "hole in" or "in" or "up" or "a hole in" as "[hole in]".

Understand "dig [hole in] [something diggable]" or "dig [something diggable]" as digging in. Understand "dig [hole in] [something]" or "dig [something]" as digging in. Digging in is an action applying to one thing.

Understand the command "scoop" as "dig".

Sanity-check digging in a person:
	say "[The noun] do[es]n't have much in common with a mound of dirt." instead.
Sanity-check digging in a floppy wearable thing which is not diggable:
	say "...what, like looking through for pockets or something? No sign of anything interesting, I'm afraid." instead.

Check digging in:
	if the noun is not diggable:
		say "That seems pointless." instead.
	
Report digging in the soil:
	say "[You] try scooping away a few handfuls of the soil, but find nothing interesting in the process. [You][']re also getting dirt under our fingernails." instead.
	
Report digging in something diggable:
	say "Excavating a bit of [the noun] turns up nothing of interest."
	
Instead of looking under a diggable thing:
	try digging in the noun.
 

Part 4 - Special Prop Types

Chapter 1 - Information Sources

Section 1 - Books

A book is a kind of thing. Understand "book" as a book. A book has a table-name called the contents.

Before printing the name of a proper-named book: say "[italic type]".
After printing the name of a book: say "[roman type]".

After consulting a book about a topic listed in the contents of the noun:
	say "[reply entry][paragraph break]".

After consulting a book about:
	say "[You] flip through [the noun], but find no reference to [the topic understood]." instead.
	
Understand "look up [text] in [a book]" as consulting it about (with nouns reversed). Understand "read about [text] in [a book]" as consulting it about (with nouns reversed). 
Understand "look up [text]" as guidebook-consulting. Understand "read about [text]" as guidebook-consulting. Understand "look [text] up" as guidebook-consulting.
Understand "look [text] up in [a book]" as consulting it about (with nouns reversed). Understand "look [text] up in [something]" as consulting it about (with nouns reversed).

Check consulting a book about something (this is the take books to read them rule):
	if the player does not carry the noun:
		try taking the noun;
		if the player does not carry the noun:
			stop the action.

Guidebook-consulting is an action applying to one topic.

The guidebook-consulting action has an object called the implied textbook.

Setting action variables for guidebook-consulting:
	change the implied textbook to the player;
	if the player's command includes "[number]" and the filing cabinet is visible:
		change the implied textbook to the filing cabinet;
	otherwise if the player can see the guidebook:
		change the implied textbook to the guidebook; 
	otherwise if the player carries a book:
		change the implied textbook to a random book carried by the player;
	otherwise if the player can see a book (called the target):
		change the implied textbook to the target.

Check guidebook-consulting:
	if the implied textbook is the player:
		say "[You] don't have any suitable book in which to look that up." instead.

Carry out guidebook-consulting:
	try consulting the implied textbook about the topic understood.
	
Section 2 - Computers

[The computer code handles the idea of computers that are on and off, running multiple programs, password protection, email delivery (though we don't actually use that in this game), search engines, and multiple-choice engines. These support Waterstone's laptop (which we never interact with), the secretary's computer (which we can break into if we want, but it's just an easter egg), and the machinery that converts the letter-remover device to remove its legal limitations, as well as Atlantida's ebook reader in the endgame.

The code was originally written for Counterfeit Monkey, but I took it out, polished it up, and published it some years ahead of the game as an extension. This was useful to do: authors of other games pointed out a few flaws in that code that allowed me to improve the behavior for this game.]

Include Computers by Emily Short.

The description of a keyboard is usually "Arranged in the Dvorak layout preferred in Anglophone Atlantis."
 
When play begins:
	repeat with item running through search engines:
		now the results-found response of item is "The search turns up the following results:";
		now the description of the item is "[You] can type search terms to look for data records."

Chapter 2 - Substances

Section 1 - Liquids

[We could have used a full-bore liquid extension, but there's really no reason to do so: the player is not going to be allowed to mix liquids or have partial liquid quantities, and in fact we want to encourage him to think of all objects in the game universe as atomic rather than partial and divisible. 

So our minimal approach to fluids just disallows a few kinds of manipulation that apply to solids, and leaves it at that.]

A thing can be solid or fluid. A thing is usually solid.

Instead of waving or squeezing or pulling or pushing or rubbing or turning a fluid thing:
	say "[The noun] do[es]n't really respond to that kind of manipulation."

Sanity-check drinking a solid thing:
	say "[The noun] [is-are]n't liquid." instead.
	
Check drinking a fluid thing:
	try eating the noun instead.
	
Sanity-check burning a fluid thing:
	say "Only the rare fluid is able to burn." instead.
	
Sanity-check burning the fuel:
	say "Let's keep your arsonist tendencies under wraps. I think they might attract attention." instead.
	
Sanity-check burning oil:
	say "Let's keep your arsonist tendencies under wraps. I think they might attract attention." instead.
	
Rule for deciding whether all includes a fluid thing while taking:
	it does not.
	
Sanity-check tying a fluid to something:
	say "[The noun] do[es]n't make much of an anchor point." instead.
	
Sanity-check tying something to a fluid:
	say "[The second noun] do[es]n't make much of an anchor point." instead.
	
Sanity-check climbing a fluid thing:
	say "A prominent feature of fluids is that they don't provide much support." instead.

A thing can be contained or uncontained. A thing is usually uncontained.

Every turn when the player carries a fluid thing (called the puddle):
	unless the puddle is contained:
		move the puddle to the location;
		say "[The puddle][one of], true to its nature, leaks out onto the ground[or] drips through our fingers onto the ground[or] drips out of our hands[at random]."
		
		
Understand "fill [a container] with [a fluid thing]" as filling it with.
Understand "fill [a container] with [something]" as filling it with.
Understand "fill [something] with [a fluid thing]" as filling it with.
Understand "fill [something] with [something]" as filling it with.

Understand "pour [something] into [something]" as filling it with (with nouns reversed).
Understand "pour [a fluid thing] into [something]" as filling it with (with nouns reversed).
Understand "pour [something] into [a container]" as filling it with (with nouns reversed).
Understand "pour [a fluid thing] into [a container]" as filling it with (with nouns reversed).

Filling it with is an action applying to two things.

Sanity-check filling a container with something which is not a fluid thing:
	try inserting the second noun into the noun instead.

Check filling a contained fluid with a fluid thing:
	say "There's no restoration gel that will separate mixed liquids, you know. I'd rather stay away from the chemistry experiments." instead.

Check filling the funnel with a fluid thing: 
	say "That would have about the same effect as pouring [the second noun] on our feet." instead.

Check filling it with:
	say "[one of]I'd rather leave [the second noun] where [it-they] [is-are].[or]I don't see much point to filling containers with things.[at random]" instead.

	
Section 2 - Vegetables

A vegetable is a kind of thing. The description of a vegetable is usually "Some leafy greens that might make an okay side salad, if [you] were feeling hungry." A vegetable is usually edible.     

The scent-description of a vegetable is usually "vegetable matter".


[These two items are reserved for use in place of the pear and the banana during hard mode.]

The prickly-pear is a vegetable. The printed name is "prickly pear". The description of the prickly-pear is "It's a hostile red fruit covered with spines." Understand "prickly" and "pear" as the prickly-pear.
	
The pineapple is a vegetable. The description is "It is thick-skinned and spiky all over. I've never learned how to serve one of these things without getting juice over everything in a ten-foot radius."


Chapter 3 - Useful Items

Section 1 - Holdall

[For most of the time this game was in development, it used the backpack as a holdall and juggled the player's belongings in and out of it. Which worked fine, but it caused occasional irritations when one of the NPCs needed to give the player something, thereby exceeding his carrying capacity. 

But more than that, it started to feel like all this obsession about how you were carrying what was just not very interesting: not fun, not related to the main substance of the puzzles, and just distracting from the main text of the game. I removed most of the puzzles that had to do with inventory management, toned down the one that remained (dealing with the Authenticator), revised the inventory listing to de-emphasize containment, and got rid of the carrying capacity constraint.

So, yeah, it's not remotely realistic that we can carry around all the stuff we carry in the game -- but it wouldn't be realistic stuffed into a backpack *either*. And not worrying about this gets the game *out of the way* of a lot of the core puzzle interactions, which are what the player should be focused on instead.]

[Include Considerate Holdall by Jon Ingold.

When play begins:
	now every long thing is unstashable;
	now the iron-pans are unstashable;
	now every fluid thing is unstashable.
	
The carrying capacity of the player is 10. ]

[And now for the cases where the player explicitly tries to stash something inappropriate, e.g. with PUT ALE IN BACKPACK: ]
	
Instead of inserting a long thing into the backpack:
	say "[The noun] [one of]couldn't possibly fit[or]would be much too long[or]would just stick out[at random]."
	
Instead of inserting a fluid thing into the backpack:
	say "[The noun] [one of]would make a real mess[or]would just spill[at random]."
	
Instead of inserting the pans into the backpack:
	say "There's nowhere near enough room."

Section 2 - Clothing

[Our clothing simulation is as lightweight as we can make it. The aim is 

-- to avoid breaking immersion by having the player simultaneously wear things that ought to overlap, like the monocle and the goggles
-- to juggle clothing automatically so that the player never has to worry about explicitly taking off one piece of clothing to wear another

Though there are provisions in the manual for clothing systems that handle layering, describing outfits based on what's uppermost, and specifying body parts, we want to avoid all of that. Naming body parts would clash with the "arm", "toe", and other severed body bits that appear elsewhere in the game, while layering would draw our attention to the fact that the protagonist's original outfit is never clearly described. We want to focus player attention as much as possible away from those points.

Any article of clothing which can be stacked freely -- rings, wraps, jewelry, etc -- is not said to cover anything. We also do not bother to specify a coverage area for items of clothing that the player will never get his hands on -- those worn by NPCs.]

Body-area is a kind of value. The body-areas are face-area, head-area, torso-area, legs-area.

Covering relates various things to one body-area. The verb to cover (it covers, they cover, it is covering, it is covered) implies the covering relation.

[Strip off anything else that's in the way -- which should be only one thing, really, but we write it as a loop just in case.]

Check wearing something which covers a body-area (called affected region):
	if the affected region is not the face-area and the affected region is not the head-area and the affected region is not the torso-area and the affected region is not the legs-area: [* you would think this was covered already, but for some reason there's a bug at time of writing that allows "which covers a body area" to match "illegal body-area" -- that is to say, no part of the body at all.]
		make no decision; 
	while the player wears a non-noun thing (called blockage) which covers the affected region:
		try taking off the blockage;
		if the player wears the blockage:
			stop the action.
			
Definition: a thing is non-noun if it is not the noun.

[...and to deal with the special case of objects worn as blindfolds:]
			
Check wearing something which covers face-area  when the player wears something blinding:
	while the player wears a blinding thing (called blockage):
		try taking off the blockage;
		if the player wears the blockage:
			stop the action.
			
			
Report taking off something which covers face-area:
	say "[You] gently remove [the noun]." instead.
	
Report taking off something which covers head-area:
	say "[You] pull off [the noun] and smoothe down our hair." instead.
	
Report wearing something which covers head-area:
	say "[You] settle [the noun] on our head and adjust our hair underneath." instead.
			
Test wardrobe with "tutorial off / cycle wardrobe / wear ben wig / wear monocle / blindfold me with swatch / wear monocle".

Section 3 - Signs

A sign is a kind of thing.

Section 4 - Writing Surfaces

[This is a pretty unimportant feature, but at some point during the design I realized that it was possible to make pens, a nib, and various types of paper and notepad. Given that, it seemed fair to let the player write stuff down — he was likely to try, anyhow — and maybe I could tie in an achievement or two. 

I didn't really greatly want to develop that from scratch, but happily an extension by Jim Aikin provided the functionality: writeable surfaces that would remember what you'd jotted on them, work only with certain writing implements, etc. I plugged it in, tested it out (worked perfectly), and moved on.]

Include Notepad by Jim Aikin.

Understand "write on [something]" as a mistake ("You'll need to say what you want to write down, as in 'write Alice on [the noun]'."). 

Understand "write with [something]" as a mistake ("You'll need to say what you want to write down, as in 'write Alice on [the random notepad]'."). 

Understand "write on [something] with [something]" as a mistake ("You'll need to say what you want to write down, as in 'write Alice on [the noun]'."). 

Understand "write with [something] on [something]" as a mistake ("You'll need to say what you want to write down, as in 'write Alice on [the second noun]'."). 


Sanity-check an actor writing on something:
	if the actor carries the inked pen:
		make no decision;
	if the actor carries the uninked pen:
		say "[The pen] is out of ink at the moment." instead;
	if the actor carries the pens:
		say "[The pens] are only nominally writing implements at all." instead.
	


		
Section 5 - Instruments and Performance

[I am not great at music — that is, I really enjoy listening to it, but theory, analysis, and most musical performance is beyond my ability, and I have the sort of singing voice I would only dare exercise when hiking alone in a wilderness preserve. 

So there was no initial plan to feature anything about instruments; it just turned out that several introduced themselves into the game, either as scenery (the piano in the Fleur d'Or) or as makeable objects (the oboe). Once enough of them turned up, I figured I should handle them in some systematic fashion.]
	
An instrument is a kind of thing. Understand "instrument" as an instrument.

After reading a command:
	if the player's command includes "play darts" and the location is the Counterfeit Monkey:
		replace the matched text with "playdarts";
	if the player's command includes "play" and the location is not the Counterfeit Monkey:
		replace the matched text with "perform". [This is a hack because we have to get around "play" also turning up in dialogue for the game at the Counterfeit Monkey.]
		
Understand "perform [something] on [something]" as performing it on. Understand "perform [piece] on [instrument]" as performing it on. Understand "perform [something] on [instrument]" as performing it on.

Understand "perform on [instrument]" or "perform [instrument]" as performing vaguely on.
Understand "perform [piece]" or "perform [something]" as performing it on.

Performing it on is an action applying to one visible thing and one thing.
Performing vaguely on is an action applying to one thing.

Sanity-check performing vaguely on something:
	try performing the player on the noun instead.

Rule for supplying a missing second noun while performing something on:
	if an instrument (called target instrument) is visible:
		now the second noun is the target instrument;
	otherwise:
		if game-selection is visible:
			now the second noun is the game-selection;
		else:
			say "There's no instrument handy." instead.
		
Rule for supplying a missing noun while performing something on:
	now the noun is the player. [as a safe generically-present thing]
	
Sanity-check performing something on game-selection:
	say "It's not really a game-playing occasion." instead.

Sanity-check performing something on a person: 
	say "If [the second noun] wish[es] to sing something, that is up to [it-them]." instead.

Sanity-check performing something on something which is not an instrument:
	say "[The second noun] [is-are]n't much of an instrument." instead.

Understand "perform [text] on [something]" as improvising it on. Understand "perform [text] on [instrument]" as improvising it on. Improvising it on is an action applying to one topic and one thing.

Understand "perform [text]" as improvising it on.

Rule for supplying a missing second noun while improvising the topic understood on:
	if an instrument (called target instrument) is visible:
		now the second noun is the target instrument;
	otherwise:
		say "There's no instrument handy." instead.

Check improvising the topic understood on something which is not an instrument:
	say "[The second noun] [is-are]n't much of an instrument." instead.
 

Part 5 - Extra Actions

Section 1 - Swimming and other Seaside Activities

Swimming is an action applying to one visible thing.

Understand "swim [a direction]" as swimming.

Understand "swim" or "float" as swimming.

Rule for supplying a missing noun while swimming:
	if the location is not swimmable:
		say "[You][']d need to be closer to the shore.";
		rule fails;
	otherwise:
		now the noun is north.

Check swimming:
	if the location is not swimmable:
		say "[You][']d need to be closer to the shore." instead.
	
Check swimming (this is the block swimming off the boat rule):
	if the location is nautical:

Instead of swimming something when the location is the Customs Hallway or the location is the precarious perch:
	say "From up here? Unlikely. And even from the water's edge, it would be better to have a boat."
	
Instead of swimming something when [the Holding Chamber is not visited and] the location is the Docks:
	say "Going swimming in these murky waters isn't an appealing thought, and anyway [you] don't have time for a pleasure dip just now."

Section 2 - Attacking it with
 
[This is here primarily for the pinata puzzle, but also to give sensible responses to a number of other things, including attempts at combat with Atlantida.]

Understand the commands "attack" and "punch" and "destroy" and "kill" and "murder" and "hit" and "thump" and "break" and "smash" and "torture" and "wreck" as something new.

Attacking it with is an action applying to one visible thing and one carried thing. Understand "attack [something] with [something preferably held]" as attacking it with.

Understand the commands "punch" and "destroy" and "kill" and "murder" and "hit" and "thump" and "break" and "smash" and "torture" and "wreck" as "attack".
 
Does the player mean attacking the hanging figure with a long strong thing:
	it is very likely.

Sanity-check attacking something with something:
	if the second noun is not long:
		say "[The second noun] [is-are] too short to hit with effectively." instead;
	if the second noun is floppy:

Sanity-check attacking something which is not attackable with an edged thing:
	try cutting the noun with the second noun instead.

Understand "swing [something preferably held] at [something]" as attacking it with (with nouns reversed).


Book 4 - Features of Created Objects

Section 1 - Legality

[Legality reflects whether something can be carried safely in the presence of the authorities and whether it should be noticed by them. ]

A thing can be legal or illegal. A thing is usually legal.

Before going to a room that encloses a police person when the player has a backpack:
	if the room gone to is the fish Market:
		do nothing instead;
	stow gear.
	
Before approaching a room that encloses a police person when the player has a backpack:
	if the room gone to is the fish Market:
		do nothing instead;
	stow gear.
	
To stow gear:
	repeat with item running through illegal things which are enclosed by the player:
		if the item is visible and the item is not in the backpack:
			try inserting the item into the backpack;
	if the backpack is open:
		try closing the backpack.
		
Before taking something which is in a closed container (called the source):
	try opening the source.
	
Before inserting something into a closed container (called the goal):
	try opening the goal.

Before inserting something which is worn into a container:
	try taking off the noun.

Every turn:
	if a police person (called suspicious official) can see an illegal thing (called the evidence) which is not in a closed backpack:
		say "The attention of [the suspicious official] lights on [the evidence]. 'Let's see [that-those of the evidence],' [it-they of the suspicious official] say[s]. [paragraph break]Of course, a minute's inspection doesn't make [it-them] any happier, and soon [you] find ourselves explaining things to the police.";
		end the game saying "That was careless".



Section 2 - Proffering and thing relations

A thing can be useful or useless. A thing is usually useless.  

Proffering relates various things to various things. The verb to proffer (it proffers, they proffer, it proffered, it is proffered) implies the Proffering relation. [This relation indicates which objects have been derived verbally from which others.]

When play begins: 
	repeat with item running through things:
		now the item proffers the item; 
	now the rock is not proffered by anything;
	now Brock proffers the rock;
	now the banana is not proffered by anything;
	now the bandana proffers the banana; 
	now the shed is not proffered by anything;
	now the shred proffers the shed;
	now the as is not proffered by anything;
	now the pastis proffers the as;
	now the ash is not proffered by anything;
	now the trash proffers the ash;
	now the pear is not proffered by anything;
	now the pearl proffers the pear; 
	now the lock is not proffered by anything;
	now the lock is proffered by the clock;
	now the watch is not proffered by anything;
	now the watch is proffered by the swatch; 
	now the mechanic is not proffered by anything;
	now the garbage proffers the mechanic;
	now the pocket-bread is not proffered by anything;
	now the pocket-bread is proffered by the pita;
	now the honey triangle is not proffered by anything;
	now the honey triangle is proffered by the baklava;
	now the crossword is not proffered by anything;
	now the crossword is proffered by the cross;
	now the crossword is proffered by the word;
	now the word is not proffered by anything;
	now the word is proffered by the sword;
	now atlantida-woman is not proffered by anything;
	now atlantida-shellfish proffers atlantida-woman;  
	now the paperweight is not proffered by anything;
	now the paperweight is proffered by the paper;
	now the paperweight is proffered by the weight;
	now the lamb-granulates are not proffered by anything;
	now the lamb-granulates are proffered by the anagram bullets;
	now the inciting fable is not proffered by anything;
	now the filing cabinet proffers the inciting fable.
	[now the bead is not proffered by anything;
	now the bead is proffered by the fancy bed;]
	[now the vest is not proffered by anything;
	now the vet proffers the vest. ]

A thing can be seen or unseen. A thing is usually unseen. 

After printing the name of something (called special-target): 
	if the special-target is a quip or the special-target is a subject:
		do nothing;
	otherwise if the special-target is not in the repository:
		now the special-target is seen.

A thing can be fake or real. A thing is usually real.

When play begins:
	now every thing enclosed by the repository is fake;
	now patsy-woman is real;
	now Brock is real.   
  
Definition: a thing is discovered if it is fake and it is seen.
	
 
 





Section 3 - Concreteness 

A thing can be r-concrete or r-abstract. A thing is usually r-concrete.

Sanity-check rubbing or squeezing or touching or waving or pulling or pushing or turning or climbing an r-abstract thing:
	say "[The noun] [is-are] not really solid enough to treat that way. Might as well be [one of]dandelion fluff[or]pipe smoke[or]a hologram[or]a 3D image[or]mist[or]a cloud of vapor[at random]." instead.
	
Sanity-check eating or drinking or tasting an r-abstract thing:
	say "[The noun] [is-are] too abstract to offer sustenance." instead.
Sanity-check  pushing an r-abstract thing to a direction:
	say "[The noun] [is-are]n't solid enough for that kind of treatment." instead.
Sanity-check switching on or switching off an r-abstract thing:
	if the noun is a device:
		make no decision;
	say "[The noun] [is-are]n't literally a projection; [it-they] [is-are] more of a concept created by the group mind of this language community. Sort of. [You] think. At any rate, [it-they] do[es]n't switch on and off." instead.

Section 4 - Heft

A thing has a number called heft. The heft of a thing is usually 2. The heft of an animal is usually 4. The heft of an insect is usually 1. The heft of a bird is usually 2. The heft of a person is usually 4. The heft of a vehicle is usually 5. The heft of a supporter is usually 5.

The verb to weigh (it weighs, they weigh, it is weighing) implies the heft property.

Definition: a thing is heavy if its heft is greater than 3.

Every turn when the player carries a heavy thing (called burden): 
	try involuntarily-dropping the burden. 
	
Sanity-check waving a heavy thing:
	say "Unlikely, unless we suddenly become a good deal stronger." instead.
	
Involuntarily-dropping is an action applying to one thing.

Carry out involuntarily-dropping something which is not a person:
	now the noun is handled.

Carry out involuntarily-dropping:
	try silently dropping the noun; [this is better than just moving to the location because it copes with cases where the thing needs to land in a vehicle or supporter.]
	if the player carries the noun:
		stop the action.
	
Report involuntarily-dropping:
	say "[The noun] [is-are] [if the heft of the noun is greater than 4]far too large[otherwise]too awkward[end if] for us to carry, and fall[s] onto the ground." instead.
	
Report involuntarily-dropping an animal:
	say "[The noun] [is-are] [if the heft of the noun is greater than 4]far too large[otherwise]too awkward[end if] for us to carry, and half-fall[s], half-jump[s] to the ground." instead.
	
Report involuntarily-dropping the boar:
	now the boar is in the location;
	say "[You] more or less throw the boar as far away as possible. It seems the wisest course." instead.
	
Report involuntarily-dropping a person:
	say "[The noun] look[s] rather awkward, and clamber[s] out of our ineffective hold onto solid ground." instead.
	
Report involuntarily-dropping a cat:
	say "[The noun] get[s] tired of being carried and leap[s] delicately to the ground." instead.

Section 5 - Length and Strength

A thing can be short or long. A thing is usually short.

A thing can be strong or floppy. A thing is usually strong.

Sanity-check swinging a long thing:
	if the noun is strong:
		say "[You] might hit something with [the noun]." instead.

Instead of swinging a long thing:
	if the noun is wearable:
		say "[You] swing [the noun] dashingly over a shoulder. I feel foolish now.";
	otherwise:
		say "[You] swing [the noun] from one hand, to no special effect."
Sanity-check swinging a short thing: 
	if the noun is not a person:
		say "There's not really a lot of extent to [the noun] to make [it-them] satisfying to swing." instead.

Section 6 - Politeness

A thing can be crude or polite. A thing is usually polite.

A thing can be naughty-sounding or innocent-sounding. 



Section 7 - Edges and Cutting


[We could in theory use an object property for these, but there are nearly 2000 objects in the game and that would be a bit of storage overkill when we want only two or three objects to correspond to the definition.]

Definition: a thing is edged if it is the jigsaw or it is the sword.
Definition: a thing is cuttable if it is the kudzu or it is the plexiglas.

Understand the command "cut" as something new. Understand "cut [something] with [something preferably held]" as cutting it with. Understand "cut [something] with [an edged thing]" as cutting it with. Cutting it with is an action applying to one thing and one carried thing.

Sanity-check cutting something which is not cuttable with something:
	if the second noun is edged:
		if the noun is a person:
			say "Sometimes I find your sense of hum[our] grotesque." instead;
		otherwise:
			say "I think that would only make a mess." instead;
	else:
		say "[The second noun] do[es]n't offer much of an edge, but that's probably just as well really." instead.
		
Sanity-check cutting something cuttable with something which is not edged:
	say "[The second noun] do[es]n't offer much of an edge." instead. 
 
Check cutting something with the jigsaw when the jigsaw is not switched on:
	try switching on the jigsaw;
	if the jigsaw is not switched on:
		say "It's impossible to use a jigsaw that is not turned on." instead.



	
Book 5 - Schedule and Time

Chapter 1 - Time Model

Section 1 - Speed of Action

[This game is going to entail taking inventory constantly, as the player reviews what he has available to solve a particular problem. Similarly, looking and examining things in order to check the environment for dangerous or interesting content. Consequently, we want these actions to be timeless so that they don't pose too much of a challenge in timed portions. Besides, during a conversation or otherwise wordy scene, it tends to be unattractive to have a whole inventory list followed by the section of dialogue.

This code is yanked directly from the "Timeless" example in the manual.]

Examining something is acting fast. Looking is acting fast. Taking inventory is acting fast. 

[Starting a conversation with someone about is acting fast. ]

The take visual actions out of world rule is listed before the every turn stage rule in the turn sequence rules.
This is the take visual actions out of world rule: 
	if acting fast:
		rule succeeds.



Section 2 - Times of Day

Daytime is a kind of value. The daytimes are noon, early afternoon, mid afternoon, late afternoon, sunset, and evening.

The current daytime is a daytime that varies. The current daytime is noon.

		-- late afternoon:
			say "The glare is decreasing as the sun falls toward the horizon, and the sky overhead is a darker shade of blue.[no line break]";
		-- sunset:
			say "There are no clouds to complicate the sunset, just a pure gradient of yellow to deepening blue.[no line break]";
		-- evening:
			say "The sky has cooled to a darkening blue, though [you] can't see any stars yet.[no line break]"

To say sun-description:
	if the current daytime is:

Test time-settings with "tempus / clock advance / tempus / clock advance / tempus / clock advance / tempus / clock advance / tempus / clock advance / tempus / clock advance".

Understand "Tempus" as time-testing. Time-testing is an action out of world.

Carry out time-testing:

Report advancing-clock:
	say "It is now [current daytime]."
			
Chapter 2 - Scenes

Section 1 - Recovering Stowed Objects

Playing to plan is a scene. Playing to plan begins when play begins. Playing to plan ends when High Street is visited.

When playing to plan ends:
	now the current daytime is early afternoon;
	record "Finished tutorial mode" as an achievement;
	say "From a loudspeaker nearby comes the electronic sound of simulated bells ringing the hour after noon. It's later than I thought. [You][']d better get a move on."
	
Section 2 - Looking for Transport
	
Seeking transport is a scene. Seeking transport begins when playing to plan ends. Seeking transport ends when the Counterfeit Monkey is visited.

When seeking transport ends:
	remove the farmer from play;
	remove the farmer's stall from play; [We want to give the sense of change here, and also get the farmer out of the way before he can be transformed into a FAME abstraction.]
	now the current daytime is mid afternoon;
	assign "Ask people around here if they've seen Slango" at Counterfeit Monkey;
	say "...and... Slango is not here.
	
This is bad. Even I can see this is bad. What happened to your confidence in your team? Where are the guys who are supposed to get us out of here?

Something must have gone wrong."; 
	
Section 3 - Missing Slango

Seeking Slango is a scene. Seeking Slango begins when Seeking transport ends. Seeking Slango ends when Slango is seen.

When seeking Slango ends:
	[remove the protesters from play;]
	now the current daytime is late afternoon.

Section 4 - Academia

Seeking invite is a scene. Seeking invite begins when Seeking Slango ends. Seeking invite ends when the player carries the invitation.

When seeking invite ends:
	record "acquiring a sought-after invitation" as achieved;
[	say "[command prompt]";
	wait for any key;
	say "[paragraph break]I'm not sure I can handle this. The university stuff is one thing. I know my way around here. But [you] could be about to get into some real trouble. And I can tell you don't believe my plan has a chance of doing much good. You don't, do you? >>";
	if the player consents:
		say "[line break]Heh. I don't think you mean that, but it's kind of you to humor me.";
	otherwise:
		say "[line break]No. But you're right: for good or ill, [you][']ll be out."]
		
Before going to University Oval:
	if "Trace Brock's movements at the antique shop" is completed:
		make no decision; 
	if hurrying:
		let N be the number of entries in the path so far of the player;
		if N is greater than 1: 
			say "[path-walked so far][paragraph break]";
		otherwise:
			clear the path-walked for the player;  
		now approach-destination is Samuel Johnson Hall;
	say "There are a couple of All-Purpose Officers standing not-that-inconspicuously around campus. I still think we could walk around in there if we wanted to, but you aren't all that keen. And I guess it is possible that they're looking for students associated with the protests today." instead. 

		
Section 5 - Higgate's Arrest

[Because we need to stop you so so that you see the scene if you're just passing through:]
After going to University Oval when seeking invite has ended and higgate-arrested has not happened : 
	let N be the number of entries in the path so far of the player;
	if N is greater than 1: 
		say "[path-walked so far][paragraph break]";
	otherwise:
		clear the path-walked for the player;  
	now approach-destination is Samuel Johnson Hall. [Tricks the approaching verb into stopping here even if you're trying to reach someplace really far away.]
	[pause the game. ]

Higgate-arrested is a scene. Higgate-arrested begins when the location is University Oval and seeking invite has ended.
	

When Higgate-arrested begins:
	now officers are in the location;
	now Professor Higgate is not alert;
	now Professor Brown is not alert;
	move Professor Brown to the location;
	move Professor Higgate to the location;
	say "There are a couple of officers lounging by the university gate. We won't be able to go by without being seen.

As I'm taking this in, you notice hubbub behind us. We move out of the way as more officers escort Professor Higgate from the building.";


Some officers are a man. The description of the officers is "I don't see anyone I recognize. There are two escorting Higgate and two more at the oval gate, as backup [--] presumably in case she decided to make a run for it."
	
A dangerous destruction rule for the officers:
	say "The moment the officers change, two more come running through the gate. Might have known they wouldn't be operating without backup.
	
One of them fires a restoration gel rifle into the group, restoring the officers to their original form. The other has an authentication scope and sweeps the grounds for signs of anything suspicious. We're noticed and arrested almost at once.

'What is going on?' Higgate demands. Her glance skates over us. There's a look in her eyes that says she has a guess who we are and she's not at all eager to have that guess confirmed.";
	end the story saying "That was not the best moment to intervene"

Instead of saying hello to Higgate during Higgate-arrested:
	if we are forewarned:
		say "We approach Higgate, heart hammering. 'Professor Higgate, is everything all right?'

The officer nearest us turns on us, looking more startled than anything else [--] startled that anyone would be fool enough to intervene in a Bureau matter.

'She's a student,' Higgate says. 'I was just speaking with her earlier. I don't think she's close with Alex. I've never seen you two together, have I?' she concludes, looking at us.

This well-meant speech doesn't seem to clear suspicion as effectively as Higgate might have hoped, however, and soon we find ourselves being scooped up for questioning in the same van they sent for Higgate. It doesn't go well.";
	end the story saying "Perhaps silence would've been better"
	
Instead of saying hello to officers during Higgate-arrested:
	if we are forewarned:
		say "'Sir,' we begin.
	
'Back off, lady,' says the officer. [getting-caught]";
	end the story saying "That was not the most successful approach"
	
To say getting-caught:
	say "'Unless you know where to find Alex Rosehip. You a friend of his?'

We shake our head, but something about our appearance and demean[our] has the officer's attention. 'I see a little bit of a family resemblance, come to think of it,' he remarks.

'Everyone's related to everyone,' Higgate says. 'If you check into DNA studies of the island you'll find that it's extremely inbr[--]'

'Thank you, Professor Higgate, you can save the rest of your lecture for inside the van,' says the escorting officer. 'And you come too,' he adds, to us.";

higgate-arrest-warning is a truth state that varies.

To decide whether we are forewarned:
	if higgate-arrest-warning is true:
		decide yes;
	say "We might not want to attract attention if we can help it.";
	now higgate-arrest-warning is true;
	decide no.
	
Instead of approaching somewhere during Higgate-arrested:
	if we are forewarned:
		say "We start to stroll off. The officer nearest us notices. 'I'm going to have to ask you to stay where you are until we've completed our sweep of the area,' he says. [getting-caught]";
		end the story saying "Maybe standing still would have been better".
Instead of going somewhere during Higgate-arrested:
	if we are forewarned:
		say "We start to stroll off. The officer nearest us notices. 'I'm going to have to ask you to stay where you are until we've completed our sweep of the area,' he says. [getting-caught]";
		end the story saying "Maybe standing still would have been better".
	
Instead of examining Professor Brown during Higgate-arrested:
	say "He's standing some feet away but not actually walking off. It's not clear whether he expects the officers to ask him other questions, or whether he's lurking [--] guiltily? gleefully? [--] to discover the outcome of his little tip. 
	
When we try to meet his eye, he stares away at a tree."

Instead of examining Professor Higgate during Higgate-arrested:
	if the number of filled rows in the Table of Arrest Events is 1:
		say "There's an empty look in her eyes, as though she'd just been diagnosed with an inoperable cancer. She's thinking about Cold Storage. Anyone would be.";
	otherwise:
		say "She mostly looks irritated, as though she thinks the Bureau has made an awkward mistake that will soon be set right. There's a bit of a flush in her cheeks."


Every turn during Higgate-arrested:
	repeat through the Table of Arrest Events:
		if there is a description entry:
			say "[description entry][paragraph break]";
			blank out the whole row;
			break;

Table of Arrest Events
description
"'There's been a mistake,' Higgate is saying coolly. 'That conversation was conducted under a special lic[ense] for research in constructed languages. I can produce a copy [--]'

The officer leading her says, 'We're acting on information.' He gives a quick, revealing glance in the direction of Professor Brown, who is also coming out of the building."
"'Alex Rosehip,' says the officer with Higgate. The back of my neck prickles. 'What can you tell me about his constructed language?'

Higgate stops moving forward and the officers stop with her. 'It really is a masterpiece [--] the root words are all based on resources common in the tropics. Dirt and mud are highly productive terms, as are many common pests. The syllables are consonant-dense but still relatively easy to pronounce. In my view, it's the most credible proposal ever put forward in utopian linguistics.'

The officer smiles faintly. 'Isn't that a bit like [']the world's most credible proposal for a perpetual motion engine[']?'"
"'Whether it works or not, I [i]am[/i] sure it's not intended as an attack on the Anglophone efficacy,' Higgate says. 'Alex has a fine mind but very little gumption. And he loves Atlantis.'

'As far as you're aware,' the officer replies.

'Obviously,' Higgate snaps. 'I can only tell you what I know of Alex from five years of close supervision.'

The officers look at one another, then back at her. 'We're going to need to continue this conversation in depth.'

A stricken expression crosses Higgate's face."
"'I'd like to make a call,' Higgate says.
	
'Not possible,' says the man at her elbow.

'I assert my right to a friendly witness,' she says firmly. They ignore her."

Instead of waiting during Higgate-arrested:
	say "Time crawls by[one of]. We're looking as harmless and inattentive as humanly possible[or][stopping]."

Higgate-arrested ends when the number of filled rows in the Table of Arrest Events is 0.

When Higgate-arrested ends:
	remove the officers from play;
	remove Professor Higgate from play;
	remove Professor Brown from play;
	say "The officers sweep Higgate away into a windowless van. 'Mobile Conversation Unit,' says the side of the van in bright cheery letters. 'The Bureau Is Listening to YOU!'

The van pulls away into traffic. Brown strolls away in the other direction, not meeting anyone's eye. It's not easy getting tenure around here."



Section 6 - Pinata Celebration

Pinata Celebration is a scene. Pinata Celebration begins when the player encloses the invitation. Pinata Celebration ends when the hanging Atlantida figure is not in Tall Street.

Rule for distantly describing Tall Street when Pinata Celebration is happening:
	say "The whole of Tall Street is crowded with families."
	
Instead of listening to Tall Street during Pinata Celebration:
	try listening to the assembled families.
	
Instead of listening to assembled families:
	say "[one of]'Mommmmmy,' whines one of the children. 'When does the candy come out?'[or]They are muttering about how solid the Atlantida figure seems to be this year.[or]'It just goes to show,' one of the bureau officials says to another. 'The spirit of the Atlantean people cannot be broken!'[at random]"

Instead of going south from Tall Street during Pinata Celebration:
	say "[path-walked so far][if hurrying]We get as far as Tall Street, but no further. [end if]The Bureau entrance is temporarily blocked by all the excited families on the stairs, trying to destroy the cardboard figure of Atlantida."

When Pinata Celebration begins:
	move the hanging Atlantida figure to Tall Street;
	move the assembled families to Tall Street;
	now the current daytime is sunset;
	now the description of Tall Street is "Tall Street is full of families, some reaching as far as the old park at the east end of the street. 

They're gathered around a hanging cardboard figure in front of the Bureau of Orthography. The children, and a few of the adults, are taking turns hitting it with sticks, hoping for a shower of comma-shaped candy. This is a common holiday activity, but from the disgruntled comments and the petulant expressions of the children, it has already been going on longer than is strictly fun."

When Pinata Celebration ends:
	if the player is in Tall Street:
		say "The children gather their heaps of candy and a few scoops of glittery confetti as well, but eventually trickle away again with their parents, returning through the park or down side streets or to their cars.";
	remove the assembled families from play;
	record "breaking the Spirit of Atlantis (in cardboard form)" as achieved;
	now the description of Tall Street is "Tall Street has a distinctive post-party look, with confetti and glitter on the ground, and shreds of destroyed cardboard everywhere. It is quiet now, however.";
	move confetti mess to Tall Street.
	
A confetti mess is scenery. Understand "glitter" as the confetti mess. The description is "Blue, white, and silver glittery confetti is all over the place. The individual bits look like punctuation marks, commas and periods and the odd hash sign or ampersand."

The hanging Atlantida figure is an attackable closed container. It is scenery. The description is "The figure is made of cardboard and papier-mâché, designed for children to hit with sticks until candy and treats fall out: it's what would be called a piñata, if that weren't a dangerous loan word.

This particular one is made in the shape of Atlantida. She wears Bureau blue and a surreal smile and her eyes have been painted on wrong."

Some assembled families are a plural-named man. They are scenery. The description is "There are children of all ages carrying sticks and blindfolds they brought from home, as well as bags to scoop up the candy when everything is over. Parents, looking variously indulgent or bored. A couple of bureau officials, come out from the Rotunda to make sure that everything goes well." Understand "family" or "parents" or "parent" or "child" or "children" or "officials" or "bureau officials" or "bored" or "crowd" or "people" or "person" as the assembled families.

Every turn during Pinata Celebration:
	if the location is Tall Street:
		if a random chance of 2 in 3 succeeds:
			say "[one of]Another child takes a whack at the hanging figure. She bounces away from the blow, but does not break[or]The latest child's attack swings wide of the figure[or]The next child doesn't seem to have been properly blindfolded and connects with surprising dexterity and sureness, but the thing doesn't break[or]Among a general rumble of assent, one of the fathers gives Atlantida a hard smack with a baseball bat. She doesn't crack[cycling].";
	if the location is Abandoned Park:
		if a random chance of 2 in 3 succeeds:
			say "[one of]From the west comes a sound of cheering and shouting[or]The crowd to the west boos as one[at random]."

Sanity-check cutting the hanging Atlantida figure with an edged thing:
	say "I believe that would be considered very poor sportsmanship; one should at least try to play along in the spirit of the game." instead.

Instead of listening to Abandoned Park during Pinata Celebration:
	say "The crowd to the west is noisy and getting noisier."

Instead of taking the hanging Atlantida figure:
	say "Stealing the figure would certainly go over badly with the assembled families."
	
Understand "blindfold" as a thing when the item described is blinding.
	 
	
Definition: a thing is a blindfold:
	if it is not wearable:
		no;
	if it is not floppy:
		no;
	if the heft of it is 1:
		yes;
	no.

Instead of wearing a blindfold thing when the player can see the Atlantida figure:
	try blindfolding the player with the noun instead.

After printing the name of something blinding while taking inventory:
	say " (worn as a blindfold)";
	omit contents in listing.
	
Understand "blindfold [something] with [something preferably held]" as blindfolding it with. Blindfolding it with is an action applying to one thing and one carried thing.

Does the player mean blindfolding the player with a blindfold thing:
	it is very likely.

A thing can be blinding. A thing is usually not blinding.

Sanity-check blindfolding something which is not a person with something:
	say "[You] can only blindfold people." instead.
Sanity-check blindfolding someone with something which is not wearable:
	say "[The second noun] cannot be worn at all." instead.
Sanity-check blindfolding someone with something which is not floppy:
	say "[The second noun] [is-are] too stiff to wrap around one's face." instead.
Sanity-check blindfolding someone with something when the heft of the second noun is greater than 1:
	if the second noun is not wearable or the second noun is not floppy:
		make no decision;
	say "[The second noun] [is-are] too substantial to tie neatly around the eyes." instead.
Sanity-check blindfolding someone who is not the player with something:
	say "Better let people apply their own blindfolds, if they're so inclined." instead.

Sanity-check blindfolding the player with something when the player wears a blinding thing (called other strip):
	say "[You][']ve already got [the other strip] tied over our eyes." instead.
	
Check blindfolding the player with something when the player wears something which covers the face-area:
	while the player wears something (called blockage) which covers the face-area:
		try taking off the blockage;
		if the player wears the blockage:
			stop the action.
			
Check blindfolding the player with something when the player wears something which covers the head-area:
	while the player wears something (called blockage) which covers the head-area:
		try taking off the blockage;
		if the player wears the blockage:
			stop the action.

Carry out blindfolding the player with something:
	now the player wears the second noun;
	now the second noun is blinding.

Report blindfolding the player with something:
	say "[You] tie [the second noun] over our eyes. To be honest, it only partially obscures our vision; [you] still have a pretty good idea where everything is." instead.
	
Instead of going somewhere when the player wears a blinding thing:
	say "I'd prefer [you] didn't try to navigate in this half-sighted way. It's enough of a trick sharing the steering when we can both see."
	
Instead of looking when the player wears a blinding thing:
	let item be a random scenery thing in the location;
	say "[You] can only make out a little of our surroundings. I think the thing in front of us might be [an item]";
	if the hanging figure is visible and the hanging figure is not the item:
		say ". And the hanging figure is just in striking range.";
	otherwise:
		say "."

A first smarter parser rule when sp_normal:
	if input starts with "(attack|punch|destroy|kill|murder|hit|thump|break|smash|torture|wreck)" and the latest parser error is the can't see any such thing error:
		rule succeeds;
	if input starts with "blindfold" and the latest parser error is the can't see any such thing error:
		rule succeeds;
	if input starts with "wear" and input contains "blindfold" and the latest parser error is the can't see any such thing error:
		rule succeeds.
	
Carry out taking off something which is blinding:
	now the noun is not blinding.

Understand "wear [something] as a blindfold" or "wear [something] as blindfold" as blindfold-wearing. Blindfold-wearing is an action applying to one carried thing.

Check blindfold-wearing:
	try blindfolding the player with the noun instead.

Instead of attacking the Atlantida figure with something when the player does not wear a blinding thing:
	say "It's not sporting to strike the figure unless [you] [are] blindfolded; it's part of the rules. If no official blindfold is forthcoming, [you] might be able to make do by wearing some appropriate strip of cloth."
	
Carry out attacking the hanging Atlantida figure with something:
	remove the hanging Atlantida figure from play;

Report attacking the hanging Atlantida figure with something:
	say "[You] take a good swing with [the second noun] and connect, finally, with [the noun]. 

There is a resounding crack!

The crowd roars with approval, and dozens of small bodies surge around us so that I almost lose our balance. [You] push our [random blinding thing] up out of our way. 

The ground is covered with glitter and candy and confetti; the Atlantida has broken open at the torso.";
	now every blinding thing is not blinding;
	stop the action.



Section 7 - Fireworks

Fireworks is a scene. Fireworks begins when Pinata Celebration has ended and the time since Pinata Celebration ended is 2 minutes. Fireworks ends when the number of filled rows in the Table of Pyrotechnics is 0. 

[Instead of going to a room during Fireworks:
	say "[You] [are] relishing the not moving for a moment."]

When Fireworks begins:
	now the firework display is part of the sky;
	[if the player can see the sky:
		say "The sky cracks with a tremendous boom, and you register a flash of golden fire overhead.";
	otherwise:
		say "There is a huge distant noise. Something is happening to the sky.";
	say "Slango tooks one look at us and wraps us in a blanket. 'Stay here,' he says firmly. ";
	if the player encloses the rock or the roc is visible:
		now Brock is in Brock's Stateroom;
		now the rock is in the repository;
		now the roc is in the repository;
		say "He gels Brock back into existence and the two of them walk away.";
	otherwise:
		say "He walks away. A moment later, the ship engines start up.";
	now Slango is in the command chair;
	now Slango is seated.]
	
	
	
Every turn during Fireworks:
	repeat through the Table of Pyrotechnics: 
		if the player can see the sky:
			say "[description entry][paragraph break]";
		otherwise:
			say "[noise entry][paragraph break]";
		blank out the whole row;
		make no decision;

description	noise
"A silver rocket shoots up into the sky and bursts into a dozen tiny pinwheels like floating silver asterisks."	"There is a long whistle, a peppery burst. The fireworks must have started outside."
"Four red jets of fire appear over the old city turret. They shape into a cloud of red smoke, curling into very plausible quotation marks before dissipating."	"There is a distant roar like a hissing dragon."
"A thousand tiny golden double-dagger symbols material[ize] like stars and wink out."	"It sounds as though the sky is making popcorn."
"A delicate green flame leaps into the darkness and [--] elegant as a swimming fish [--] chases its own tail to form an @ overhead."	"The sky is temporarily very quiet."
"Something booms in the old city turret [--] something shot out of the deplural[izing] cannon! But it is not deplural[izing] shot. It is a ball of fire that arcs out over the harbor. At the height of its parabola it fragments and forms a gorgeous blue seriffed A over the water. The symbol and flag of Anglophone Atlantis."	"There is a deep boom of cannon fire."
	
Instead of examining the sky when firework display is part of the sky:
	say "Over the island, the fireworks are shooting off from the old city walls, in hon[our] of Serial Comma Day."

The firework display is a distant thing. The description is "The end of the last burst is fizzing into nothingness." Understand "fireworks" or "rockets" or "rocket" or "fire" or "flame" or "symbols" as the firework display.

 


Section 8 - Tracking Down Brock

Seeking Brock is a scene. Seeking Brock begins when Seeking invite ends. Seeking Brock ends when cold dilemma ends.

When Seeking Brock ends:
	now the current daytime is evening;
	remove the sun from play;
	
Section 9 - Escape
	
Landing is a scene. Landing begins when Seeking Brock ends. Landing ends when the location is nautical.

Definition: a thing is unoriginal if it is not original.

When Landing ends:
	if Brock is in the repository and something (called b-target) is proffered by Brock:

'This isn't working,' he remarks, tossing the gel and washcloth aside.

'We're fused,' [you] explain, not very coherently. 'Something happened. I don't know if it can be fixed.'[line break]";
	if Brock is in the repository:
		say "Brock looks at us for a long moment and then turns away. He vanishes into the galley.

'I'm sure he's just gone to get you a cup of tea,' Slango says. He takes a deep breath, stands. 'The T-inserter specs better be worth what Brock says they are.'[line break]";
	otherwise:
		say "'And Brock?' Slango demands. 'Have you got him?'

[You] shake our head. 'But he'll be released soon,' [you] say. 'I'm pretty sure I've seen to that.'

'Pretty sure,' Slango repeats.

[You] just look at him.

'Okay,' he says, though it isn't. 'Okay.' And he goes to the cockpit and fires up the engine, while we watch the lights of Atlantis get farther away and finally dim.";
	now Slango is not alert;
	now Brock is not alert; [we don't want them both asking questions constantly]

Rule for writing a topic sentence about the newspaper when the newspaper is on the built-in table:

Understand "paper" as the newspaper.

The description of the newspaper is "It's the Chard-Farmer's Daily from Atlantis. A huge headline is splashed across the front: 

'REFERENDUM ANNOUNCED!' 

The picture on the front shows the Atlantida statue decked out with lights like a Christmas tree and people posing next to her for pictures. 

My father has been promoted, apparently, to something called the Provisional Committee for Orthographic Reform. He is quoted as saying that the amnesty for Cold Storage prisoners is an important step forward. 'Of course, government by citizen referendum brings its own problems, and further constitutional work may be needed if we mean to bring Atlantis in line with the European Union.'"

Section 10 - Goodbye

[Writing the end of this game was insanely hard and went through many revisions and even arguments. Originally the game was quite a bit shorter, didn't include the Atlantida confrontation, and did end with the characters returning to the yacht and successfully gelling themselves into two people. But that felt wrong and disappointing, because it meant that the characters winning the game were neither of them the person you'd played.

Then I tried a variation where you only realize Alexandra is fused at the very end, when trying to put on the gel and having it not work. That solved one problem, but introduced another. There was no fictive explanation for what had happened; and it felt like a cliff-hanger, like it was setting up for one or more sequels in which Alexandra runs around the Mediterranean stealing stuff and looking for a tool that can de-synthesize her. Very briefly I was even delusional enough to think such sequels could happen. Then I considered the fate of every series ever, and discarded that idea. I needed this game to work on its own.

Next up I added the choice where the player had to gel Brock or betray Alex's father, and that provided a fictive explanation for the fusion, but it was still weird having the results of the fusion explained only in the last move of the game. When the Atlantida scene came in, though, I realized I could incorporate that discovery into the action of her scene. Much better.  

But we were not home free even when the endgame took on its current form. Graham argued that it should have an essentially happy ending: this is mostly an upbeat game, and the player has come through a lot and deserves a reward. I mostly agreed with this, especially when replaying it after some period away from the game. And Sam thought the rest of the game didn't really provide enough Alex v. Andra conflict to make that a major point of the ending. One of my testers, and I fear I can't remember who, said, 'look, this whole thing is basically a superhero origin story.' And at the end of a superhero origin story, the superhero is supposed to fire up her jet boots and fly off to the next world-saving adventure, right? So that made a lot of votes for putting a big smily face on the epilogue.

And yet. And yet. There are so many things that I felt were emotional loose ends, and it would be untruthful to just pretend they were fine. Alex and Andra are stuck with one another now, and while they may eventually work that out, it's got to be incredibly confusing and traumatic, especially given that they have different goals in life and that Alex, having been a straight cis-gendered male all his life, is not going to feel sexually at home in Alexandra's body. There's some possibility that they might be able to use linguistic tools to alter their gender back and forth if need be, but they're still going to be time-sharing in different bodies, rather than each having the one he or she would prefer. 

What about Brock? Can he and Andra continue their relationship in some format, or is it just too weird now? Isn't any sexual experience involving Alexandra going to be effectively a threesome, and are all three of them okay with that?

Then there's the question of what's just happened. Brock and Andra successfully pulled off a big heist; do we morally approve? And Alex's utopian linguistic plans are very optimistic but full of issues when it comes to real-world application.

Finally what about Atlantida's replacement (assuming the player went that way)? Even if there's a new system that allows more frequent referenda, direct democracy of that kind tends to be pretty conservative. Most likely more major change is still needed.

So that's all a lot to worry about, some of it far too complex to wrap in a single scene. And then on top of that I wanted to do something that honored the choices that the player had made in the last portion of the game: it should matter to the ending whether we did or did not leave Brock behind, did or did not kiss him in the room with the T-inserter, did or did not replace Atlantida.

Finally, I knew that I did *not* want this to be an epilogue with puzzles. The puzzles should be over when the player finally reaches the yacht.

So then we had several drafts where the epilogue is that Brock effectively breaks up with Andra and Alex and Andra muse on how they're stuck with each other. These were gloomy! Then there was a try where Brock and Alexandra have a fairly enigmatic, truce-forming sort of conversation and then drive off into the waves. This was not very satisfying either.

Ultimately, I decided to back-load as ruthlessly as I could. Wherever possible, I took hints of future ambiguities or problems (how workable is Alex's plan? can it be afforded? would it wipe out or replace local cultures? would it be remotely welcomed by the people there? etc.) and moved them back into the main body of the game somewhere. Likewise, I dealt more extensively with Andra's sexual memories of Brock in order to set up that Alex is a bit uncomfortable with them, while trying to establish that Brock is a fairly patient guy who has already stuck with Andra through some sexual weirdness and might be willing to do so again, under the right circumstances.]

Farewell is a scene. Farewell begins when Landing ends. 

Sanity-check going to the galley during Farewell:
	unless the player is wearing something which covers the legs-area:
		say "How about we put on some pants first?" instead;
	unless the player is wearing something which covers the torso-area:
		say "We should really be wearing something on top, don't you think?" instead.
		
Sanity-check taking off something which covers the legs-area during Farewell:
	unless the player is in your bunk or the player is in your head:
		say "I'd rather not disrobe in public. And this may not be public to you, but it is to me." instead.
		
Sanity-check taking off something which covers the torso-area during Farewell:
	unless the player is in your bunk or the player is in your head:
		say "I'd rather not disrobe in public. And this may not be public to you, but it is to me." instead.
	
When Farewell begins: remove Brock from play.

A ranking rule for Brock when Farewell is happening:
	decrease the description-rank of Brock by 100. 

Farewell ends when the newspaper is examined.

When Farewell ends:
	if atlantida-refreshed is seen:
	   	if library message person is first person:
			say "[betrayed-outcome]";
		otherwise:
			say "[unbetrayed-outcome]"; 
	else:
	   	say "[no-atlantida-outcome]";  
	if the new church is not visited:
		record "Priscilla Parsons award for winning the game without ever entering the church" as an achievement;
	if hardness is true:
		record "Andra award for completing the game in hard mode" as an achievement;
	else:
		record "Alex Rosehip award for completing the game in easy mode" as an achievement;  
	end the story finally saying "The End";


To say no-atlantida-outcome:
	say "Brock comes down and hands us a coffee. You look like you could use this. We've hit Mallorca,' he says. 'Slango's in town resupplying.'

[You] nod.

'And the payment for our exploit is still coming through to the Swiss accounts, but we'll be millionaires.'

'All of us?'

'Well. Each of us, individually and severally.' He tips his head back and considers us. 'That may well be one of the most valuable technical heists in history, and you got a grand tour of the secret Atlantean bunker while you were at it. I'm only sorry I wasn't awake for that part.'

I know, me, that we could have done something more. That we could have left Atlantis with a new leader, one who'd open things up again. This way, there'll just be a bunch of infighting but the Bureau will remain how it always was. I wish— 

You've pretty much stopped listening to me entirely, haven't you? And so I'm stuck here, just watching, while you pitch my flash drive and my monocle in a corner, and plot the fastest course to Portofino.

Still. I don't feel as homesick as I thought I would, because the one thing you can give me is this: you know how to put something behind you.".


To say unbetrayed-outcome:
	say "Brock comes down and hands us a coffee. 'You look like you could use this. We've hit Mallorca,' he says. 'Slango's in town resupplying. I guess you saw the paper?'

[You] nod. 

'One for the history books,' he says, with a crooked smile. 'They're showing satellite clips. Big olive garland on the depluralizing tank. People dancing on cars. Some old guy belting out La Marseillaise in the Bureau Rotunda.'

Brock sits down opposite us. 'In other news,' he remarks, 'it looks like your cut of the T-remover plans, with all the tests we ran, is going to come out to this.' He writes a number. The number has six zeroes. 

He leans back and looks at us.

'So. Where do we go from here?'" 


To say betrayed-outcome:
	say "Slango comes in, with Brock behind him. 'Bad news,' he says. 'We're going to have to split that payout three ways instead of two. The new Atlantida has a perverse sense of humor. She express-mailed Brock to Mallorca for us. In rock form.'

Brock bends down to massage his right thigh. 'Turns out it's not comfortable having spent the night in a cardboard box, even if you were petrified at the time. Things to know and learn.'

[You] study his face. It's the face he wears when he's reserving judgment about whether or not to be incredibly pissed off. You're the one who knows how to read that face, but I'm a little relieved to see it too.

'My father might've been inanimated instead,' I say.

'Slango mentioned,' Brock says. 

'He's a lot older. I thought he might have some heart trouble or... or not deal with it well.'

Brock studies us for a moment more. Then he reaches into his pocket and pulls out a huge gummy candy shaped like a squid. 

'Want one? They used them as packing material in my shipping box. We've got lots.'"
	 

	


Volume 2 - The World

Book 1 - Act I Among Sightseers

Part 1 - Tutorial

Chapter 1 - Barriers and Spaces

[Because the temporary barrier is the first real puzzle the player faces, it is especially important to handle all attempts at interaction as clearly as possible. In addition, the point of the puzzle is to figure out how to get the code, not to make the player do fiddly things -- so anything that could reasonably be construed as an attempt to use the code once it's been discovered should be redirected towards opening.]

The temporary barrier is south of Fair. The temporary barrier is a door. It is transparent, closed and locked. "[A temporary barrier] blocks [if the location is the Fair]this noisy fair from the empty street to the south[otherwise]this empty street from the busy fair to the north[end if][if the temporary barrier is locked], though there is a door that could be opened with the correct code[otherwise], though it is currently unlocked and anyone could go through[end if][if the location is Ampersand Bend]. From here the gaiety and excitement of the holiday are fairly loud[end if]."  

The description of the temporary barrier is "It's a high metal fence, supported by sturdy poles. It's designed to contain the chaos a little, and keep people who have come in for the Fair from wandering off down the side streets and causing trouble in unpoliced areas of town. It has [a code-lock] that opens the inset door."

Instead of looking under the temporary barrier:
	say "[The temporary barrier] is set flush with the ground. There is certainly not enough room to crawl underneath."

Instead of climbing the temporary barrier:
	say "The links of the fence are too close to offer easy purchase for feet, and the fence is high and barbed on top. They really don't want anyone coming through uninvited."
	
Instead of pulling or pushing or turning or attacking the temporary barrier: 
	say "It rattles a little, but is basically far too sturdy for us to take down."
	
Instead of touching the temporary barrier:
	say "It's sturdy [--] though not electrified, if that's what you were thinking."

A description-concealing rule when the temporary barrier is marked for listing:
	if the location is the Fair and the temporary barrier is open, now the temporary barrier is not marked for listing.

Sanity-check unlocking the temporary barrier with something:
	if the code is visible:
		try setting the code-lock to "code" instead;
	say "[The temporary barrier] is locked. [You][']d need to set the code-lock to the right number." instead.

Sanity-check unlocking keylessly the temporary barrier:
	if the code is visible:
		try setting the code-lock to "code" instead;
	say "[The temporary barrier] is locked. [You][']d need to set the code-lock to the right number." instead.

Sanity-check locking the temporary barrier with something:
	if the code is visible:
		try setting the code-lock to "333" instead;
	say "[You][']d need to set [the code-lock] to some random number." instead.

Sanity-check locking keylessly the temporary barrier:

Ampersand Bend is south of the temporary barrier. It is a road. "A bend in the street, which runs west and north. This district combines the old and the new: a small [museum] in an ancient stone building to the east, a shiny [real estate office] south. The window of the museum is currently displaying one of its exhibits, [a list of things on the display stand][if the code is on the display stand]. Well, not to worry: they'll be able to restore the codex easily enough when the museum reopens[end if]." Understand "district" as Ampersand Bend.

At that time, the name-driven nature of the universe was not yet understood, but some consciousness of it wiggled towards the surface like a breaking tooth. The lunatics were first to notice. 

I've visited this museum before and seen the inside, by the way. Many of the pages are filled with what [you] would now consider rather elementary rebus puzzles."

Instead of taking the codex:
	say "Even if [you] could reach, there's not much point in such a theft."

I can tell you find all that shockingly overpriced, but trust me: land is scarce on this island and there are a lot of people who want to own it, not just locals but international corporations.[or][stopping]".

Instead of going south in Ampersand Bend:
	say "That way lies a real estate office closed for Serial Comma Day. [run paragraph on]";

Some elderly apartments are scenery in Sigil Street. The description is "From down here [you] can only see the shuttered windows and the occasional balcony or awning, but you can guess what they're probably like from the environment: old-fashioned inside, kitchens and bathrooms awkwardly fitted into niches and closets of buildings that weren't designed for plumbing. But they're also probably rather [if the player wears the Britishizing goggles]cosy[otherwise]cozy[end if] and handsome, with exposed beams under the ceiling." Understand "flat" or "apartment" or "apartment" or "building" or "buildings" as the elderly apartments.

The reflective window is a fixed in place mirror in Sigil Street.

The description of the typographer's office is "The office advertises custom fonts and symbols, though it is very unlikely that anyone decides to have a custom font made simply because they happened to catch a notice in a shop window. In hon[our] of the holiday, there is also a display poster showing the form of the humble comma as it manifests itself in a variety of popular fonts."

Instead of looking toward Back Alley:
	say "It doesn't look like there's anything interesting back that way."

Back Alley is south of Sigil Street. It is a road. "[one of]This isn't much, is it?

Part 2 - Old Town Celebration

Chapter 1 - Central Park Area

Section 1 - The Park

Park Center is a room. The description of the Park Center is "This is a handsome expanse of [grass], shaped like a rectangle with rounds cut from the corners, bounded by [railings] along the north side. There are no stalls and no barkers here, but [small children] are running around [if the horses are part of the fountain]an impressive[else]a desecrated[end if] [marble fountain][if hoses are part of the marble fountain], currently spewing water in all directions[end if].[one of]

I gather from the direction of your thoughts that you dislike small children, so I'll restrain myself from trying to communicate with them.[or][stopping]".

Some railings are a facade. Understand "railing" as the railings. They are scenery in Park Center. They front north. The description is "Painted railings separate the Park and surrounding pedestrian areas from the private property to the north. Some [lipstick advertisements] have been hung over the railings." Understand "painted" as the railings.
	The closure notice is "There is no gate in the railings at this point. ".
	
Check waving the letter-remover at the railings when the current setting of the letter-remover is "s":
	say "The letter-remover warms in our hand, but nothing visibly changes, perhaps because RAILING lies on the awkward verge between a count noun and a mass noun, and if we say RAILINGS we mean something not very different from A QUANTITY OF RAILING, making RAILING a word with cumulative reference." instead

	
Some lipstick advertisements are part of the railings.
	Understand "ad" or "ads" or "advert" or "adverts" as the lipstick advertisements.
	The description of the lipstick advertisements is "Over the image of a pouting, lipsticked female, it says: IN EVERY TEMPTRESS THERE IS AN EMPRESS [--] MAKE YOURSELF UP TO A T! It's selling Temptress Brand cosmetics, apparently.".

Rule for listing exits when looking in Park Center:
	do nothing instead.
	
Rule for distantly describing Park Center:
	say "That way is the cen[ter] of the park, across a lot of grass."
	
[Before printing the name of a direction (called way) while listing exits:
	if the player is in Park Center, say "[room way from the location] to the "

Procedural rule when listing exits:
	if the location is Park Center, ignore the append room names rule.

Rule for listing exits when looking in Park Center:
	do nothing instead. ]
	

Check waving the letter-remover at the small children when the current setting of the letter-remover is "s":
	say "If it were a more powerful device, the letter-remover might be able to generate something resembling the concept of 'mall children,' but that's not an idiomatic saying around here. Not to mention that the parents would be bound to object." instead

Carry out examining small children:
	trigger Childhood-bedroom.

Some small children are a person in Park Center. Understand "child" or "boy" or "girl" or "sibling" as the small children. The description is "They look small and harmless, but you're probably right that they have sticky hands." The children are scenery.

Every turn when the small children can see the hoses and the location is Park Center:
	if a random chance of 1 in 2 succeeds:
		say "[one of]A little boy[or]A small girl[at random] [one of]tries to catch the spraying hosewater in an open mouth[or]pushes a sibling into the path of the water[or]leaps gleefully through the arc of water[at random].";
		change the description of the small children to "Most of them are now sopping wet, and loving it.";
		if a random chance of 1 in 5 succeeds:
			say "[line break]A harrassed-looking All-Purpose Officer comes hurrying across the lawn towards the vandal[ize]d fountain. For a moment it looks like she might get close enough to spot us, but about twenty paces off she stops, plants her feet, and gets out a restoration-gel rifle.
			
There's a bang, a last glittering fan of water in the air.[paragraph break]";
			gel-convert the hoses;
			say "[line break]As for the Officer, she's already speaking into her radio as she turns away.".
		
Every turn when the small children can see the ho and the location is Park Center:
	say "It isn't but a few seconds before a watchful parent notices the ho strutting around and goes to report her. 

She is too stupid — as a constructed person — to put up much resistance when an officer shows up to escort her away.";
	remove the ho from play.
		
[And now we need to special-case these, because otherwise they will fall on the ground. In general we want letter-conversion to move things that are part of other things, but here it's funnier and also more persuasive if the changed items stay part of the fountain.] 
To gel-convert (item - hoses): 
	now everything which proffers the item is part of the marble fountain;  
	now the item is in the repository;
	[play the sound of gel splort;] 
	say "[The item] become[s] [a list of things which proffer the item], redecorating the fountain.";
	repeat with secondary running through things which proffer the item:
		abide by the dangerous construction rules for the secondary.
To gel-convert (item - hoe): 
	now everything which proffers the item is part of the marble fountain; 
	now the item is in the repository;
	[play the sound of gel splort;] 
	say "[The item] become[s] [a list of things which proffer the item], redecorating the fountain.";
	repeat with secondary running through things which proffer the item:
		abide by the dangerous construction rules for the secondary.

Instead of taking the children:
	say "There's no need to attract attention to our new face with a kidnapping charge."

Instead of kissing the children:
	say "I doubt their mothers would approve."
	
Instead of saying hello to the children:
	say "[one of]They have probably been instructed not to talk to strangers[or]Come on, they're not in the least useful[stopping].". 

Instead of asking the children about something: 
	say "[one of]They have probably been instructed not to talk to strangers[or]Come on, they're not in the least useful[stopping].". 

Instead of telling the children about something: 
	say "None of them hold still long enough to listen."
	
[The fountain itself is similar to one in a plaza in Carcassonne. The horses-to-hoses business was a late-game addition, thanks to Jim Munroe trying to amuse the children.]

The marble fountain is a scenery container. It is in Park center. The description of the fountain is "[if horses are part of the marble fountain]It depicts some horses rising out of the waves, with trident-bearing gods on their backs, and some nymphs overseeing the whole operation. Probably 17th-century, to judge by the excessive number of writhing [figures][else if hoses are part of the marble fountain]The nymphs and trident-bearing gods are now aiming hoses out at passers-by[else if hoe is part of the marble fountain]A single bewildered nymph is carrying a hoe, which presumably isn't much use out at sea[else]The former majesty of the fountain has been extensively vandalized[end if]." 
	The introduction is "The fountain celebrates [--] if that's the right word [--] the conquest of this island by the Dutch in 1607, it having been a Spanish possession for about 140 years before that. 

In spite of this the fountain bears not a word of any foreign language, the original Latin or vernacular inscriptions having been long since renovated away."

Some horses are part of the marble fountain. Understand "horse" or "horse statues" or "horse sculptures" as the horses. The description of the horses is "Their eyes are wide and their nostrils flared with excitement."

Some sculpted figures are part of the fountain. The description of the sculpted figures is "Nereids and Tritons, apparently, together with tame fish, conch shells, and other representatives of the goods of the sea." Understand "nereids" or "tritons" or "fish" or "shells" or "goods of the sea" or "tame" or "conch" or "gods" or "trident-bearing" or "poseidon" or "neptune" or "nymphs" or "nymph" or "trident" or "god" as the figures.

Instead of searching the fountain:
	say "The basin is nearly full of clear [water], but there are no coins or other useful articles to be found. This is not a culture that tends to discard what might be of use."

The missing-inscriptions are part of the marble fountain. The printed name is "inscriptions". Understand "inscription" or "inscriptions" or "renovated" or "latin" or "vernacular" or "missing" or "nonexistent" or "non-existent" or "foreign" or "lettering" or "letters" or "words" or "language" or "original" as the missing-inscriptions.

The description of the missing-inscriptions is "Whatever writing once graced the fountain, it has been chiseled off because it wasn't in English."


Instead of listening to a room when in Open-Air:
	if hoses are part of the marble fountain:
		say "The sound of children shrieking and jumping through fountain water is by far the loudest component of the assorted din.";
	else:
		say "Children laughing and shouting, people selling food and drinks, various fairground machinery, tinny music, adult conversations, flowing water in the fountain."

After deciding the scope of the player when in Open-Air: 
	place the fountain in scope.
	
Rule for reaching inside a room: 
	if the person reaching is the player:
		say "[You] can only look from this distance."; 
	deny access.
	
The water is in the fountain. The water is fluid and scenery. 
	The indefinite article is "some".
	Understand "clear" as the water.
	Instead of taking the water, say "[You] can't, not having webbed fingers." 
	Instead of drinking the water, say "It might not be sanitary." 
	The scent-description of the water is "wet marble".

Some grass is scenery in the Park Center. The description is "Deep green and velvety."
	Instead of touching the grass: say "[You] kneel and run our fingers through the grass."
	Sanity-check digging in the grass:
		say "It must have taken years of careful upkeep to achieve the smoothness of the present turf. No point in ruining that now." instead.

Rule for distantly describing the Fair:
	say "That way is the fair: a mass of booths and people and games and bright sunlight, too chaotic to get a good look at from here."

The Fair is south of Park Center. "[one of]Today is Serial Comma Day, one of the biggest holidays on the island, and a time when half the police force is off duty while the other half is over-extended. The perfect day to make an escape. [or][stopping]The square at the cen[ter] of town is [one of]therefore [or][stopping]crowded with people, and there's an overpowering smell of artificial butter and spun sugar."

Instead of smelling the Fair:
	say "It smells like candy and popcorn, with a note of booze and another note of sweaty crowd."
	

The wheel is a thing in the Fair. The heft is 5. The description is "It's the sort of game where you spin the wheel for a prize[if the location is the Fair]. No one seems to be manning or using it any more, though; perhaps the supply of prizes has run out[end if]."

Instead of pushing or pulling the wheel:
	say "The wheel contraption moves a few millimeters to the side. Of course, we could always spin it and see what happens."

Instead of looking under the wheel:
	say "It looks heavy, but is not actually attached to the ground."

Instead of listening to the wheel:
	say "When the wheel is spinning, the flipper makes a satisfying [i]thup thup thup[/i] noise as it flips from one slot to the next."


Understand "use [wheel]" as turning.

Instead of turning the wheel:
	say "We give the wheel [one of]a[or]another[stopping] [one of]energetic[or]hard[or]strong[at random] spin. The pointer lands on [one of]HOT AIR[one of], which appears to be the most common reward[or] again[or] yet again[stopping][or]FREE POSTCARD[or]BLUE RASPBERRY LOLLIPOP[or]STUFFED DONKEY[or]STUFFED OCTOPUS[or]SET OF PAINT[or]LIFETIME CHARD SUPPLY[as decreasingly likely outcomes][one of]. Sadly, no one is around to award this prize (which is probably why we were allowed to spin it without having some sort of ticket first)[or]. Too bad no one is around to award the prize. Of course, if someone were, they'd be charging to spin[stopping]."

The random foodstuffs are scenery in the fair. Understand "spun" or "sugar" or "candy" or "butter" or "artificial" or "booze" or "popcorn" as the random foodstuffs. 
	The description is "An assortment of unwholesome things to eat are sold here, and since it's extremely hot, [you] smell all of them pungently and in rapid succession. If it's not my imagination, actually, I think this female nose is better than mine. (I've heard that women have a better sense of smell. This could be wrong.) At the moment that sensitivity is a liability, as disorienting as flashes of a col[our]ed strobe.".  [* I wanted to give the sense in the first portion of the game that Alex and Andra are really disoriented by what has happened to them. Some of their sensations are borrowed from what it's like to have a migraine on a hot, sunny day amid a crowd: everything is simply too present to endure, and smells and noises become distinct and offensive even if normally they'd be quite pleasant.]

Some kiosks are fixed in place things in the Fair.  The description of the kiosks is "They're the usual tacky affairs of brightly painted [if the player wears the Britishizing goggles]fibreboard[otherwise]fiberboard[end if] and cheap prizes. I don't see any likely to help us today, however." Understand "activity" or "activities" or "cheap" or "prizes" or "face-painting" or "face painting" or "spell offs" or "spell-offs" as the kiosks.


A ranking rule for the kiosks: increase description-rank of the kiosks by 50.

Definition: the kiosks are deeply dull:
	no.

Rule for writing a topic sentence about kiosks:
	say "[You] are surrounded by [kiosks] for spell-offs, face-painting[if the wheel is in the location], [a wheel] to spin for prizes[end if], and other activities best for small children or the very easily amused. [run paragraph on]";

Rule for listing exits when in Fair:
	if boldening is true:
		say "The Fair continues with a selection of carnival games to the [b]west[/b], and with open park to the [b]north[/b] and [b]east[/b].";
	else:
		say "The Fair continues with a selection of carnival games to the west, and with open park to the north and east."

Section 2 - Midway

The Midway is west of the Fair and southwest of Park Center. "Here in front of the [pharmacy] in the southwestern corner of the town square, various contests have been set up [--] a [strong-man contest], a contest to see who can burst the most [balloons] using [a styrofoam dart-plane], and so on."

The pharmacy is a facade in Midway. It fronts south. It is scenery. Understand "pharmacy" or "window" or "windows" or "glass" or "front" or "shade" or "shampoo" or "razors" or "analgesics" or "burn" or "creams" or "candy" or "toothpaste" or "homeopathic" or "remedies" as the pharmacy. The description is "There's not much to see, as a shade has been pulled down behind the glass front. I can tell you what's back there, though, if you care: the usual assortment of shampoo and razors and analgesics and burn creams; candy, and also toothpaste; and a costly selection of homeopathic remedies in matching brown bottles."

The blank church wall is a facade in Midway. It fronts west. It is scenery. The description is "The blank wall separates off the church property that lies west of here."
	The closure notice is "The wall is solid here, though the church can be entered from the church forecourt. ".

Instead of going south in Midway:
	say "The pharmacy, like many of the other shops in the area, is closed so that the employees can enjoy Serial Comma Day. [run paragraph on]";
	carry out the listing exits activity.

Rule for listing exits while looking in Midway:
	do nothing instead.

The strong-man hammering contest is scenery in the Midway. Understand "strongman" or "bell" or "bells" or "hammer" as the contest. The description is "It's one of those contests where you have to hammer something so that something else flies up and rings a bell. I don't have time for that kind of silly macho display."

The balloons are scenery in the Midway. The description is "All stapled in place and ready to be attacked." Instead of attacking the balloons: say "[one of]Better to leave that nonsense to the little ones.[or]Come on, we'll never get away if you insist on lollygagging![or]We have better things to do, remember?[stopping]".

The styrofoam dart-plane is scenery in the Midway. The description is "Ridiculous little styrofoam gliders with dart-noses. No use to us, anyway."

The word-balance is fixed in place in the Midway. Understand "balance" or "steel" or "scales" or "pair of" or "beam" or "fabulous" as the word-balance. The printed name is "word-balance". "[if the barker is visible]I assume you've noticed, though, [otherwise]No longer so useful is [end if]the [word-balance], which comes up as high as our hip. [balance contents]". The description is "The beam is [if the word-balance is tilting]tilting[otherwise]balanced[end if]. [balance contents]".

Instead of touching, pushing, pulling, or turning the word-balance: 
	try pushing the right pan.

Instead of inserting something into the word-balance:
	say "You'd have to be specific about which pan you mean."

Instead of putting something on the word-balance:

Understand "put [word-balance] out of alignment" or "unbalance [word-balance]" or "win [tube]" or "try hand" or "try my/our hand" or "try hand at [word-balance]" or "try my/our hand at [word-balance]" as a mistake ("[one of]That does seem like the general idea.[or]Could you be a little clearer about the strategy?[or]I don't see how to carry out that clever little plan.[stopping]").

A ranking rule for the word-balance: increase description-rank of the word-balance by 50.

Every turn when a fluid thing (called target) is in a pan:
	unless the target is contained:
		move the target to the location;
		say "[The target] runs rapidly out through the slots of the pan."
	
Every turn: 
	if the word-balance is tilting and the barker is visible
	begin;
		[follow the considerate player's holdall rule;]
		move the tube to the player;
		move the barker to the repository;
		say "There is a [if the ear is in a pan]disgusted gasp[otherwise]cheer[end if] from the spectators. [The word-balance] tilts slowly but inexorably.
		
[The barker] looks astonished and displeased, except for a fraction of a second when he just noticeably winks. With exaggerated bad grace hands us [a gel]. 'There's your prize. And now this contest is over.'

He stalks away";
		[if the apple is in a pan
		begin;
			move the apple to the repository;
			say ", taking [the apple] with him";
		end if;]
		say ".";
		record "winning the gel" as achieved;
		if the barker is the current interlocutor, change the current interlocutor to nothing;
	end if;

To say balance contents:

	begin;
		if the left pan does not contain something, say "Both pans are empty. ";
		otherwise say "The right pan is empty and the left contains [a list of things in the left pan]. ";

	end if.

A pan is a kind of container. Understand "scale" or "pan" or "pans" as a pan. The right pan and the left pan are pans. The left pan and the right pan are part of the word-balance. The description of a pan is "Sturdy but slotted."

Instead of putting something on a pan, try inserting the noun into the second noun.

An apple is a vegetable. The apple is edible. 

In the right pan is an apple. In the left pan is a pear. The pear is edible. 

The description of an apple is "Red-cheeked and rosy." The scent-description of an apple is "apple juice". The flavor-description of an apple is "The skin tastes slightly waxy: I suspect it's been gussied up to look nice."

The description of the pear is "Handsome and green." 
	The flavor-description of the pear is "The flesh is not quite ripe and tastes wooden."

Instead of smelling the pear:
	say "It doesn't smell like much of anything, probably because it's not completely ripe yet."

The pear is a vegetable.

Report waving the letter-remover at the apple creating ale:
	say "There's a smell of fermenting apple, then cider, then something more malty. In the apple's place there is now a glass of nutbrown ale." instead.

Understand "put [something preferably held] on/onto [a pan]" as inserting it into.

Instead of taking something which is in a pan in the presence of the barker: 
	say barker-refusal instead.
	
Instead of touching or pushing or pulling or turning a pan in the presence of the barker: say barker-refusal instead.

Instead of touching or pushing or pulling or turning something which is in a pan in the presence of the barker: say barker-refusal instead.

To say barker-refusal:
	say "[one of]'None of that!' says [the barker]. 'You must make one side go down and the other come up, but you may not add or subtract anything from the load, you may not apply pressure to the beam itself, and you may not lean on, push, pull, or support the individual pans!'

A little boy in the crowd snickers rudely. 'Got ya!'[or]The barker gives us a warning look. In case you forgot, we may not increase or decrease the contents of the pan by hand or lean on the beam.[or]It is against the rules of the contest to remove something from the pans; and whatever we do, we've got to do without touching.[stopping]";  
	
The barker is a man in the Midway. "Beside the word-balance is a barker in [a blue suit], the same regulation blue used by the Bureau of Orthography." The barker wears a blue suit.

Instead of asking someone about something:
	say "[The noun] thinks for a moment, then apparently decides not to answer."

Definition: the word-balance is tilting if the total heft of the things in the left pan is not the total heft of the things in the right pan.

Every turn when the barker is visible and the word-balance is not tilting:
	add barker-advertisement to the planned conversation of the barker.
	
Check someone who is not the current interlocutor discussing an NPC-directed quip:
	set the current interlocutor to the actor.
	
barker-advertisement is an NPC-directed quip.
	The response is "[one of]'Step up and try your hand at the fabulous word-balance!' calls the barker appealingly.[or]'Put the beam out of alignment and win a fabulous prize!' says the barker, holding up a [tube].[or]'One [tube] of restoration gel goes to the first person who can unbalance the word-balance!' cries the barker, glance sweeping the crowd.[at random]".

The barker is carrying a tube. The description of the tube is "It claims to be full of restoration gel, but said gel has mostly gone. If only it had been a larger container to start with." Understand "gel" or "prize" or "fabulous prize" or "label" or "restoration gel" as the tube. The scent-description of the tube is "mint". The tube is essential.

	say "The barker spots us gesticulating and smoothly, almost without thinking about it, swaps the tube into the other hand so that [you] miss."

Instead of examining the tube when the tube is carried by the barker:
	say "[You] can't get a good look at the tube from this position, but it definitely appears to be authentic restoration gel [--] valuable stuff, I recall you saying. [one of](Or were you just trying to impress me?)[or][stopping]".

Understand "rub [tube] on/onto/over/into/to [something]" as a mistake ("[if the barker carries the gel]You don't have the gel at the moment[otherwise]There isn't enough gel remaining in the little tube for use[end if].").

Understand "put [tube] on/onto/over/to [something]" as a mistake ("[if the barker carries the gel]You don't have the gel at the moment[otherwise]There isn't enough gel remaining in the little tube for use[end if].")

Rule for listing exits when looking in Postcard Stalls: do nothing.

]

[Northwest of the Park Center is the Food Corner. 

The description of the Food Corner is "In this corner of the park, a sausage stand has been set up. This is partly for the benefit of the people enjoying the park and partly for the patrons of the cinema to the north, which has no food counter of its own."

The sausage stand is scenery in Food Corner. "An ingenious invention able to keep several dozen Italian sausages, bratwurst, and Kosher hot dogs simultaneously at the ideal heat for serving."

The sausage-seller is a man in Food Corner. The description of the sausage-seller is "He looks suspicious [--] I mean, he looks as though he suspects us of something. It's true that I passed him earlier a few times when I came up here to stash my things before our operation. I even contemplated buying a Kosher hot dog from him, and changed my mind at the last minute because I was afraid of missing our appointment.

But since I was a tall blond male at the time, I don't think he can remember the incident."
	Understand "sausage" or "seller" or "man" as the sausage-seller.]

Section 3 - Church Forecourt

The Church Forecourt is [south of Food Corner,] northwest of Fair, west of Park Center, [southwest of Postcard Stalls,] and north of Midway.

	if the player is in New Church:
		say "It is much brighter out there in the Church Forecourt.";

[Some salespeople are an alert person in Church Forecourt. The description is "They are all male, somewhat scruffily dressed in bright-colored clothing. This is amateur hour: the real smugglers and counterfeiters and inventors, the [i]pidgitiers[/i], work down by the docks, or in concealed places around town; when you see them out of doors they are always respectable, and their wares are proof against authentication scopes."
	The initial appearance is "Several enterprising salespeople have set out [blankets] on the sidewalk and are hawking wares almost guaranteed to be linguistic counterfeits."
	[The introduction is "The salespeople are particularly daring because they are only a few hundred feet from the front door of the Rotunda. Nonetheless, no one has the right to arrest these characters except a special branch of the police, the black-caped Authenticators. The Authenticators ride around the city [--] slowly [--] on horseback. Notably, they never speed up enough to outpace the lookouts."]
	
Report the salespeople saying hello to the player:
	say "[one of]'Buy a nice [random thing which is on the blankets]?' wheedles one of the salespeople. I fix them with a practiced cold stare.[or]'Bargains,' says one of the salespeople in a dull voice.[or][one of]The salespeople, recognizing us again, do not bother with another sales pitch.[or]There is a perfunctory nod from the salespeople.[or]The salespeople acknowledge us with a small nod.[at random][stopping]" instead.

The blankets are a supporter in the Market. The description is "Synthetic fleece, grubby from being spread on many sidewalks." Understand "blanket" or "cloth" as the blankets. The scent-description is "hot polyester".

The church exterior is a facade in Church Forecourt. Understand "new church" or "plaster" or "entrance" or "entry" or "flank" or "building" or "flank of the building" as the church exterior. The printed name is "New Church". 
	"This corner of the park, in the lee of the church, has been left free of kiosks and booths. Contrary to the usual rules of cathedral layout, the [church exterior] is oriented toward the north, so [you] are standing by the flank of the building, though there is an entrance on this side."
	The description is "It manages to be austere without seeming in the least modern: the walls are white and the windows clear, but the proportions, the texture of the plaster, the irregular leading between the panes of glass, all come of the age of handmade things."
	
Instead of touching the church exterior:
	say "We rest our spread palm on the wall of the church. It is reassuringly solid."

Some clear windows are part of the church exterior. Understand "panes" or "glass" or "leading" or "irregular" as the clear windows.
	The description is "They reflect the lucid blue of the sky."

	else:
		say "South and east lead to more of the park; there is a small [cinema-exterior][if the backpack is not handled] (where I left my pack)[end if] to the north, and the entrance to the [church exterior] is west.";

No, there aren't any here [i]now[/i]. But trust me. It's an unforgettable sight[or][stopping]."

Rule for distantly describing Heritage Corner:
	say "That way is the bricked-over portion of the town square, sometimes used for exhibitions of regional dance. Today it is less populated than most of the Square[if the location is the Fair]. Beyond Heritage Corner to the east is the hostel where you stowed some important gear[end if]."
	
A diorama table is fixed in place in Heritage Corner. It is a supporter. "Under a bit of [diorama-shelter] in the corner, [a diorama table] shows scenes from local history, rotated out each week.

Both army and members are missing[otherwise if the army is not on the diorama table]. The army has been removed[otherwise if the members are not on the diorama table and the member is on the diorama table].

An army is a thing on the diorama table. The description of the army is "A collection of soldier figurines in blue uniforms."

A description-concealing rule:
	if the army is on the diorama table:
		now the army is not marked for listing;
	if the members are on the diorama table:
		now the members are not marked for listing.
		
Definition: a thing is diorama-appropriate:
	if it is the member:
		yes;
	if it is the members:

Chapter 2 - Indoor Areas

Section 1 - Cinema
 

The Cinema Lobby is north of Church Forecourt. It is indoors. "This is a small, one-screen theater. [one of]The seats are not comfortable and the screen is not large. The projector is old. The management is lazy. No food is served. 

On two occasions, the film I was watching burst into flames while it was being shown.

Despite these handicaps, it maintains an active and interested clientele simply by virtue of content: a wide variety of foreign films that, though meticulously dubbed into flawless California-accented English, nonetheless carry that slight tang of the forbidden.

[or][stopping]Evidently the next showing is not for a little while yet, because there are no patrons in sight."

Instead of going in when in Cinema Lobby:
	try going west.

Rule for listing exits when in Cinema Lobby:
	if looking, do nothing;
	otherwise say "There is of course the exit to the south; the screening room itself is west."

	The description of the ticket-taker is "Not one of this country's best and brightest, but he seems good-natured."
	Understand "young" or "man" or "ticket taker" or "taker" as the ticket-taker. 

Rule for writing a paragraph about the ticket-taker when the ticket-taker is not the current interlocutor:

	otherwise say "'Ticket,' says the [ticket-taker] automatically.";
	have the parser notice the ticket-taker;
	now everything held by the ticket-taker is mentioned.
 

Instead of going to the Screening Room when the ticket-taker does not know allowed-in-movie:
	carry out the describing path activity with the player;
	if the ticket-taker is not in the location, continue the action;
	set the current interlocutor to the ticket-taker;
	queue hang-on-there.

The Screening Room is west of Cinema Lobby. It is indoors. "[if the player recollects what the movie seems]'Red'[otherwise]Whatever is scheduled for later showing[end if] has not started yet, and is probably not destined to start for some time; at any rate,[unless the project is switched on] the [film screen] is blank and[end if] no audience has yet assembled."

Instead of waiting in the Screening Room:
	if the reel is in the projector and the projector is switched on:
		make no decision;
	say "[one of]A little time passes, but I don't think the movie's likely to start for quite some time.[or][You] haven't got time to wait for the show to begin.[stopping]".

The description is "[if the reel is in the projector and the projector is switched on]The screen flickers black and white[otherwise if the projector is switched on]The white beam from the projector illuminates it, but no movie is showing[otherwise]The screen is empty: nothing is yet being shown. It is also very very small by modern cinema standards[end if]."

The seats are an enterable supporter in the Screening Room. The seats are scenery. The description is "In an age of stadium seating and theater chairs that resemble home recliners, these don't even have the usual old-fashioned red plush. They are hard wooden seats such as might be found in a puritanical schoolroom." Understand "row" or "rows" or "seat" or "seating" or "chairs" or "chair" as the seats. 
	Instead of looking under the seats when the backpack is in the Screening Room:

The backpack is in the Screening Room. "My [backpack] is stowed under a seat in the third row from the back." Understand "pack" or "rucksack" or "backsack" as the backpack.
	The backpack is wearable and essential. 
	It covers the torso-area.
	The introduction of the backpack is "I figured that it would be undisturbed there for a couple of hours, in the dark and out of sight, and if anyone found it they would probably turn it in to Lost and Found. But it is a big relief to find it still there."

The backpack is a player's holdall. The description of the backpack is "Mine: a little bit worn, but capacious. It doesn't have any identifying marks on it, and I thought a brand-new bag would look more suspicious[if the backpack is open]. It currently gapes open[else]. It's closed[end if]." The backpack is openable and closed and transparent. 

The backpack contains a flash drive. The description of the flash drive is "This is it: all my notes; the syllable-and word-generating programs from which I built my language vocabulary; the lexicon and pronunciation guide and grammatical descriptions.

And then there's the research to support the product: citations; copies of journal articles and scans from books; contact information for people in the outside world I think could help me.

It's everything I've been working on for the last three years."

Carry out taking the flash drive:
	complete "Get my backpack from the cinema";
	record "retrieving the backpack" as achieved.
	
Carry out taking something which encloses the flash drive:
	complete "Get my backpack from the cinema";
	record "retrieving the backpack" as achieved.

The flash drive is essential.

[ The projection booth is here chiefly for easter egg purposes: if the player (much later on) manages to create the abstract LEER, run it through the mirror, and bring the resulting REEL back to the projection booth, the result is this curious movie -- an achievement reward. ]

The Projection Booth is north of Screening Room. It is indoors. "The booth is small and lined with [grey-carpet]. It smells faintly of hot dogs."

The grey-carpet is scenery in the Projection Booth. The printed name is "grey carpet". Understand "gray" or "grey" or "carpet" as the grey-carpet. The description is "In this dim light it's hard to give the carpet too exact an inspection, which I imagine is just as well."

The jotter is a notepad in the Projection Booth. "[A jotter] is propped up next to the projector." The description is "It's a little spiral-bound notebook, the kind reporters in old movies carry. It's full of notes: running times of movies. Numbers of people in the audience. Who clapped during potentially subversive scenes. Who arrived in a group of more than three."
	The allowed-pens of the jotter is { pen, pens }.
	The memo of the jotter is "Red: audience 14. FM couple. MM couple. M in raincoat. FFFFF group. F. MF. M.".

Report switching on the projector-switch when the reel is not in the projector:
	say "The light comes on, but nothing plays." instead.

	now the reel position of the reel is 1.
	
Report switching on the projector-switch when the reel is in the projector:
	say "[You] flip the switch. [The projector] comes to life with a hum. There's the usual flickering of light and dust, and then a black and white movie begins to play." instead.
	
Understand "movie" or "black and white" as the reel when the reel position of the reel is greater than 0.

The reel has a number called reel position.

[The reel here is a little bit like the tale, in that it produces a partially randomized story. This time, however, instead of going for a plot, we juxtapose a series of unexplained images and leave it up to the reader to try to imagine a connection between them -- a fires in the desert approach a la Wilmot's End, to borrow the language of Echo Bazaar. 

The intention is to suggest an encounter with a slightly inexplicable film that deals with emotional reactions towards the Atlantean threat and all that goes with it.

The filmmaker is Lucius Quagmire, whose manifesto can also be found in the Aquarium Bookstore by the determined searcher.]

Every turn when the reel is in the projector and the projector-switch is switched on (this is the movie advancement rule):	
	record "Lucius Quagmire award for viewing unusual films" as an achievement;
	if the location is Projection Booth or the location is Screening Room:
		say "[cartoon event for reel position of the reel]";
	increase the reel position of the reel by 1;
	if the reel position of the reel is greater than 4:
		now reel position of the reel is 1;
		now the projector-switch is switched off.  [if we go away for a while and come back, we'll find that the story has progressed in our absence]

Instead of examining the reel when the reel is in the projector and the projector-switch is switched on:

Check showing the reel on the projector when the reel is not in the projector:
	try inserting the reel into the projector;
	if the reel is not in the projector:
		stop the action.
		
Check showing the reel on the projector when the projector-switch is not switched on:
	try switching on the projector-switch;
	if the projector-switch is not switched on:
		stop the action. 
		
Test projection with "tutorial off / put reel on projector / turn on projector / take reel / mount reel / take reel / thread reel / take reel / show reel / show reel on projector / s / z / z / n" holding the reel in the Projection Booth.
		
Section 2 - Staircase
		

The Monumental Staircase is east of Park Center and north of Heritage Corner [and south of Outdoor Cafe]. "Once, the [central hillock] of the city was a fortified enclave, protected from the harbor and the peasant town by great walls. Now, however, the walls are mostly gone, except for a little spur that runs north from here. The walkways and tower are open to the public. 

Meanwhile a staircase as wide as a street [if the former direction is west]ascends into this town square, with the fountain playing at the cen[ter][otherwise]descends east from the town square toward the harbor[end if]."

Sanity-check going southeast from the Monumental Staircase:
	try going east instead.

Check waving the letter-remover at staircase-close-view when the current setting of the letter-remover is "i":
	say "The device buzzes, puzzled. Sadly it lacks the verve to understand a 'monumental starcase' as a poetic reference to the universe as a whole." instead.

Rule for distantly describing the Monumental Staircase:
	say "Off in that direction is the monumental staircase [if the location is High Street]that leads [up] to the town square, and [you] can just make out the tops of the heads of people standing near it[otherwise]that leads down towards the marina area of town[end if]."

After going to the Monumental Staircase from High Street:
	let N be the number of entries in the described motion of the player;
	if N is greater than 1:
		say "[path-walked so far]";
	otherwise:
		clear path-walked for player;
	if path description count is greater than 0:
		say "From there [you] have";
	otherwise:
		say "[one of][You] have[or]It's[at random]";
	increase path description count by 1;
	say " [one of]an invigorating[or]a healthy[or]a tiring[or]another wearying[or]yet another exhausting[stopping] climb up[unless N is greater than 1] the Monumental Staircase[end if], with the view of the sea getting better and better as [you] go[one of] (but of course looking requires stopping to gaze back over our shoulder)[or][stopping].[paragraph break]";
	continue the action.

The staircase-close-view is scenery in Monumental Staircase. The printed name is "monumental staircase". Understand "monumental" or "staircase" as staircase-close-view. The description of staircase-close-view is "[You] are standing on one of the upper steps right now, but the staircase descends (if shallowly) for another story or more towards high street." Instead of climbing the staircase-close-view, try going east. 

Instead of going down in Monumental Staircase, try going east. 

A poster is fixed in place in Monumental Staircase. "An enormous blue and orange warning [poster] covers the wall alongside the staircase." The description is "'WARNING: Have you seen these dangerous individuals? If so, avoid contact and report all interactions to the Bureau of Orthography.' Below, there's a picture of several people. One of them is you, before your face got shuffled with mine.[one of] It's funny that when we met, you mentioned you were a user of illegally modified language-tools, but you didn't emphas[ize] the grand larceny side so much.

Not to worry. I won't turn you in. I can hardly afford to, can I?[or][stopping]". Understand "blue" or "orange" or "enormous" or "huge" or "warning" as the poster.

A dangerous destruction rule for the poster:
	now the poster is not fixed in place;
	now the initial appearance of the poster is "The blue and orange warning [poster] is rolled up on the ground nearby."
	
Instead of taking or attacking the poster when the poster is in Monumental Staircase:
	if the poser is seen:
		make no decision;
	say "Defacing official property is illegal [--] like many other things [you][']ve done recently, I suppose [--] but more than usually likely to attract attention."



Fair is southwest of Monumental Staircase. [Postcard Stalls is northwest of Monumental Staircase.]

The central hillock is scenery in Monumental Staircase. The description is "A square park stretches east, with official buildings beyond, occupying what was once the fortified heart of town. 

A little of the original fortification does exist immediately north and curving around to the northwest, but it is in very bad shape here, and the top of the walls cannot be walked on at this point." Understand "city" or "fortified" or "walls" or "great" or "enclave" as the hillock.

The harbor-view is a distant backdrop. The printed name is "harbor". It is in Old Hexagonal Turret, Old City Walls, Crumbling Wall Face, Outdoor Cafe, and Monumental Staircase. It screens east and northeast. Understand "port" or "harbor" or "docks" or "dock" as harbor-view. The description is "A harbor swarming with small and medium-sized tourist boats; most of the major shipping comes in via another route." The introduction is "That is where [you] [are] trying to get to [--] or rather, get through."

The fish-market-view is a distant backdrop. The printed name is "fish market". It is in Old Hexagonal Turret, Old City Walls, Crumbling Wall Face, Outdoor Cafe, and Monumental Staircase. Understand "market" or "fish market" as the fish-market-view. The description is "From this angle and distance, all you can see is the open space and a few awnings. It's not the best time of day for this kind of thing anyway."

Instead of going down in the Staircase, try going east. Instead of going up in the Staircase, try going west.

The Open-Air is a region. The Fair, Church Forecourt, Midway, Heritage Corner, [Outdoor Cafe, ] Monumental Staircase, Park Center[, Postcard Stalls, and Food Corner] are in the Open-Air.

Section 3 - The Hostel

The Hostel is east of Heritage Corner. It is indoors. "I take it this is where you stayed from the time you got to town until our operation. I would have expected that someone with your credentials would have been able to afford something better: The Fleur d'Or, maybe? But maybe you thought this was lower-profile. At least it's clean and doesn't smell funny."

Instead of going out in the Hostel, try going west.

Rule for listing exits when in the Hostel:
	if looking, say "There's a [h-staircase] that leads up to the dormitory rooms.";
	otherwise say "[You] could either climb the [h-staircase] up to the dormitory rooms or go back to the park, [west]."

The h-staircase is an up-staircase. The h-staircase is in the Hostel. The printed name is "spiral staircase". Understand "spiral" or "staircase" as the h-staircase. It fronts up. The description is "To save space, it winds around a pole twice before reaching the floor above. This is not kind to people with luggage, but people with luggage are supposed to stay in real hotels."

Instead of facing up in the hostel:
	say "The ceiling is a little cracked but in no way fascinating."

The attendant's desk is a desk in the Hostel. The description is "Formica with a fake wood grain."

The attendant is a woman in the Hostel. The printed name is "desk attendant". Understand "desk attendant" as the attendant. "[The attendant] [if the current mood of the attendant is distrustful]watches us suspiciously[otherwise]is sort of eying us[end if]." The description of the attendant is "She's dressed in a kind of casual-hippy way: nose ring, poofy [blouse] that doesn't fit quite right."

The introduction of the attendant is "She doesn't recogn[ize] you [--] us [--] but that's a good thing, I think."

Definition: a thing is attendant-related:
	if it is the attendant, yes;
	if it is enclosed by the attendant, yes;
	no.

Instead of looking at an attendant-related thing through an authentication scope: 
	if the noun is the louse:
		do nothing instead;
	say "[The second noun] pings happily as [you] sight [the noun] with the crosshairs. [one of]'Do you mind?' [if the noun is the attendant]she[otherwise]the attendant[end if] asks. 'That's kind of rude.'[or]She sighs pointedly.[or]She mutters about people who can't take hints.[or]She ignores us stoically.[stopping]".

Guidebook is a book in the Hostel. The printed name is "Guidebook to Anglophone Atlantis". Understand "guidebook to atlantis" or "guide" or "book" or "guidebook to anglophone atlantis" as the guidebook. "Discarded in one corner is [a guidebook]." The description is "A much-thumbed and several years out-of-date guidebook to this immediate area. The cover is tomato-red but the pages are crinkly and beige: it appears that someone has spilled coffee on it.

There's too much here to take in in a quick read, but we could look up specific topics if we wanted to read more." The contents of the guidebook is the Table of Local Attractions.

After reading a command:
	while the player's command includes "the":
		cut the matched text.

Table of Local Attractions
topic	reply
"toilets" or "toilet" or "restroom" or "convenience" or "public convenience"	"The island is not overprovided with public toilets, but there is a building near the bus station."

"anglophone" or "atlantis" or "atlantean"	"The entire book concerns the island, so we'll have to be more specific about places and institutions."
"atlantida"	"Atlantida is listed here as the 'guiding spirit' of the island and its people. Representations of this abstraction can be found in posters and advertisements, and in the form of a great statue in the roundabout off Deep Street."
"aquarium" or "bookstore" or "aquarium bookstore"	"The entry describes the Aquarium Bookstore as a source of used and off-beat new books, especially those pertaining to 'alternate visions of Atlantis'. The phrase 'treasure trove' also appears, though in a context that makes clear this is code for 'fire hazard'."
"bureau/rotunda" or "bureau of orthography" or "orthography"	"The entry is long and greasily flattering: resplendent blue dome, magnificent interior, warm and hospitable employees, world-renowned historical research department, etc., etc., etc."
"Serial Comma Day" or "holiday"	"Commemorating the 1935 standard[ization] of a whole range of punctuation conventions, Serial Comma Day is one of three major patriotic holidays on Anglophone Atlantis. (See also SHAPLY DAY, SECESSION DAY.)"
"Shaply Day"	"Named in hon[our] of pioneering suffragette Phyllida Shaply, Shaply Day commemorates the 1877 decision to allow all citizens of Anglophone Atlantis to vote in referenda (the direct-democracy form for deciding contentious issues). This right was extended regardless of race, gender, or creed and is a source of considerable pride to Atlanteans."
"Secession Day" or "secession"	"The secession of Atlantis from British governance in 1823 culminated in the reduction of the attacking British fleet on April 19. The holiday celebrates this occasion, which is considered the beginning of Atlantean self-rule."
"cannon" or "depluralizing" or "depluralizing cannon" or "hexagonal" or "turret" or "depluralising" or "depluralising cannon"	"The Guidebook explains that Atlantis['] harb[our]s were traditionally defended by the deplural[izing] cannon, using techniques discovered by Clarence Arbot in 1779. Turrets along the old city walls provided elevated positions for these cannons, allowing them considerable range. See also SECESSION, CLARENCE ARBOT."
"sigil street" or "sigil"	"The entry on Sigil Street proclaims it an excellent place for those seeking to commission their own fonts or indulge in other typographical expenses."
"ampersand bend" or "ampersand/bend"	"Ampersand Bend is notable to the guidebook chiefly for the presence of a fine museum. A little less fine now that we've been past, perhaps."
"long street" or "long"	"Long Street is recorded as a go-to spot for high-end shopping and restaurant experiences."
"customs house" or "customs/house"	"The book offers advice that verges on churlish about how important it is not to commit any type of customs violation."
"clarence" or "arbot" or "clarence Arbot"	"A little copperplate engraving of a man with heavy-lidded eyes accompanies the sidebar biography of Clarence Arbot: b. 1732, proud parent of some 19 children; tireless researcher who in later years rarely left his laboratory 'except to go to bed'; in 1779, the inventor of generic deplural[ization], allowing multiples of almost anything to be reduced to just one. What his wives thought of his research is not recorded. See also DEPLURAL[IZING] CANNON."
"james/elias/milford/higgate" or "milford higgate" or "james elias" or "q-insertion"	"Milford Higgate and James Elias are commonly credited with the discovery of Q-insertion: the letter Q was the first that anyone was able to add to a word.

"DCL" or "dental" or "consonants" or "limited" or "dental consonants limited" or "dental consonants"	"Dental Consonants Limited is the largest and most successful linguistic engineering firm on the island, directly employing 15,000 people [--] 8% of the citizens of Anglophone Atlantis or 18% of the workforce. Thanks to its overwhelming significance to the local economy, DCL enjoys significant privileges in terms of support for its espionage policies. DCL builds a wide variety of machines for linguistic efficacy, but its most public[ize]d efforts are in the area of letter-insertion. The company was originally formed to work on T, D, and N-insertion."
"airport/airplane/airline/plane"	"There are no airports on the island that support commercial flights, though there is a landing strip for corporate jets coming in to the DCL campus."
"language/text/linguistics" or "linguistic efficacy"	"The Guidebook points out rather primly that only English is spoken on the island, due to the island's early discovery of linguistic efficacy. Except in special contexts such as sanctioned language classes, attempts to make oneself understood in other tongues will lead to shunning and possibly even jail time."
"history/past"	"The Guidebook gives a thumbnail description, and an extremely biased one, of how linguistic efficacy was discovered and put to use on the island, and its subsequent rise as an independent power when many other states were being absorbed into the empires of England, Spain, France, the Netherlands, etc. This is a bit rich considering that before achieving this independence Atlantis was in fact successively a Spanish, Dutch, and English territory; but local publishers tend to gloss that point a bit. See also MUSEUM."
"lodging/lodgings"	"The guidebook describes two options in the center of town: the hostel, suitable for people on a budget, and the much more expensive Fleur D'Or hotel."
"fleur d'or" or "fleur" or "hotel/hotels" or "fleur d'or hotel"	"The Fleur D'Or is listed as the town's only four-star hotel. (There are no five-star hotels on this island. It is not that kind of place.) As the Fleur d'Or principally attracts those interested in business or research to do with linguistic efficacy, it also maintains a bar with the only publicly-licensed homonym paddle. Visitors to the Fleur d'Or Drinks Club can enjoy linguistically-generated gimlets, rusty nails, and more."
"museum/exhibit/museums/exhibits"	"A museum of linguistic instruments open to the public is to be found on the grounds of the Fleur d'Or hotel."
"fountain" or "town square/park" or "park"	"The fountain is listed as one of the attractions of the old town park: the design and execution of the sculpture credited to one M. Antoinne, and was apparently his final work before he faced a firing squad for his use of an irregular surname. (This was during one of the more blood-soaked episodes of standard[ization], evidently.)"
"cinema/theater/theatre/movie/movies" or "movie theater/theatre"	"The Guidebook lists the cinema at the north end of the town park as the best place to see films 'correctly and legally dubbed'."
"hostel" or "backpacker"	"Mysteriously, the entry for the hostel itself, which ought to contain ratings of its cleanliness, safety, and reliability, has been obliterated with a black marker."
"[transit]" or "station" or "bus station"	"The book is forthright about the absence of public transportation, and recommends that visitors bent on vehicular travel should bring their own cars, since none are available locally for rent. A bus station with long-distance service cross-island to the town of Maiana can be found near Monument Green, though routes are not always served on holidays."
"fair/fairground/fairs/fairgrounds" or "market" or "farmer's market"	"The guidebook is lyrical about the phenomenal produce to be enjoyed at the farmer's market held in Hesychius Street every Saturday and Wednesday and also on special days of observation."
"fish market"	"The fish market, the guidebook explains, may be found at the northeastern part of town near the docks, and holds most of its sales in the early morning."
"dock/docks/boat/boats/ferry/ferries"	"The guidebook gives us to understand that the docks, found northeast of the central town, are a pleasant place to commission short voyages of exploration and to see the island from a distance. It does, however, warn against spending too much time in the adjacent taverns, which have an unsavory reputation."
"tavern/taverns" or "counterfeit" or "monkey" or "counterfeit monkey"	"The Counterfeit Monkey is a tavern of unsavory reputation near to the docks, said to be the locale of more fistfights and disturbances of the peace than the rest of the city put together. The tavern is named in hon[our] of a famous linguistic con job and was a regular site for contraband creation and smuggling. In 1929, the Bureau first developed tools and procedures for identifying linguistic fakes, the Monkey was the target of a law enforcement raid; but a lively and committed criminal community soon put the Monkey in business again with new strategies."
"all-purpose" or "all purpose"	"The All-Purpose, the guidebook explains, is a general civil servant attached to the Bureau of Orthography, with wide-ranging powers to repair, correct, and heal using a variety of linguistic tools."
"university/college/education"	"The guidebook praises the many excellent departments and exceptional research work performed at the university. This is all true, naturally."
"new church/cathedral" or "church/cathedral"	"The guidebook devotes two and a half pages to the splendors of the New Church, located on the western edge of the town square. It particularly admires the clean lines of the architecture, the solidly constructed pews, and the austere decoration; in fact, the more you read, the more the guide seems to be rhapsod[izing] about what the builders left [i]out[/i], instead of what they put in. The guide also recommends a visit to the church gift shop, which apparently supports assorted worthy causes, such as, for instance, buying a new roof for the structure and paying a custodial staff."
"food/eating/dining/restaurant/restaurants/eateries/cafe/cafes/café/bistro/cafés/eatery/lunch/dinner/breakfast"	"The guidebook lists several places to eat around town: the outdoor café near the docks; a Food Corner sometimes found in the town square; the restaurant attached to the Fleur D'Or hotel."
"lucius" or "quagmire" or "lucius quagmire" or "disturbance of meaning"	"A brief and plainly expurgated entry indicates that Lucius Quagmire was a film-maker in the early part of the 20th century who founded the Disturbance of Meaning group with the intention to  undermine the Anglophone hegemony. He was convicted of treason."


Every turn when the attendant carries a louse:
	say "The attendant screams, and performs some kind of strange dance, first brushing at her skin and then stomping at something on the ground. (So much for the louse, I think.)

She then tears out of the room, leaving the room unattended. Unfortunately, places like this don't keep anything of value out front anyway, so your natural gift for larceny hasn't much scope here.";
	move the louse to the repository;
	remove the attendant from play;
	if the attendant is the current interlocutor:
		reset the interlocutor.

The attendant wears a nose-ring and a blouse. The description of the blouse is "White cotton with little ribbons on it. I hate that kind of frilly nonsense." The description of the nose-ring is "It's silver and reasonably discreet." Understand "nose" or "nose ring" as the nose-ring. Understand "ring" as the nose-ring when the ring is not visible.

The Dormitory Room is above the Hostel. It is indoors. Understand "dorm" as the Dormitory Room. "Painted off-white, with [hard wood floors] under many layers of protective gloss coating: there are no surfaces in this room that would take a stain. Four [random dorm bed]s are lined up against the wall."

A dorm bed is usually scenery.

Four dorm beds are in the dormitory room. Understand "beds" as a dorm bed. The description of a dorm bed is "At this time of day, since everyone is checked out, the beds are all stripped down to bare mattress. Linens may be rented at the front desk [--] but [you][']re not staying here tonight, so there's no need to experience the thinning sheets and the pilled [if the player wears the Britishizing goggles]woollen[otherwise]woolen[end if] blankets. Your memory is enough for both of us." 


A backpacking girl is an alert tourist woman in the dormitory room. She exhibits caution.
	"[one of]A girl of about 19 [set prior to backpacking girl][if the girl is in the location]is standing in the middle of the room, looking around as though she can't quite believe where she landed or what she's doing here[otherwise]seems to be inclined to hang out here for the duration[end if][or][The backpacking girl] is still hanging out here[stopping]."
	The description is "She is just the sort of tourist who most annoys the locals, but actually I find her type a little endearing: she may not be very sophisticated yet, but she [i]wants[/i] to expand her horizons, and that's more than you can say for most of the friends she probably left back at home.". 
	The backpacking girl wears a pink t-shirt. The description of the pink t-shirt is "It is somewhat too tight and bears the word JUICY in rhinestones across the bust." Understand "shirt" as the pink t-shirt.
	She carries a heavy pack. The heavy pack is a closed openable container. The description of the heavy pack is "The flag of Canada is [canada-girl][if the player knows fake-canada]mendaciously [end if]sewn on the back." Understand "full" or "massive" or "massively" or "backpack" or "her backpack" or "her pack" or "flag" or "of Canada" as the heavy pack.
	The flexible appearance of the heavy pack is "A massively full pack leans against one of the beds." 
	Understand "tourist" as the backpacking girl.
	
Check waving the letter-remover at pink t-shirt when the current setting of the letter-remover is "r":
	say "That would be intriguingly disgusting, if it weren't for the fact that T-SHIT doesn't describe anything anyone with a functional colon has ever heard of." instead.
         
Test girl-description with "look" in the Dormitory Room.
	
Instead of opening the heavy pack in the presence of the backpacking girl:
	say "Overtly searching her possessions while she is here seems like a ticket to trouble."
	
The heavy pack contains an assortment of very short shorts, a broomstick skirt, flip-flops, bikini bottoms, various t-shirts, an anorak, a fat guidebook to Europe, a cheap camera, and a box of tampons.

Instead of taking the heavy pack:
	say "The girl may be a bit foolish, but she doesn't deserve to be robbed of all her worldly goods on the first day of her trip."

The description of the bikini bottoms is "The tops are not in evidence, at least as far as casual inspection reveals."

The description of the various t-shirts is "There's not a one without a logo of some kind."
	
Check waving the letter-remover at various t-shirts when the current setting of the letter-remover is "r":
	say "That would be intriguingly disgusting, if it weren't for the fact that T-SHIT doesn't describe anything anyone with a functional colon has ever heard of." instead.

The description of the very short shorts is "It's a good thing the weather here is really as warm as popularly imagined."

The description of the anorak is "It might be meant to counter the effect of all the shorts."

The description of the broomstick skirt is "It is the sort of skirt made of thin fabric that twists up into a tight tube, and is supposed to be interestingly crinkly when worn."

The description of the flip-flops is "The sole of each flip-flop is decorated with the image of Snoopy."

The description of the box of tampons is "Let's not. This is awkward enough already."

The description of the fat guidebook to Europe is "The spine is cracked at many points and the pages folded over for future reference."

The description of the cheap camera is "It is a flimsy device in rose-pink, with a very small lens."

Instead of taking something which is in the heavy pack:
	say "None of these are any use just now."

Chiding-attendant is a scene. Chiding-attendant begins when the dormitory room is visited. Chiding-attendant ends in results when the location of the player is the dormitory room and the location of the backpacking girl is the dormitory room and the backpacking girl recollects have-you-checked and the current quip is not have-you-checked and the current quip is not agree about the attendant and the backpacking girl is finished talking and the attendant is in the Hostel. 

Chiding-attendant ends fruitlessly when the location of the backpacking girl is not the dormitory room.

[We want to be set up by the girl's prior complaint, but we don't want the attendant to seem to come in response to said complaint.]

When chiding-attendant ends in results:
	say "There's a heavy tread on the stairs, and the desk attendant puts her head in. 'Just so you two know, you're not actually supposed to be hanging out a lot up here during the day. It's for night use really. I'm not going to do anything today, but it's kind of against the rules, for future reference.'

She turns around and goes back down. The backpacking girl sticks her tongue out at the departing back.".

[Something I wanted to do was try to break down the sense that NPCs are attached to single locations and never move around or interact with one another. On the other hand, scenes where NPCs move freely or converse in groups are harder to engineer, so I wanted to be sparing with those. So there are assorted intermediate effects where we get a little 'fake' interaction, a one-turn-only moment where one NPC addresses another or a character moves around.]

Report scoffing when chiding-attendant ended in results and the time since chiding-attendant ended is less than 2 minutes and the current interlocutor is the backpacking girl:
	say "We snort, and the girl grins at us. 'I know, she is unreal!'" instead.

Report laughing when chiding-attendant ended in results and the time since chiding-attendant ended is less than 2 minutes and the current interlocutor is the backpacking girl:
	say "We laugh, and the girl joins in. 'I know, she is unreal!'" instead.
	
Report frowning when chiding-attendant ended in results and the time since chiding-attendant ended is less than 2 minutes and the current interlocutor is the backpacking girl:
	say "We frown.

'Oh, whatever,' says the girl. 'She deserves it.'" instead.

An accessibility rule when the touch-goal is the lock:
	if the backpacking girl is not visible:
		make no decision;
	otherwise:
		say "[The backpacking girl] is watching our every move with unconcealed curiosity, which makes me a little hesitant to do anything with the locker[one of][or]. Maybe if we freaked her out somehow she would go away[or]. I think our best bet is to show her something that really weirds her out[stopping]." instead.

After writing a paragraph about a dorm bed: 
	now every dorm bed in the location is mentioned. 

Some hard wood floors are scenery in the Dormitory room. Understand "floor" or "hardwood" or "protective" or "gloss" or "coating" as the hard wood floors. The description is "The floors are designed to be scrubbed clean every single day, leaving no trace of what might have come or gone." 

Instead of putting something on the hard wood floors, try dropping the noun.

The locker is a fixed in place closed openable container in the Dormitory Room. The lock is part of the locker. The initial appearance of the locker is "The [locker] you identify as your own sits near one of the beds[if the locker is open], door standing open[otherwise if the lock is part of the locker], still locked with its dial [lock][otherwise], closed but not locked[end if]. ".

A ranking rule for the locker: 
	increase description-rank of the locker by 100.

The description of the locker is "A standard metal [locker] for travelers to leave their valuable possessions in when they go out [--] or while they sleep, since one's bunkmates are not always to be trusted. It is of the kind that requires the traveler to bring his own lock[if the lock is part of the locker], and in fact someone (such as yourself) has put a lock on this one[otherwise], but it is currently bare[end if]."

After opening the locker:
	record "opening the locker" as achieved;
	complete "Retrieve your remaining possessions from locker at hostel";
	say "Now that the lock has been removed, the locker swings easily open[if something is in the locker], revealing [a list of things in the locker][end if]." instead.

The lock can be lockable. The lock can be locked. The lock can be openable. The lock can be open. The lock is openable, lockable and locked. Understand "dial" as the lock.

Instead of turning the lock: 
	say "The dial turns smoothly [--] much too smoothly. There are no clicks, no tiny ticks of inward mechanisms working. By the feel of it, there might be no real locking device here at all." 
	
Understand the command "spin" as "turn".

The description of the lock is "[one of]It's curious, now you look at it: it's a combination lock with a dial face, but no one has bothered putting any numerals onto the dial.[or]Still no numbers on the dial. My mother had a wristwatch like that once. Always a nuisance.[or]I once again contemplate the absence of traditional combination markings on the lock. It must not be meant to be unlocked in the usual way.[or]It's your lock: you brought it with you and put it on the locker. So you must have had some way of opening it again, and not something that would depend on having a clear memory after the operation, either. I don't suppose you remember at all?[stopping]". 

To say key-refusal for (locked-thing - the lock):
	say "[lock description][paragraph break]".
	
Instead of setting the lock to something:
	say "No numbers are written on the dial of the lock."

Locking something with something is key-related behavior. Unlocking something with something is key-related behavior. Unlocking keylessly something is key-related behavior. Locking keylessly something is key-related behavior. Opening something is key-related behavior. Closing something is key-related behavior.

Instead of key-related behavior when the current action involves the locker and the lock is part of the locker:
	if the noun is the locker, change the noun to the lock;
	if the second noun is the locker, change the second noun to the lock;
	try the current action.

Instead of attacking the locker with something:
	say "It is built to withstand attack, as witness the several dents in the frame that nonetheless failed to pop the door out."
	
Instead of attacking or pulling or pushing the lock:
	say "It swings jauntily in place, but does not break."


The locker contains a roll of bills and a letter. The printed name of the roll of bills is "roll". The description of the roll of bills is "[one of]Now that is more like it: you've got us a tidy little stash of euros here.[or]Some day you will have to tell me a little bit about the tricks of the trade [--] how you fenced stuff, you know? Or perhaps you won't tell me. Maybe it would be better not. At any rate, this money is useful, so I won't ask too many questions.[or]It's our cash reserve [--] well, your cash reserve, really, but for now it is serving both of us.[stopping]". Understand "euros" or "euro" or "cash" or "bill" or "money" as the bills.

The bills are essential.


[Andra's backstory was based in the idea that she was an extraordinarily good speller, and I imagined a whole history for her, in which she had been a homeschooled spelling champion who ran away from home when she was disappointed by her parents' reaction to her coming in second place nationally. Slango had seen her on television and so when he recognized her on a street, he picked her up and inducted her into his smuggling gang.

There wasn't room to tell that whole story in Counterfeit Monkey, and eventually I spun that story off as Bee, a Varytale novella which takes place in more or less the real world.

Nonetheless, Andra retains some pointers to that history.]

The description of the letter is "It's a letter from your brother, printed off anonymously from an untraceable email account that you accessed in town. Nothing that could be followed back to Slango and the yacht.

[i]Sis,

I'm keeping your wire transfer funds. I want to try for Stanford. 

I'd say thank you except that, one, you didn't get it legally (I saw this documentary about teen prostitutes [--] if that's where it came from then EW) and, two, honestly? You owe for what you put us through after you ran away. Mom and Dad were humiliated that you turned into the prodigal daughter. Your face got on milk cartons. Pastor Hughes GAVE A SERMON ABOUT IT. 

Mom spent all that time coaching you through spelling practice, you know she doesn't enjoy getting up at 4 AM, right? You totally threw that in their faces.

If you want to come home sometime, fine, but don't come to just see me. If you want to see me you have to see Mom and Dad too.

Nate.[/i]". 



Some secret-plans are in the locker. They are privately-named.
	The printed name is "plans".
	Understand "plan" or "plans" as the secret-plans.
	The description of the secret-plans is "The plans are rolled up and stuck shut with a label that reads 'PROPERTY OF DENTAL CONSONANTS LIMITED [--] UNAUTHOR[IZE]D USE ILLEGAL'. They're just a set of prints from the main computer design, of course, but still extremely informative: to the right engineer, they might reveal the secret of T-insertion for replication by other companies. These are what you and Brock were originally contracted to lift from the island, at a fee in the multiple millions.". The secret-plans are essential, illegal, floppy, and long. Understand "tube" as the secret-plans when the tube is not visible. Understand "label" as the secret-plans.

Understand "count [bills]" as a mistake ("[You] thumb quickly through the bills [--] smaller currency on the outside, larger denominations on the inside. I wouldn't have thought I could add that quickly and accurately, but you, evidently, have more practice. It works out to just over fifteen thousand euros.").



Section 4 - The New Church

The New Church is west of the Church Forecourt. It is indoors and proper-named. "Not a Gothic cathedral from the era when the church was wealthy and secure, but a gallant Neo-classical response to the turmoil of the 18th century, when the power of language was just beginning to be evident, and instead of an immutable cosmology, we suddenly had observer-consensus reality. [one of]What is the need or use of God, if it turns out that He gave all the power of creation to Adam when He let him name the animals?[or][stopping]".

The inscription is fixed in place in the New Church. It is distant. "An [inscription] above [the altar], picked out in gold paint, reads Ἐν ἀρχῇ ἦν ὁ λόγος." Understand "paint" or "gold" as the inscription.
	The description is "It means, In the Beginning was the Word. 
	
A patchy attempt to make theology align with scientific and linguistic reality, but it still has power. And despite the Bureau's depredations of foreign language writings everywhere else, they have never quite had the nerve to deface this." 
	
Some columns are scenery in the New Church. The description of the columns is "The column shafts are unornamented, only tapering a little at the top; the capitals a restrained Ionic." Understand "pillar" or "pillars" or "column" as the columns.

Some clear glass windows are scenery in the New Church. The description of the clear glass windows is "They admit a great deal of light, as though to promise that there is no lie and no chicanery here." Understand "window" as the clear glass windows.
	
The introduction of New Church is "My mother volunteers here: I think I should warn you. She is not quite religious, but believes in the cultural value of the building, and in having some sort of place where people can go for spiritual respite. She also, I suspect, likes having those great gold letters, defiantly foreign and arcane in the heart of the old city."

Some pews are a scenery supporter in the New Church. The description of the pews is "Simply built out of dark solid wood, to contrast with the white walls and columns, and the clear glass windows." Understand "pew" or "seat" or "seats" or "bench" or "benches" as the pews.
 

The altar is fixed in place in the New Church. It is a supporter. 

Definition: 
	a thing is liturgical:
		if it is the cross, yes;
		if it is the cassock, yes;
		if it is the tippet, yes.

Instead of putting something on the altar:
	if the player wears a liturgical thing:
		if the noun is the cross: 
			record "Reverend Plaice award for placing the cross on the altar while liturgically dressed" as an achievement;
			continue the action;
		else:
			say "While I am not exactly a believer in the dogmas associated with this place, it seems crass to go putting random items on the altar.";
	else:
		say "[You] [are] not vested appropriately for dressing the altar; someone would be sure to notice."

The description of the altar is "It is simple and bare of cloth or flowers[if the cross is on the altar], though a cross is set in the appropriate place[end if]."

Instead of facing up in the New Church:
	say "The ceiling is handsomely solid but not decorated: no painted feet of the ascendant Christ dangling down between clouds, no medieval grotesques or floral bosses. "

Instead of going north in the New Church:
	say "The only thing in that direction is the little space behind the altar, and to enter that seems like needless trespassing."

Rule for listing exits when in New Church:
	if boldening is true: 
		say "There are side exits both [b]east[/b] and [b]west[/b]; and a gift shop occupies the narthex at the [b]south[/b] end.";
	else:
		say "There are side exits both east and west; and a gift shop occupies the narthex at the south end."
	
Understand "pray" or "pray to [text]" as a mistake ("[prayer response]").

To say prayer response:
	say "I'm not much one for prayer myself. But you, evidently, are, and I find myself squirming[--]

(While your mind and heart are elsewhere, ordering your concerns and offering them up.)

[--]and now quiet. I don't know what, if anything, that may have accomplished, but I promise not to be rude if you need to do it again."
	
The gift-shop-exterior is a facade in New Church. It is scenery. It fronts south. The description is "[You] can't really see it from here; I just know that it is back there, from previous visits, though decently screened from the main body of the church."  Understand "shop" or "gift shop" or "narthex" as the gift-shop-exterior. The printed name is "gift shop".

The Cathedral Gift Shop is south of the New Church. Understand "narthex" as the cathedral gift shop. It is indoors. "This area used to be a sort of antechamber where the priests and choir might gather for processions into the church, but it has now been done over for retail purposes. This is one of several schemes to make the New Church pay for its own upkeep: a problem is that people somehow feel everything associated with a church ought to be free, including lunchtime concerts, potluck suppers, and Thursday-night lecture series."

The gift-shop counter is a scenery supporter in the Cathedral Gift Shop. The description is "The usual arrangement for making purchases."

Some wire racks are scenery things in the Cathedral Gift Shop. The description is "They're designed to hold postcards or other similar small merchandise." Understand "rack" as racks.

Some postcards are on the wire racks. The description of the postcards is "You may be a tourist in these parts, but I, my curious friend, am not: so I find these pictures all rather foolish, and not at all representative of the town as it really is." The postcards are scenery. Understand "pictures" or "harbor" or "city walls" or "walls" or "fortifications" or "ancient fortifications" or "cards" or "harbour" or "postcard" or "picture" or "architecture" or "souvenirs" as the postcards.

	now the postcards are on the wire rack.

Test rack with "x postcards / wave s-remover at racks / x postcards / open tub / gel rack / x postcards" holding the tub in the Gift Shop.

Instead of buying the postcards:
	say "And send them where? There is no one [you] wish were here."

Instead of turning the racks:
	say "[You] idly turn one of the racks, as though [you] were a tourist here. Familiar pictures swivel past, both of the church interior and of the town as a whole."

Instead of taking or buying the postcards,
	say "Buying souvenirs is not the current objective."
	
Instead of buying the paper-models:
	say "I am all thumbs and never get these things right."

Instead of buying the souvenir tea-towels:
	say "They're just too embarrassingly cute."
	
Instead of buying the shot glasses:
	say "The inscribed proverbs about the merits and demerits of the grape would be likely to put me off my drink."
	
Some tomes are a fixed in place thing in the Cathedral Gift Shop. "A long line of dusty [tomes] are lined up on one of the shelves, marked 'free for taking'. None are missing." A component-tome is part of the tomes. The printed name of the component-tome is "tome". Understand "tome" or "book" as the component-tome.

The description of the tomes is "Looking at one gives a sense of all. [description of the tome]". The description of the component-tome is "[description of the tome]".

Instead of taking the tomes:
	say "The full set runs to thirty or forty volumes, each one three inches thick and printed on heavy paper. They're much too bulky to carry off."
	
Instead of taking the component-tome:
	say "[You] reach for one of the volumes, then stop, indecisive. They really do seem to be a set, and I can't bring myself to break it up."
	
Some paper-models, some souvenir tea-towels, and some shot glasses are scenery in the Cathedral Gift Shop. Understand "model" or "souvenirs" or "paper" or "models" as the paper-models. Understand "window" or "windows" or "inscription"  as the model when the model is the prior named noun. Understand "towel" or "souvenirs" or "towels" or "tea" as the tea-towels. Understand "glass" or "souvenirs" as the shot glasses.

The printed name of the paper-models is "paper models".

Instead of inserting something into shot glasses in the presence of the volunteer:
	say "The volunteer fixes us with such a steely stare that [you] stop immediately."
	
The description of the paper-models is "With four or five hours['] lab[our], and a quantity of white glue and toothpicks, you too could assemble your very own rendition of the church, complete with windows and a printed-on version of the inscription over the altar; in fact, the model is so cleverly made that it can be taken apart to allow a view in cross-section."

The introduction of the paper-models is "Despite all that, I think [you][']ll pass."

The description of the souvenir tea-towels is "Embroidered with gaudy logos."

The description of the shot glasses is "Printed with various Biblical verses related to drinking."

The gift shop volunteer is an alert man in Cathedral Gift Shop. "An elderly man in a [knitted wool cap] presides over the gift shop." Understand "elderly" or "man" as the gift shop volunteer. 

Rule for writing a topic sentence about the gift shop volunteer when the gift shop volunteer is not the current interlocutor:
	set the current interlocutor to the gift shop volunteer;
	say "The elderly man in charge of the gift shop nods at us as [you] come in.[run paragraph on]";
	now everything held by the gift shop volunteer is mentioned.

The description of the gift shop volunteer is "He has one of those withered-apple faces more frequent in old women, but there is no doubt from the shape of his nose and the slight stubble that he is in fact male."

The gift shop volunteer wears a knitted wool cap. The description of the knitted wool cap is "It is made of some kind of soft and fuzzy blue yarn." Understand "yarn" as the knitted wool cap.

The Church Garden is west of New Church. "One might expect a graveyard, but burial inside the city walls has been forbidden for sanitation reasons since well before the New Church was built. Instead, there is a small meditation garden, which was once designed as an intricate knotwork of shrubs[if the thicket is not in the location]. Now the shrubs are gone[end if]."

Report facing in Church Garden:
	say "The garden is intentionally a space set apart, from which it is hard to see anything of the rest of the world." instead.

Instead of listening to the Church Garden: say "The sounds of the outside world are muted here. There is some traffic noise, it's true; it just doesn't seem terribly important from here."

Understand "meditate" as a mistake ("I'm not bringing you on a tandem ride through my psyche. Sorry.").



The thicket is a fixed in place thing in the Church Garden. "The knotwork has since grown into [a thicket].".

Instead of looking under the thicket:
	say "Nothing is beneath."

Instead of taking the thicket:
	say "It grows much too densely to be pulled out of the ground."

Before putting gel on the ticket:
	if the player is not in Church Garden, say "It would probably cause inconvenience, not to mention drawing considerable attention, to remake the thicket anywhere but in the garden from which it came." instead;
	if the soil is not in Church Garden, say "There is no longer anywhere for the thicket to grow." instead;
	if the ticket is not in Church Garden
	begin;
		if the player does not carry the ticket, try taking the ticket;
		if the player does not carry the ticket, stop the action;
		try dropping the ticket;

The description is "Immediately to the north is the [tower-side] of the old city walls.

The Roundabout is southeast of the High Street. The Roundabout is a road. "The traffic flows in a tight circle around a statue which [if Traffic Circle is visited][you] know all too well[otherwise][you] can never see clearly[end if][if the player is not in the car].

Unfortunately, there is no other quick way to get around this part of town[end if]."

The hard-to-see statue is scenery in the Roundabout. The description is "[if Traffic Circle is visited]It is, curiously, easier to get a sense of from a distance than it was close-up in the Traffic Circle[otherwise]I've seen it before: it's supposed to be Atlantida, the Spirit of the Atlantean people[end if].

Some carpet is in the Two-Star Hotel. It is scenery.

A hotel sofa is an enterable supporter in the Two-Star hotel. It is scenery. "No one has to sit there at the moment, which is the key point."

The front desk is a scenery supporter in the Two-Star hotel. The description of the front desk is "No one is sitting there now; but this entire time of year must be a bit of a slump for the hotel, since there is not a busy tourist trade running through on its way to buses out of town."

Part 4 - Affluence

Chapter 1 - City Walls

Section 1 - Old City Walls

Old City Walls are north of the Monumental Staircase. Understand "wall" as Old City Walls. "Only portions of the old walls still stand, but you can walk along what remains, as though you were defending the place. They're a me[ter] and a half wide, made of ashlar blocks. On the vertical faces these blocks are still rough, but underfoot they have been worn smooth by the passage of many defenders and (subsequently) tourists. One of the [defaced ashlar block]s in the wall has even been defaced, some old inscription gouged out.[one of]

I used to like to climb around up here when I was a kid. I made believe[--] oh, you'll think it's silly.[or][stopping]

Down below in the distance are the docks and the sea, and immediately east of here is an old hexagonal [turret-view]."

The defaced ashlar block is scenery in Old City Walls. Understand "blocks" or "ashlar" or "inscription" as block. The description is "To judge by its different shaping and col[our], the defaced block is something borrowed from an older building to make up the new wall: taken out of a church or a mosque or perhaps even a Roman fortification in some earlier era of the island. 

It was once inscribed with a message, but whatever it was, the foreign-language writing has been completely chiseled away so as to be illegible.".

Rule for printing the name of the defaced ashlar block while looking:
	say "block".

Instead of putting the restoration gel on the defaced ashlar block:
	say "The gel has no ability to restore that which was physically damaged; only letter-changes can be removed."

Section 2 - The Turret

The Old Hexagonal Turret is east of Old City Walls. "Up here [you] stand on the remains of the old fortifications; this turret offers a view out over the docks, the fish market, and the harbor, which it was designed to protect."

The depluralizing cannon is a container in the Old Hexagonal Turret. It is fixed in place. Understand "heavy" or "old" or "barrel" as the depluralizing cannon. The printed name is "deplural[izing] cannon".
	"A heavy old [depluralizing cannon] is aimed out to sea."
	The description is "Like a conventional cannon it has a mounting to allow the users to turn the gun and change its angle, to hit objects at various ranges.
	
It is currently unloaded, of course; but time was when this vast weapon was employed to reduce entire fleets to a single ship, and a whole crew of marines to a single man. This tactic was found so effective that the harbor was never successfully taken."

Sanity-check turning or pushing or pulling the depluralizing cannon:
	say "With considerable effort, we manage to point the cannon a little more [one of]towards the open sea[or]towards the docks[or]towards the cliffs opposite[cycling]. Not that that does any good." instead.

The deep purple residue is part of the depluralizing cannon. The description is "Deplural[izing] shot is usually a very dark purple near to black, and some may have scraped off on the inside of the barrel."
	The scent-description is "smoke and leather".

Instead of searching the depluralizing cannon:
	say "There's nothing to see inside the old barrel except perhaps the faintest traces of a [deep purple residue]."

Sanity-check inserting something into the depluralizing cannon:
	say "No doubt it would be interesting to fire [the noun] out over the marina, but it's neither possible nor wise." instead.

Sanity-check entering the depluralizing cannon:
	say "Col[our]ful as it would be to climb into the cannon and fire ourselves straight out to sea, this is not a viable option. I would have tried it before now if it were." instead.

Instead of facing south in Old Hexagonal Turret:
	say "That way is mostly empty air, though if [you] look south and down over the edge, there is a vertiginous view down to the bottom of the monumental staircase. Tourists and natives are climbing up and down."

The mounting is part of the depluralizing cannon. The description is "Everything is stiff and motionless now."

Instead of turning or pushing or pulling the mounting:
	say "No matter what [you] do [you] won't be able to aim or fire the old cannon; which is just as well, since to do so would be a major felony under local penal code, and a war crime under international conventions."
	
Understand "fire [cannon]" or "load [cannon]" or "aim [cannon]" or "use [cannon]" as a mistake ("[You] haven't got the shot for this thing, and for very good reason. There may not even be any still in existence, but if there is, the Bureau will keep it under lock and key.").

Section 3 - The Walls Crumble

Crumbling Wall Face is north of the Old City Walls. "The wall once continued north from here some distance before curving northwest around the remainder of the city. So much has crumbled away, though, that the walkway is impassable north of this point. To protect citizens, there is a [safety railing] across the [view of jagged wall].

A [metal ladder] of four rungs descends the inner face of the wall, allowing pedestrians access to the streets to the west."

Sanity-check going north in Crumbling Wall Face:
	say "The wall pretty much falls away into slippery rubble at that point, which is why there's a safety railing in the way." instead.

rule for listing exits while looking in Crumbling Wall Face:
	do nothing instead.
	
Instead of facing southeast in Crumbling Wall Face:
	say "[You] would have to go south and then east to reach it, but that way is the top of the hexagonal turret."

The fossil is a thing in Crumbling Wall Face. "Among the rubble fill of the wall is [if we have examined the fossil]a fossil[otherwise]an odd spiral-shaped rock[end if]."
	Understand "odd" or "spiral-shaped" or "spiral" or "shaped" or "rock" or "stone" as the fossil.
	The description is "[one of]The spiral rock turns out to be a fossil, from one of those sea creatures long ago.[or]It is perhaps an inch and a half long, the shape of a corkscrew seashell that once housed something small and soft. There are thousands of these things around; they're not exactly valuable, but an interesting curiosity all the same.[stopping]".

Instead of examining the view of jagged wall when we have not examined the fossil:
	try examining the fossil.

The view of jagged wall is a distant backdrop in Crumbling Wall Face. It screens north. The printed name is "broken edge".

The description is "The masonry has broken away, revealing the rubble fill inside the wall and making a dangerously unstable surface of craggy rocks.". Understand "edge" or "broken" or "rubble" or "craggy" or "rocks" or "gravel" or "unstable" or "jagged" or "masonry" as the view of jagged wall. Understand "rock" as the view of jagged wall when the rock is not visible and the fossil is not visible.

The safety railing is scenery in Crumbling Wall Face. The description is "Though it shows traces of surface rust, the safety railing is sturdy and close-fitted enough to prevent anyone, child or adult, from taking a tumble down the jagged masonry.". Understand "rail" as the safety railing. 

Instead of turning or pulling or pushing the safety railing:
	say "It proves gratifyingly resistant to your attempts."

Instead of climbing the safety railing: 
	say "It's here for our protection."

The metal ladder is a down-staircase in Crumbling Wall Face. It is fixed in place. The description is "The rungs [if the noun is not the metal ladder]of the ladder [end if]have been bolted individually into the stone." Understand "rungs" or "rung" as the metal ladder.

Instead of going down in Crumbling Wall Face, try going west.

The Walltop is a region. The Old City Walls, the Crumbling Wall Face, and the Old Hexagonal Turret are in The Walltop.

Instead of listening to a location in Walltop:
	say "The noises that reach us are the sounds of distant traffic, the occasional horn blast from the docks, and some cheery shouting from the direction of the fair."
	
Test wallbug with "tutorial on / n" in Crumbling Wall Face.

Chapter 2 - Residential District

Section 1 - Hesychius Street

Hesychius Street is west of Old City Walls. The description is "As the street names make obvious, this part of town was laid out in a different political age, when it was considered more important to commemorate linguistic richness than to standard[ize] practices[if Webster court is unvisited].

This is also the edge of the richest part of town, with houses [--] really, almost villas [--] that were built for households with servants. My parents['] place is just a block or two north of here[end if][if the farmer's stall is in Hesychius Street].

On holidays like today, this street is often host to a farmer's market; though it is now late enough in the day that most of the farmers have given up and gone home, taking with them their twenty-three varieties of pickled olives, their loganberry jam, and their pigs[']-feet-in-aspic[otherwise].

Even the single farmer from earlier is now gone[end if]."

A fortified villa is a scenery facade in Hesychius Street. It fronts west. The description is "An especially solid and safe-looking villa with no entrance on this side. It was built, originally, by the head of the customs office, when that post was somewhat more dangerous than it is today. I admit I don't know who lives there now."
	The closure notice is "There are no doors in [the item described] from this angle. ".

Rule for listing exits when looking in Hesychius Street:
	do nothing.

A farmer's stall is scenery in Hesychius Street. The description is "It appears to belong to the farmer. It's made of wood and canvas and offers a little shade against the harsh sun. Previous customers have cleared most of it off[if the farmer carries something], but the farmer still has [a list of things carried by the farmer][end if]." 

Rule for printing the name of farmer's stall while looking:
	say "stall".

The farmer is a man in the Hesychius Street. The description is "Contrary to your obvious expectations, he is dressed more or less like anyone else, and is neither wearing quaint overalls nor chewing a piece of hay."

Rule for writing a paragraph about the farmer:
	say "One remaining [farmer] lazes here, watching his [farmer's stall].";
	now every thing carried by the farmer is mentioned.


An asparagus is carried by the farmer. It is a vegetable. The indefinite article of the asparagus is "some".  The description of the asparagus is "It looks particularly tender and pleasant, but I avoid the stuff."

A lime is carried by the farmer. It is a vegetable. The description of the lime is "A small, wrinkled, intense-looking fruit: it wouldn't give much juice, but is likely very strong."

A yam is a kind of vegetable.

A white-yam is carried by the farmer. It is a yam. The printed name of the white-yam is "yam". Understand "yam" as the white-yam. The description of the white-yam is "A yam with whitish skin. Some of the dirt of the farm still adheres to it."

[Rule for deciding the concealed possessions of the farmer: 
	if buying something from someone, no;
	yes.]
	
A description-concealing rule:
	now every thing which is carried by the farmer is not marked for listing.

Section 2 - Webster Court

Webster Court is north of Hesychius Street and west of Crumbling Wall Face. "[if former direction is north]Hesychius Street opens here into a broad and plainly-paved court[otherwise if former direction is west]Here below the wall is a broad, plainly-paved court[otherwise]A broad and plainly-paved court[end if][unless statue of Noah Webster is as-yet-unknown], named for [the statue of Noah Webster][end if]."

Instead of facing west in Webster Court:
	say "The old city wall cuts off any view towards the harbor and the far horizon. The taller houses permit a view over, however."
	
Instead of facing northwest in Webster Court:
	say "Roget Close is west, but there's no passage or street running northwest."	

[Instead of facing northeast in Webster Court:
	say "[You] could go that way around behind my parents' house and enjoy their garden. They " ]

Rule for distantly describing Webster Court:
	say "In that direction is Webster Court, as made unmistakable by the gleaming bronze pate of old Noah himself."
	
A description-concealing rule:
	if the statue of Noah Webster is not as-yet-unknown:
		now the statue of Noah Webster is not marked for listing. [after its first introduction it becomes scenery, since it's not really interactive and we want to emphasize other things]

The statue of Noah Webster is a fixed in place thing in Webster Court. "Lending its name to the location is a bronze statue of Noah Webster." 
	Understand "bronze" as the statue.
	The description is "It's that hero of spelling reform, and personally responsible for the island going over to American[ize]d spellings over the British standard."
	The introduction is "My mother likes to irritate my father by quoting what his contemporaries called Webster: a 'viper', a 'maniacal pedant', and (always a fav[our]ite at Reform Day parties) 'a toad in the service of [i]sans-culottism[/i]'. She makes sure to pronounce that in the most Parisian accent possible."
	
Rule for listing exits while looking in Webster Court:
	say "The streets continue south, east, and west; and just to the northeast is my parents['] side garden."
	
	
Check waving the letter-remover at the statue of Noah Webster when the current setting of the letter-remover is "u":
	say "The device chokes on the concept, though my mother might say that this whole island is already the State of Noah Webster." instead.
	
A description-concealing rule when the location is not Webster Court:
	now the statue of Noah Webster is not marked for listing.
	
Instead of examining the statue of Noah Webster when the player is not in Webster Court:
	say "From this distance the statue is little more than a glare of sunlight."
	
After deciding the scope of the player when Webster Court is adjacent to the location: 
	place the statue of Noah Webster in scope.

My parents' home is a facade in Webster Court. The printed name is "my parents['] home". Understand "house" or "building" or "pink" or "large building" as my parents' home. "The [one of]large building just to the north [--] yes, the one in pale pink [--][or]large, pale pink building north of us[stopping] is [my parents' home]." The introduction is "I think I mentioned that my parents were well off. My father works for the Bureau, embarrassingly, and my mother was born into the kind of money that we like to pretend doesn't exist on this island."
	The description is "It's stucco and tile, inspired by southern California ideas of gracious living. There are potted palm trees inside, and leather sofas, and French oil paintings for which expensive importation lic[ense]s had to be bought. 
	
My childhood bedroom faces northwest, away from the docks, towards the roofs of other villas and the open sea."


The pink door is north of Webster Court and south of Foyer. The pink door is a door. The pink door is scenery. It is lockable and locked. 

Parental appearance is a scene. Parental appearance begins when the location is webster court and Patriotic chard-garden is visited and Private Beach is visited.
	
When parental appearance begins:
	move fake-father to the location;
	say "The door to my parents['] house opens and my father comes out. He's talking over his shoulder: 'Sorry, dear, but [i]someone[/i] has to be on call.'

My mother answers from inside, but we can't make out what she's saying.

'Surge on the grid,' Father replies. 'Could be an unauthor[ize]d synthes[ize]r, but more likely... yes, exactly. I'll try to be home before the fireworks.'

He closes the door behind him.";
	if the player wears the monocle:
		try taking off the monocle;
		if the player encloses the backpack:
			if the backpack is closed:
				try opening the backpack;
			if the backpack is open:
				try inserting the monocle into the backpack;
		
Report taking off the monocle in the presence of fake-father:
	say "Hastily I take off our monocle and palm it. Father shouldn't recogn[ize] us in our current body, but wearing expensive Bureau equipment in his presence would be a terrible idea." instead.

fake-father is a man. fake-father is privately-named. The printed name of fake-father is "Father". Understand "father" as fake-father. The description of fake-father is "He looks put out. Serial Comma Day is supposed to be a day off, even for him." The initial appearance is  "My father is just outside [my home]. He's clipping the cuffs of his trousers so that he won't snag them on anything during his ride in to work. His scooter is propped against the [statue of Noah Webster], ready for action."

After writing a paragraph about fake-father:
	now the prior named noun is fake-father.

Sanity-check doing something other than examining something during parental appearance: 
	if the current action is the action of taking off the monocle:
		make no decision;
	if the current action is the action of opening the backpack:
		make no decision;
	if the current action is the action of inserting the monocle into the backpack:
		make no decision;
	say "We don't dare drawing father's attention. I'm going to have us stand over here as though checking on the health of the neighb[our][']s lawn, shall I?" instead.

Parental appearance ends when turn-taken is true.

Turn-taken is a truth state that varies. Before reading a command during parental appearance: now turn-taken is true.

Rule for listing exits while looking during parental appearance:
	do nothing.
	
Instead of waiting during parental appearance:
	say "We hold our breath."

Sanity-check going somewhere during parental appearance:
	say "Hang on; I want to see where [fake-father] goes." instead.

When parental appearance ends:
	remove fake-father from play;
	now turn-taken is false;
	say "[if the prior named noun is fake-father]He[otherwise]My father[end if] sees us from a distance and gives a neighb[our]ly wave. 'Happy Punctuating!' he shouts.
	
I wave back rather weakly.
	
He gets on his [if not looking]small red [end if]scooter, checks his helmet, and revs off to the south. Off, apparently, to investigate the synthes[ize]r that put us together. That will go slowly because of the holiday, but I'm guessing there will be Bureau investigators crawling all over the south side of old town in an hour or two."

Instead of doing something to the pink door:
	say "Walking into my parents['] house is the action perhaps most likely to get us caught."

Rule for printing the name of the pink door:
	if the player can see the pink door, say "door here";
	otherwise say "door of my parents['] villa".
		
[Because we need to stop you so that you can see the scene with Dad if you were otherwise just going to be passing through:]
After going to Webster Court when Private Beach is visited and Patriotic Chard-Garden is visited and parental appearance has not happened :
	let N be the number of entries in the described motion of the player;
	if N is greater than 1:
		say "[path-walked so far][paragraph break]";
		clear path-walked for the player;
		increase path description count by 1; 
	otherwise:
		try looking;
	now approach-destination is Winding Footpath. [Tricks the approaching verb into stopping here even if you're trying to reach someplace really far away.]
	[pause the game. ]
	
Section 3 - Chard-Garden

The Patriotic Chard-Garden is northeast of Webster Court. Understand "patriotic garden" or "chard garden" as the patriotic chard-garden.
	The description is "A narrow strip of land between the house and the edge of my parents['] property. The eastern edge runs right up to the [decaying old wall] of the city, which here means some stumpy masonry on this side and a dizzying drop on the other. 

The rest of their terraces and gardens are fenced off."
	The introduction is "Because it's so linguistically productive, chard is something of a national symbol; and during the world wars, there was a fad of gardening at home. After the war, it became common for affluent people with a little bit of land to keep their garden, so that if you were down on your luck you could glean a few leaves."
	
The decaying old wall is scenery in Patriotic Chard-Garden. The description is "This part of it is not really picturesque: just old rocks, a few of which occasionally shift loose and fall away."

Instead of climbing on the decaying old wall:
	say "It's not in the best of shape. It wouldn't be hard to become part of a minor rockfall and kill ourselves on the descent."

A chard is in Patriotic Chard-Garden. It is a vegetable. "A little [chard] still grows in the nearest bed, carefully tended to thrive in this climate." The indefinite article of the chard is "some".

Report taking the chard when the chard is not handled:
	say "We pick the chard, leaving bare soil behind.
		
A flicker of curtains from inside the house suggests that someone saw us [--] a cleaner, possibly. But then there is a voice, not audible except as a confident rising and falling tone; this will be my mother, saying not to worry and not to interfere." instead.

A soil is a fixed in place thing in the Patriotic Chard-Garden. The indefinite article is "some". "At our feet is a patch of [soil]." 
	Understand "ground" or "earth" or "soil" as the soil.
	The description is "Bare dirt[if the chard is not in the location and the location is the Patriotic Chard-Garden], revealed when the chard was cleared away[otherwise], looking somewhat out of place here[end if]." 
	The soil is diggable.

Instead of taking the soil when the soil is in the location:
	say "It's more than [you] can carry around by the handful."

[Every turn when the player carries the dirt:
	move the dirt to the location;
	say "The dirt is more than we can contain, and spills out onto the ground instead." ]

Before doing something when the current action involves the soil and the chard is in the location:
	say "The soil is hard to see under the chard." instead.

A description-concealing rule when the soil is marked for listing:
	if the chard is in the location, now the soil is not marked for listing.

The house-wall is scenery in Patriotic Chard-Garden. Understand "house" or "flicker" or "curtains" or "curtain" or "window" or "windows" or "wall" as the house-wall.

Section 4 - Roget Close

Roget Close is west of Webster Court. "A pleasantly sheltered lane in which I learned to ride a bicycle, and where my friend Lucy used to live, before she and her parents moved off-island. Restrictions were looser even twenty years ago. Our old [schoolhouse] is just west of here." 
	 
[Instead of looking in Roget Close when Private Beach is visited and lexicon-tick is 0:
	do nothing instead.]

Instead of going west in Roget Close:
	say "School is out for the holiday. [run paragraph on]";
	carry out the listing exits activity.

The schoolhouse is a facade in Roget Close. It fronts west. It is scenery. Understand "school" or "elementary" or "building" or "big" or "arched" or "windows" or "faded" or "floorboards" or "yard" or "schoolyard" as the schoolhouse. The description is "[one of]It's where I went to school until I was twelve, as did most of the kids in this area. It's an old building with big arched windows and faded floorboards, and in the afternoon the schoolyard smells of spilled milk going sour in the sun. [or][stopping]From this direction there's not much to see but the screen of palm trees in front." 

Some handsome old houses are a backdrop. They are in Hesychius Street and Roget Close. They are scenery. They screen south. The description is "Many of them built in the mid- or late 19th century, the houses are designed for families with a number of servants. Some of the owners even continue to keep up establishments on that scale." Understand "villas" as the handsome old houses.

Some palm trees are scenery in Roget Close. Understand "screen" or "palms" as the palm trees. The description is "They aren't the very tall and graceful kind, but a stumpier variety, forming a sort of vegetative colonnade in front of the school building[if the gum is in the location and the gum is not handled]. There's some [gum] stuck to the base of the nearest tree[end if]."

Instead of climbing palm trees:
	say "Were you good at pole climbing exercises in gym? Because I wasn't."
	
[Because it requires several levels of examination, it's likely that many players will miss the gum entirely -- which is fine, because there are several other, more prominent solutions to the spinner puzzle. The aim here is to provide a reward to people whose first instinct is deep rather than broad exploration when they're faced with a new puzzle. 

Once they *have* seen the gum, it becomes more prominently visible in the room description to hint that they could interact with it if they want.]
	
The gum is in Roget Close. It is edible. The heft of the gum is 1. The indefinite article is "some". "Gum adheres to one of the palm trees, left no doubt by some departing school kid." The description is "The lump of blue-green gum has largely dried, but is still intensely unappetizing."
	The scent-description is "spearmint".
	Understand "lump" or "blue-green" as the gum.

Sanity-check eating the gum:
	say "I'm afraid I've never cared for ABC gum." instead.
	
Sanity-check tasting the gum:
	say "I'm afraid I've never cared for ABC gum." instead.
	
A description-concealing rule when the gum is marked for listing:
	if the gum is not handled and the gum is not seen:
		now the gum is not marked for listing.

Rule for listing exits  while looking in Roget Close:
	do nothing instead.
	
After going from Roget Close to the Winding Footpath:
	let N be the number of entries in the described motion of the player;
	if N is greater than 0:
		say "[You] walk through the wealthy neighb[our]hood to Roget Close. ";
	clear path-walked for the player;
	increase path description count by 1;
	say "[if N is greater than 0]There [you][otherwise][You][end if] slip between the houses and down a path that looks as though it might lead to someone's back yard. No one has ever put up signage to correct this misapprehension because no one who lives around here is eager to encourage strangers on the private beach.
	
Soon, however, the footpath begins to descend purposefully towards the level of the ocean[if the location is the final destination].[otherwise].[paragraph break][end if]";
	continue the action;
	
Section 5 - Winding Footpath

The spinner-gate is north of Roget Close.  It is a closed locked door. The printed name of the spinner-gate is "gate". Understand "gate" as the spinner-gate. "If you look just north between the houses, you'll notice also the footpath down to an almost-private beach. It used to be open, but it's now gated off, and built into the [spinner-gate] is a chic modern sculpture." 

The description of the spinner-gate is "A gate of wrought iron bars between two sturdy columns[if the spinner-gate is closed and the spinner-gate is locked], too close to climb through and too tall to climb over[else if the spinner-gate is closed], closed but not locked[else if the spinner-gate is open]; at the moment the gate has been pushed conveniently open[end if]. Built into the right-hand column, next to the gate latch, is a curious sculpture."

Through spinner-gate is the Winding Footpath. South of Winding Footpath is Roget Close.

Winding Footpath is an outdoors room. "The [underfoot-path] winds between the villas, sloping steeply downward. It is narrow, and [bushes] left and right conceal it even from the windows of the people living nearby." Understand "path" as Winding Footpath.

Instead of going down in Winding Footpath:
	try going north.
	
Instead of going up in Winding Footpath:
	try going south.
	
Report facing in Winding Footpath:
	say "The steep sides of the path and the heavy growth of bushes make it hard to see far." instead.

Rule for listing exits when looking in Winding Footpath:
	do nothing instead.

Some bushes are scenery in Winding Footpath. The description is "Some variety I'm not familiar with: dark glossy green leaves, thick stems. In the right season, and I can't even remember what season that is, they also grow gaudy pink flowers. But not now[if kudzu is part of the bushes]. Lots of [kudzu] grows through and over the bushes [--] this is one of the few spots on the island where it hasn't been eradicated, it seems[end if].

[if the bushes are shrine-hiding]At one point along the path the bushes stick out especially far, as though there's something behind them.[otherwise]The bushes part a little to reveal the [shrine] [you] found.[end if]". Understand "dark" or "glossy" or "green" or "leaves" or "gaudy" or "pink" as the bushes.

The kudzu is part of the bushes. The indefinite article is "some". Understand "invasive" or "vines" or "vine" as the kudzu. The description of the kudzu is "An invasive vine grown through and over the bushes."

Test foilkudzubug with "cut kudzu with foil" holding the foil in the Winding Footpath.

Carry out cutting the kudzu with something:
	remove the kudzu from play.

Report cutting the kudzu with the jigsaw:
	say "The jigsaw is not an ideal tool for kudzu removal and [you] wind up making a bit of a mess with bits of bush, but we do enough damage to clear the stage a bit." instead.

Report cutting the kudzu with the sword:
	say "A sword is not a machete, a fact that [you] have reason to ponder at some length. At least it's not a heavy broadsword. Our arm is not nearly strong enough to wield one of those. Even this blade gets tiring to wield surprisingly quickly.
	
After a long time and a lot of bother, [you] manage to lop off the main kudzu bits." instead.
	

The bushes can be shrine-hiding or shrine-revealing. The bushes are shrine-hiding.

Setting action variables for searching or looking under the kudzu:
	change the noun to the bushes.

Instead of searching or looking under the bushes:
	if the kudzu is part of the bushes:
		say "It's hard to get a good look under the bushes with all this kudzu in the way." instead;
	if the bushes are shrine-hiding:
		say "Hunting behind the bushes reveals something I vaguely remember seeing when I was a child, but not noticing again since: built into the wall is what looks like a very ancient sort of shrine.";
		now the bushes are shrine-revealing;
	otherwise:
		say "There's nothing more to find, really."

Instead of waving the letter-remover at the shrine:
	say "It won't do any good, you see: this is an [if the player is wearing britishizing goggles]artefact[otherwise]artifact[end if] of another time and language, and it has never been neutral[ize]d by authorities, so it won't respond to English-language tools. Quite likely it's in a language so old that it can't be manipulated at all.

I wonder why it hasn't been removed, or fixed; but I'd guess the reason is that very few people come this way."
	
Instead of waving the letter-remover at something which is part of the shrine:
	try waving the letter-remover at the shrine.

A description-concealing rule:
	if the bushes are shrine-hiding:
		now the shrine is not marked for listing.
		
Instead of pushing or pulling or turning the shrine:
	say "The backing stone is built firmly into the wall."
	
Sanity-check doing something when the bushes are shrine-hiding:
	if the noun is the shrine or the second noun is the shrine:
		say "Now that you mention it, I do vaguely recall something about a shrine in this area, but [you] can't make it out under the [bushes] right now." instead.

[The nymph 'shrine' is nod to the island's Roman history. There's nothing in the game to reveal this, really, but the idea is that this stone is actually a panel from an imperial-era sarcophagus (nymphs were often featured on such panels, and sarcophagus carvers were of very varied levels of skill). Subsequent inhabitants moved it.]

The shrine is a fixed in place container in the Winding Footpath. "Now that the bushes have been cleared a little, the ancient shrine is plainly visible[if something is in the shrine], and [a random thing in the shrine] [is-are] set up in the place of hon[our][end if]." Understand "ancient" or "wall" or "niche" or "stone" or "backing" as the shrine. The description of the shrine is "There's a niche dug into the stone of the wall, above a [low relief] of three ladies. It's not very good work to start with, and has been eroded by a lot of weather, and I wouldn't be surprised if this weren't its original location; it probably stood somewhere else and was brought here.".

The carrying capacity of the shrine is 1.

Sanity-check inserting something into the shrine:
	if the heft of the noun is greater than 2:
		say "[The noun] [is-are] too large to fit in the shrine niche." instead.
		
Sanity-check putting something on the shrine:
	try inserting the noun into the shrine instead.

[The shrine is an easter egg to begin with; but easter eggs are the most fun if they are toys as well. The shrine offers the opportunity for some expressive play, as the player can try inserting different items. Mostly it's up to the player to roll his own meanings for this, but there are special responses for a few of the most pointed donations.]

Report inserting the as into the shrine:
	say "[You] set [the noun] in the shrine, as though to leave a small offering for whatever deities these were." instead.

Report inserting the members into the shrine:
	say "The set of members just barely fits into the shrine. They look odd and plastic against the rough stone." instead.

Report inserting the army into the shrine:
	say "The figures of the soldiers form a neat line in the shrine niche. It looks as though a child had come here to play." instead.

Report inserting the cross into the shrine:
	say "[You] appropriate the ancient pagan shrine for a more Christian purpose, as many others must have done here when Atlantis was first converted in the fourth century." instead.

Report inserting the Guidebook into the shrine:
	say "[You] set [the noun] down in the niche. A pointed gesture, that: this shrine is just one of the many things around the island that the [i]Guidebook[/i] does not, and cannot, acknowledge." instead.

Report inserting a pi-object into the shrine:
	say "[You] set [the noun] in the niche, where it gleams in crisp and perfect contrast to the old and battered superstitious monument. Pure and eternal mathematics, exalted by the frail hand of man; or something like that." instead.
		
Report inserting the roll of bills into the shrine:
	say "[You] set up a cult to cash and contemplate it for a minute. There's no one else around to appreciate the point, though, and we need the money, so it will have to be a temporary installation only." instead.

Report inserting a sin into the shrine:
	say "[You] arrange [the noun] in the shrine niche, as some sort of ironic statement about what people worship these days." instead.

Report inserting the dog into the shrine:
	say "[You] stick the dog into the shrine niche. The effect is a bit sinister." instead.

Report inserting the god into the shrine:
	say "[You] stand the god up in the niche in a place of solemn hon[our]. It fits perfectly, as though shaped for just this use.
	
For a moment, with the air still and hot, and no one visible in any direction, we might almost believe that the past two millennia have been nothing, and that the shrine is fresh and new.

But Anglophone Atlantis prefers to forget what it was.";
	record "Jocasta Higgate award for reconstructing pagan worship on the island" as an achievement instead.

Report inserting something into the shrine:
	say "[You] give [the noun] a place of solemn hon[our] above the relief of frolicking ladies." instead.

The low relief is a part of the shrine. Understand "ladies" or "three" or "waves" or "surface" or "nymph" or "nymphs" or "bare" or "breasts" or "breast" or "garment" or "garments" or "carving" or "sculpture" or "sculpted" as the low relief.  The description is "It looks like three ladies dancing on the surface of waves. They're probably meant to be nymphs, if I had to guess. They have bare breasts and fluttering garments, but the carving was done by someone who has not the slightest idea how to make limbs appear under sculpted cloth, so it all looks clunky, as though they don't have hips or legs at all, just randomly swirling skirts as their lower halves.

All the same, there's something appealing about it."

After going from the Winding Footpath to the Private Beach:
	let N be the number of entries in the path so far of the player;
	if N is greater than 1:
		say "[path-walked so far]";
	otherwise if N is 1: 
		clear path-walked for player;
	increase path description count by 1;
	say "[You] continue down until there is a chink of a view of the sea. Then the path descends through a few last hairpin twists among rocks, and comes out suddenly on a little beach[if N is greater than 1].[paragraph break][otherwise if N is 1].[otherwise].[end if]";
	continue the action.
	
Test pathbug with "wear monocle / x path" holding the monocle in Winding Footpath.

underfoot-path is a privately-named improper-named scenery thing in Winding Footpath. The printed name is "footpath". Understand "path" or "footpath" or "pathway" as underfoot-path. The description is "There are traces of sand on the pathway, tracked up from the beach."

Instead of climbing underfoot-path:
	try going south.
	
Test shrine with "tutorial off / autoupgrade / wave z-remover at kudzu / look behind bushes / put god in shrine / look / get god / wave a-remover at pita / wave t-remover at pit / put pi in shrine / look / get pi / put bills in shrine / look / get bills / put as in shrine / look / get as / put cross in shrine / look / get cross / put army in shrine / look / get army / put members in shrine / look / get members / wave s-remover at members / put member in shrine / look /  get member / wave g-remover at sign / put sin in shrine / look / get sin / put guidebook in shrine / look / get guidebook" holding the god and the pita and the roll of bills and the as and the cross and the army and the members and the yellow sign and the Guidebook in the Winding Footpath.
	
Section 6 - The Beach

Private Beach is north of Winding Footpath. "This is little more than a strip of fine yellow [sand], perhaps twenty me[ter]s from side to side, and five from the [hillside] to the waterline[if the sage is in the location and the sage is not handled]. A little [sage] grows on the hillside, escaped from some garden, along with wilder plants[end if]. Above, at the top of that slope, are houses with balconies overlooking the sea, but from this angle it's impossible to see much of them, or for them (you'll have to take my word on this) to see us[if high street is visited and roundabout is not visited].

It's tempting to look for crabs among the rocks, but the tide is high just now, and even at the best of times this is not an area rich in sealife[end if]."

Understand "look for crabs" or "search for crabs" or "find crabs" or "catch crabs" as a mistake ("There aren't likely to be any, is the point.") when the player is in Private Beach.

The hillside is a facade in Private Beach. It is scenery. It fronts west. "The [hillside] both east and west runs steeply down into the water [--] much too steep to allow for beaches or buildings. Here and there some bit of plant life has managed to cling onto the rock, but mostly it is bare and rough." Understand "hill" or "slope" or "plant life" or "plants" as the hillside.
	The closure notice is "That way is just bare hillside, much too steep to climb. ".

Instead of facing east in Private Beach:
	try examining the hillside.
	
The sage is in Private Beach. The indefinite article is "some". The scent-description is "pleasant herbs". The description of the sage is "Dark green leaves furred with silver prickles." The sage is a vegetable.

A description-concealing rule:
	if the sage is not handled:
		now the sage is not marked for listing. 

The sandcastle is fixed in place in Private Beach. "A fragile [sandcastle] stands near the water's edge." The sandcastle can be built or unbuilt. The sandcastle is unbuilt. The description is "[if unbuilt]At the edge of the water the sand is disturbed just enough to suggest where a previous sandcastle might have been, but that is all.[otherwise]No more than a couple of cylindrical turrets and a protective wall.[end if]". Understand "turret" or "turrets" or "wall" or "cylindrical" or "protective wall" or "cylinder" or "cylinders" or "castle" or "sand castle" or "sand-castle" or "palace" or "fort" or "fortress" or "project" as the sandcastle.

The scent-description is "salt and seaweed".

Instead of touching the sandcastle:
	say "[one of]Delicately [you] trace a few more crenellations in the top of the castle wall.[or][You] smoothe down one of the turrets.[or][You] poke a little door into the base of one of the turrets.[or][You] draw in some windows with our pinky.[at random]".

A description-concealing rule:
	if the sandcastle is unbuilt:
		now the sandcastle is not marked for listing. 

Understand "build [sandcastle]" or "rebuild [sandcastle]" or "make [sandcastle]" or "construct [sandcastle]" or "reconstruct [sandcastle]" as building.

Instead of attacking the sandcastle:
	now the sandcastle is unbuilt;
	say "With a few vigorous swipes [you] demolish the construction."
	
Instead of building the sandcastle more than once:
	say "It would be pleasant to make believe that we were young and had no other concerns but to sit on the beach and make castles. But we both know that's not the case."

Building is an action applying to one thing.

Check building: 
	if the sandcastle is built:
		say "There isn't time to build an entire sand-city." instead.

Carry out building:
	let N be a random number between 3 and 10;
	sandcastle washes away in N turns from now;
	now the sandcastle is built.
	
Report building:
	say "It would be madness to spend long on such projects when [you] have so much else to be doing, but [you] do, for old times['] sake (mine, at least), construct a couple of hasty cylindrical turrets and a protective wall of sorts."

At the time when sandcastle washes away:
	if the sandcastle is unbuilt and the player can see the sandcastle:
		say "The waves wash away all but the faintest traces of the sandcastle.";
	otherwise if the player can see the sandcastle:
		say "[if the noun is the sandcastle or the second noun is the sandcastle]But our efforts are in vain, because an[otherwise]An[end if] especially forward wave slides up the beach and demolishes [if the noun is the sandcastle or the second noun is the sandcastle]the whole construction[otherwise]our poor sandcastle[end if].";
	now the sandcastle is unbuilt;
		
Test sandcastle with "x castle / build castle / build sandcastle / look / smell castle / taste castle / touch castle / x castle / z".

The sand is scenery in Private Beach. Understand "ground" as the sand. The description is "It's baking hot." The indefinite article is "some". The sand is diggable.

Instead of taking the sand:
	say "Sure, [you] could wander off with a handful of sand, but [you] could hardly shift any significant portion of the beach. And then we'd be making a mess and dribbling sand grains everywhere."

Test funnelbug with "tutorial off / hard / y / dig / dig sand" in the Beach.

After digging in the sand when the funnel is buried:
	now the funnel is not buried;
	say "[You] brush away the sand covering a [funnel], left over from some child's building project."

Report digging in the sand:
	say "Scooping away a few handfuls of sand reveals nothing extraordinary, just more sand." instead.
	
Instead of touching the sand:
	say "[You] run our fingers through the fine sand, raking it into patterns."

Instead of inserting the sand into the funnel:
	say "[You] scoop a little sand, but it only runs out again."
	
Instead of inserting the sea-view into the funnel:
	say "The water fills the funnel and then runs out again in a decorative drizzle on the sand. A moment later even that is gone in the heat of the day."

A funnel is a thing in the Private Beach. "[if the funnel is buried]Something green and plastic just barely pokes out of the sand[otherwise]Half-hidden in the sand, no doubt left over from some kid's sandcastle project, is a plastic funnel[end if]." The description is "A gaudy green plastic toy suitable for funneling water and shaping conical sand-turrets. [if handled]A few grains of sand still cling to it[otherwise]It's all sandy[end if]." The scent-description is "warm plastic".
	Understand "green" or "plastic" or "toy" or "gaudy" as the funnel.
	
Instead of examining the buried funnel:
	say "All that's visible from here is the tip of something green."

Carry out taking the funnel: 
	now the funnel is not buried.

The funnel can be buried or unburied. The funnel is buried.

Sanity-check rubbing the sand when the funnel is buried:
	try digging in the sand instead.
	
Sanity-check inserting the funnel into the fountain:
	try washing the funnel instead.

Instead of washing the funnel in the presence of the fountain:
	say "We dip the funnel in the water and quickly shake it dry.";
	now the description of the funnel is "A gaudy green plastic toy suitable for funneling water and shaping conical sand-turrets."
	
Instead of  washing the funnel when the player can touch a sink (called target sink):
	now the description of the funnel is "A gaudy green plastic toy suitable for funneling water and shaping conical sand-turrets.";
	say "[You] run some water from [the target sink] over [the funnel], leaving it glistening and clean." instead.

Instead of rubbing the funnel:

Instead of wearing the funnel:
	say "I try setting it on our head as a cap, but it slides off again."

Instead of searching the funnel:
	say "It restricts our view comically, as though [you] were peering through a doll's periscope. But the utility is limited."

Rule for listing exits when the location is Private Beach:
	say "This little bit of sand ends on either side in steep rockfalls; there's no way to work along the coast in either direction. The only way to go is back up the footpath to the south."
	
Test funnel with "tutorial off / look / x funnel / dig in sand / look / x funnel / get funnel / clean funnel / look in funnel / wear funnel" in Private Beach.
Test funnel1 with "drop funnel / take funnel / wash funnel / fill funnel with water / wave p-remover at apple / fill funnel with ale / put funnel in water / put funnel in fountain" holding the funnel and the apple in Park Center.
Test funnel2 with "drop funnel / take funnel /wash funnel / put funnel in water / put funnel in sink" holding the funnel in My Apartment.
	
Instead of going up when the location is Private Beach:

Part 1 - Secrets and Concealments

Chapter 1 - The Fish Area

Section 1 - Deep Street

[The mixed architecture of Deep Street is an echo of the dreamlike buildings I once saw in the French seaside town of Cerbère, on the Mediterranean just across the border from Spain.]

Deep Street is a proper-named road. "This road descends steeply from [southwest] to [northwest], passing between [white concrete buildings] to provide access to the marina [--] the Fish Market, the Docks, and a bar or two. The street is in deep shadow, protected from sunlight from almost any angle by its narrowness and by the height of the walls."

Instead of going southeast in Deep Street:
	say "The [Post Office] is of course shut down for the holiday."

The Post Office is a facade in Deep Street. It fronts southeast. It is scenery. Understand "postoffice" as the Post Office. The description is "Postal service on the island is easy [--] no one lives very far from anyone else, after all [--] but very necessary considering the limited uses of internet and telephones. This building is the one in which mail from the outside world is processed before being sent on, and is consequently a bit grander than most."

The convenience store is a facade in Deep Street. It fronts northeast. It is scenery. Understand "shop" or "grocery" as the convenience store. The description is "During normal business hours, it sells the usual assortment: sandwiches, cold drinks, bus tickets, recharge packets for letter tools, disposable cameras. Currently it is shut, however."

The white concrete buildings are scenery in Deep Street. Instead of entering the white concrete buildings, say "They're all private apartments, run down but nevertheless expensive on the grounds of location alone." The description of the white concrete buildings is "Each has its [balcony] and its [laundry] flapping on clothes lines; but there the uniformity ends. Some are decorated in a curious fantasia of [painted Moorish patterns]; others a daring kind of art nouveau, all organic curves and windows that glance out under lowered concrete lids." 

The painted Moorish patterns are part of the white concrete buildings. The description is "Black, gold, rose and red, they mark out arches and stripe eaves."

The balcony is part of the buildings. Understand "balconies" as the balcony. Instead of climbing the balcony, say "The lowest is still many feet above the sidewalk level." The description of the balcony is "Many are rounded, like boxes at the opera."

The laundry is part of the balcony. The description is "Mostly bleached t-shirts and underpants and the odd sheet pinned to a line." Understand "clothes" or "lines" or "line" or "underpants" or "odd" or "sheet" or "t-shirts" or "bleached" as the laundry.


	
	[say "Then [you] turn south across a lane of traffic. One guy honks and another makes a gesture that doesn't actually apply to us in our current anatomy. There are protesters here, too [--] lots of them.

As we move down the street, we can see police with riot gear starting to cut off side exits, containing the protest. 

A woman on the curb bangs on the hood of our car. 'You! You're guilty!' she says, pointing at us.

I nearly have a heart attack, but she pulls back. 'We are [i]all[/i] guilty!' shouts the voice. 'If we really objected to what is done in our name, we would storm the Bureau[--]'";
	wait for any key;
	say "[paragraph break]There's a bright light and a catastrophic bang and world goes eerily silent. The protesters are gone. The cars on the street are still moving, slowly.

A policeman in blue is cuffing a single old woman in a Not Guilty shirt. Her eyes meet ours. They're wild with fury and fear and simple madness.

And that, my friend, is why civil disobedience doesn't tend to work around here. We've just seen a depluralization.";
	remove protesters from play;
	wait for any key. ]
	

Deep Street is northeast of Roundabout.

A description-concealing rule:
	if Counterfeit Monkey is unvisited:
		now aquarium-exterior is not marked for listing.
	
aquarium-exterior is a facade in Deep Street. It fronts east. The printed name is "Aquarium Bookstore". Understand "aquarium" or "shop" or "window" or "bookstore" or "store" as aquarium-exterior. "[The Aquarium] is to the east." The introduction is "It is an esoteric bookstore (and purveyor of other things), but one whose owner has helped you in the past[if the player knows lena-needed and aquarium is not visited]. That would be Lena, the woman that [you] need to talk to about Slango[end if]."
	The description is "[if Aquarium is visited]The outside manages to give an impression of poverty, gloom, and probable drug use; though, having seen the inside, I am going to guess that the real issues are sloth and kookiness[otherwise]I've never been inside the Aquarium: the outside never looked terribly savory. Perhaps that's the point[end if]."
	
Rule for writing a topic sentence about aquarium-exterior when aquarium-exterior is not as-yet-unknown:
	say "[The Aquarium] is to the east. [if aquarium-closed-sign is visible]There's a closed sign in the window and a forbidding atmosphere[otherwise]It's dim inside, but occasional movements suggest that the proprietor, Slango's friend Lena, is inside[end if]. ";
	
A ranking rule when aquarium-exterior is not as-yet-unknown and Aquarium is visited and a car (called target) is in the location:
	increase description-rank of the target by 20.
	
Rule for writing a topic sentence about the car (called target car) when the location is Deep Street and Aquarium is visited and aquarium-exterior is not as-yet-unknown and aquarium-exterior is mentionable:
	say "Our pathetic little [target car] is parked right outside [the aquarium-exterior]. "

Instead of searching aquarium-exterior:
	if the aquarium-closed-sign is visible:
		say "Now that the shade is down, it's impossible to see inside.";
	otherwise:
		say "The interior of the shop is so much dimmer than the outside that it's hard to get a good look inside, but from the occasional signs of movement, I think Slango's friend Lena is in there."

Before going to the Aquarium when the Counterfeit Monkey is unvisited:
	say "I'm sure that would be interesting under other circumstances, but [you] have an appointment to keep." instead.
	
Before approaching the Aquarium when the Counterfeit Monkey is unvisited:
	say "I'm sure that would be interesting under other circumstances, but [you] have an appointment to keep." instead.


Before going to the Aquarium when player can see the aquarium-closed-sign:
	say "[rejection-from-aquarium]" instead.
	
Before approaching the Aquarium when the aquarium-closed-sign:
	say "[rejection-from-aquarium]" instead.

To say rejection-from-aquarium:
	say "[one of]Lena has rolled down the shades and put up the closed sign.[or]I try tapping on the door, but Lena calls from inside, 'Go away, we're closed!'[or]'I'm napping!' yells Lena from an upper room. 'Go away!'[or][You] knock again. No good.[stopping]"
	
The aquarium-closed-sign is a privately-named thing. The printed name is "closed sign". Understand "closed" or "sign" or "shades" or "shade" or "red" or "placard" or "white lettering" or "lettering" as the aquarium-closed-sign. The description is "The shades have been rolled down over the Aquarium window, and a red placard with white lettering announces that the shop is closed."

After going from the Aquarium when Slango is in the Counterfeit Monkey:
	say "'This would be a good time to stop for lunch and a little siesta,' says Lena, following us to the door. As we go out, she's rolling down the shades and putting up a closed sign.";
	move the single ream to the repository;
	move the odes-book to the repository; [The ream object actually does double-duty and will reappear when we need to fix the printer.]
	now the aquarium-closed-sign is part of the aquarium-exterior;
	continue the action.

Section 2 - The Aquarium

The Aquarium Bookstore is east of Deep Street. It is a privately-controlled room. It is indoors. The description is "The shop takes its name from the [collection of fish] mounted on every wall: swordfish, bass, other things I don't recogn[ize]. Underneath these dubious tokens, the walls are covered with bookshelves, and there are stacks of books on the floor where the shelves have proven insufficient."

The aquarium-shelving is scenery in the aquarium. Understand "shelves" or "bookshelves" or "shelving" as the aquarium-shelving. The printed name is "shelving". The description is "They're completely crammed with books."

The collection of fish is scenery in the Aquarium. Understand "swordfish" or "bass" as the collection of fish. The description is "None of the fish has been dusted in the last decade. The collection presents a slightly mournful air."

Understand "browse [merchandise]" as searching.

Test merch with "browse / browse merchandise / x merchandise / look at merchandise / g / g / g" in Aquarium bookstore.

Instead of searching the aquarium-shelving:
	try searching the merchandise.
	
A ranking rule for the merchandise:
	increase the description-rank of the merchandise by 50.

The merchandise is fixed in place in the aquarium. "The merchandise consists mainly, but not exclusively, of books, and the selection caters to odd tastes." 
	The introduction is "You once picked up in here a book about a man who R-removed a wrench, and then had his way with it. You and Brock had a good time with that one for the next month and a half."
	Understand "books" or "book" or "stack" or "stacks" or "grandfather clock" or "grandfather" or "his gray lover" or "seventy ways to disable an authentication scope" or "ways to disable" or "seventy" or "stack/stacks of books" as the merchandise.
	The description is "Our eyes scan over the merchandise and pick out [one of][a random thing which is part of the merchandise][or][a random number between 2 and 7 in words] copies of [a random thing which is part of the merchandise][at random][one of][or] inexplicably filed under '[one-genre]'[as decreasingly likely outcomes]."
	
Instead of searching the merchandise, try examining the merchandise.
	
[ The books at the shop exist to partially explain, justify, and lightly hint other aspects of the game world. I don't anticipate that all players will have sufficient interest to look at all of them, but someone who is bored or stuck or just a thorough explorer may do so. 

The Ba's Journey hints that the word "ba" is known in Atlantis, so the BALL > BA > BAT chain is possible. Quagmire Manifesto explains a bit of the background for the film reel easter egg. Indian Summer and The Queen's English hint at the almost sexual fascination some Atlanteans have with foreign words.

Pat and Chris drops in a bit of Atlantean sexual politics that there otherwise isn't a great deal of space to explore, namely that people tend to be more open to gender reassignment because it can be done so cheaply and reversibly with Atlantean technology. While Alex personally is uncomfortable being manifested in a female body, the idea is not as culturally alien to him as it might be to many others.

Dyslexic Coalition reflects some of the downside: learning disabilities that might be regarded purely as a misfortune in another culture are more strongly and unsympathetically stigmatized in Atlantis. ]

Ba's Journey is a book. It is part of the merchandise. The description is "This is a bit of popular new age self-help from the early 80s, combining Atlantean mystical ideas about Egypt with modern popular psychology to create an allegory about the formation and development of the person over the course of a lifetime."

Quagmire Manifesto is a book. It is part of the merchandise. The description is "Written by the implausibly-named Lucius Quagmire, the Manifesto suggests film-making, especially wordless or foreign-language film-making, as a route to undermining the Anglophone hegemony and 'restoring Atlantis to the community of the world.' It's full of stuff about 'disrupting the simple significance of words' by building up complex and multivalent metaphorical associations; connotation as more powerful than denotation; thought as triumphant over word."

The Queen's English is a book. It is proper-named. It is part of the merchandise. The description is "It's a history of the subversive community on Atlantis who resisted adopting Webster's reforms and continued to promote traditional British spelling on the island even up to the beginning of the 20th century.

A cursory examination shows that the book's previous owner went through with a highlighter and tinted pink all the British spelling examples."

Pat-Chris is a book. It is part of the merchandise. The printed name is "Pat and Chris and the Homonym Paddle". Understand "Pat" or "Chris" or "and" or "the" or "homonym" or "paddle" as Pat-chris.
	The description is "A dog-eared old classic of Atlantean transgender literature, in which the protagonists try out the combinatorics of gender identities. Four decades on, it reads as pure camp, but it speaks (if clumsily) to an era where these things were still surprising."

Dyslexic Coalition is a book. It is part of the merchandise. The description is "It's a handbook and guide for people struggling with dyslexia and their families and friends who may be affected."
	
[The concept and text of Indian Summer are Graham's; he felt there needed to be a little more linguistic seediness about the dock areas.]
	
Indian Summer is part of the merchandise. It is a book. The description is "It's one of those risqué novels full of loan words. Example:

[i]Glowing, Jocasta peeled off her jodhpurs, donned pajamas, and strode out onto the verandah for a tiffin. The polo match at the gymkhana, now in full swing, overpowered her, and she mopped her brow with a calico bandanna. 'I am just perfectly doolally this afternoon,' she murmured, licking her lips as she admired the riders forming up for first chukka.

She hardly minded the little bandicoot's chicanery, the jar of chutney upended all over the teapoy. It had gone in the kedgeree, it had gone in the mulligatawny. 'You little thug,' Jocasta whispered, 'now I'll have to shampoo my crimson pashmina,' but she fed him some candy, then fondly watched him crash through the banyan like a juggernaut, dodging an anaconda. There was a crack! as the Earl of Arbroathshire, a captain in the 51st Lancers, swung his mallet. 'Oh my swami, my guru,' sang Jocasta to herself, dreaming of her bungalow up-country where once he...[/i]

Sorry, I have to stop. This is making me a little uncomfortable."

Instead of taking something which is part of the merchandise:
	say "This is assuredly not the time for a little light shopping.".

Instead of pushing or pulling or turning the merchandise:
	say "[You] nudge one of the nearest stacks until it is more neatly arranged against the shelf. Less likely to fall over that way."

The contraband box is a container. The contraband box contains some modems and some preamps. The description of the contraband box is "It's just a cardboard box in which some items of interest have been stored."
	The introduction is "Lena apparently wants our help getting them into a less identifiable format."

The description of the preamps is "They aren't in themselves restricted technology, but Atlantean government slaps a very high tariff on any kind of electronic device not manufactured on the island. This is especially annoying and needless in the case of audio equipment for which there is no local manufacturer."

The description of the modems is "If Brock were here, he would know exactly what made these interesting and valuable. All you can guess is that they're not a form approved by the government."

Section 3 - Lena 

Lena is an alert woman in the Aquarium. "[one of][Lena] is present, all right. In fact she watches us keenly the instant [you] come into the shop.[or][Lena] hovers, unwilling to let us look around ungoverned[if the contraband box is mentionable and the contraband box contains something]. At her feet is [a contraband box] containing [a list of things in the contraband box][end if].[stopping]".
	The introduction is "[Lena] is an associate of Slango's. You hadn't realized that had crossed over into a romance. Slango has never, ever in your recollection dated anyone. And now this."
	The description is "She has grey hair in a curly cloud around her head, and she wears a [long patchwork skirt] and [leather sandals]. But her eyes are keen."
	Lena wears a long patchwork skirt and some leather sandals. The description of the leather sandals is "The sort of sturdy comfortable sandals one can walk in for hours." 
	The description of the long patchwork skirt is "It falls to Lena's ankles even though it has been rolled over several times at the waistband. The fabric is mostly scraps of silver and grey and dark blue, but there are here and there some odd sports in other col[our]s." Understand "fabric" or "scraps" or "silver" or "grey" or "blue" or "dark blue" or "waistband" or "waist" or "ankles" as the long patchwork skirt.
	
Instead of putting the restoration gel on the odes-book in the presence of Lena:
	say "'Hey,' she says. 'I like that how it is.'"

Instead of putting the restoration gel on the ream in the presence of Lena:
	say "'No, leave that,' she says. 'That's a good disguise.'"
	
Carry out putting the restoration gel on something disguisable in the presence of Lena:
	casually queue back-to-start.
	
Definition: a thing is disguisable:
	if it is the modems:
		yes;
	if it is the preamps:
		yes;
	if it is proffered by the modems:
		yes;
	if it is proffered by  the preamps:
		yes;
	no.

Instead of taking the contraband box:
	say "I don't think her plans for that included our stealing it."
	
Instead of taking something disguisable:
	say "'You can't have [the noun],' Lena says. 'Just do whatever you think needs doing to... improve [it-them] a bit.'"

Instead of putting the paste on something in the presence of Lena:
	say "[You] smear some of [the paste] onto [the second noun]. Nothing obvious happens, of course, but that is the whole point.";
	now the second noun is disguised;
	casually queue excellent-work.

Section 4 - The Fish Market

[Inspired by a similar area in Marseilles and a few images from Nice.]

The Fish Market is northwest of Deep Street. The description is "Not very fishy at the moment, in fact: all the real trade happens in the early morning; then there is a period of tourist trade when the seafood sale tails off and most of the purchases are of polished conch shells and starfish; and then a little after noon the area clears out completely, leaving only briny rivulets on the concrete."

Rule for listing exits when the location is Fish Market and the Authenticator is in the location:
	do nothing instead.

After going to Fish Market when the authenticator is in Fish Market and the player is hurrying:
	let N be the number of entries in the path so far of the player;
	if N is greater than 1: 
		say "[path-walked so far]";
	otherwise:
		clear the path-walked for the player;   
	now approach-destination is Samuel Johnson Hall; [make it seem like we haven't made progress, if approaching.] 
	[try going east]. 

Definition: a thing is problematic:
	if it is illegal:
		yes;
	if it is proffered by an illegal thing:
		yes;
	no.
	
Sanity-check dropping the plans in the Tin Hut:
	say "It doesn't feel safe leaving the plans here even for a short period." instead.
	
Test tinhut with "n / e / drop plans / w / wave l-remover at plans / wave s-remover at plan" in Deep Street holding the plans.

Before going to the Fish Market from the Tin Hut:  
	if the Authenticator is not in Fish Market:
		continue the action;
	if the player encloses the plans and the plans are not in the closed backpack:
		say "I don't think [you] want to show off the plans around the Authenticator." instead; 
	remove Authenticator from play;
	say "I don't think there's anything showing that should get us into trouble. Timidly I open the door; the Authenticator has her back to us. [You] slip out. She makes one more turn in place [--] monocled gaze sliding across us without stopping [--] and then she strides away to the north."

The storage-exterior is in the Fish Market. The printed name is "tin building". Understand "tin" or "hut" or "building" or "rusting" or "corrugated" as storage-exterior. It fronts east. "Just east of here is a rusting corrugated tin building, which was built to house various possessions of the fishermen."
	The description is "It looks very much as though it would like to fall down, but it has not done so yet."
	
Sanity-check doing something in the presence of the Authenticator:
	if looking:
		make no decision;
	otherwise if going east:
		make no decision;
	otherwise if approaching the tin hut:
		make no decision;
	otherwise:
		if the authenticator is police:
			if waiting:
				make no decision;
			say "The movement catches her attention. She stares at us for a long moment. I have a moment's hope she's going to look away again, but something we're wearing or carrying tips her off. A moment later and she's signalled a backup officer to detain us.";
			end the story saying "The subsequent attention is not enjoyable";
		otherwise:
			now authenticator-warning is true;
			if going a direction:
				say "You assess the distance and work out that there's too much open space between us and cover if we head [noun]. The tin hut to the east is the only real option." instead;
			otherwise:
				say "This is too dangerous [--] [you][']ve got to get under cover before she sees us." instead.

Authenticator-warning is a truth state that varies.

Before reading a command when authenticator-warning is true:
	now authenticator is police.
		
Before going east in the presence of the Authenticator:
	say "While the Authenticator's back is turned, we slip inside..."

The concrete floor is scenery in the Fish Market. Some briny rivulets are part of the concrete floor. The description of the rivulets is "Run-off from the ice on which the fish were shown, this morning."


Check waving the letter-remover at the briny rivulets when the current setting of the letter-remover is "s":
	say "The letter-remover has a go, and for a moment the rivulets turn into a single, unified trickle. But the ground is so uneven that soon the liquid has diverged again into multiple rivulets. Some things can only be cleaned up the old-fashioned way, but fortunately this one isn't really our problem." instead


The Authenticator is a woman in Fish Market. Understand "tall" or "stern" or "woman" or "uniform" or "black" or "caped" as the Authenticator. "A tall, stern woman is standing in the middle of the market. She wears the black caped uniform of an Authenticator, and a monocle just like mine. And I don't think I want her to see us." The description of the Authenticator is "She isn't looking our way yet, but she will be any minute now."
 

Section 5 - Outdoor Cafe

The Outdoor Cafe is south of the Fish Market and west of Deep Street. The printed name is "Outdoor Café". "From this slightly raised terrace, tourists have a view of the activity in the market and out over the docks[one of][or]. The street is [east], the Fish Market [north][stopping]." 

The rocky cliff-face is a scenery facade in Outdoor Cafe. It fronts south. Understand "cliff" or "rocks" or "face" as the rocky cliff-face. The description is "This little terrace area has been carved out of the hillside. Immediately to the south there is only rough rock wall for many feet up."
	The closure notice is "That way is bare cliff rock. ".

The cafe building is a scenery facade in Outdoor Cafe. It fronts west. The printed name is "café building". Understand "café" as the cafe building. The description is "The source of drinks and small snacks when the café is in full operation. At the moment there isn't much sign of life from inside." The closure notice of the cafe building is "[if traffic circle is visited]The place is entirely closed now.[else]When we approach, a girl comes to the window and waves us off. 'We're just closing up. No new customers!'[end if]"

Some round black metal tables are supporters in the outdoor cafe. 
	"Several [round black metal tables] have been set out, with [umbrellas]." 
	The description is "The wobbly, tipsy kind of table that jog at a touch and spill your coffee everywhere.". 
	Understand "table" as the round black metal tables.
	
Nexami Engeo is an alert man. Understand "Nex" as Nexami Engeo. 
	The description is "A big man, both tall and stout. He hasn't reached overweight yet, but it looks like a matter of time. He's wearing [a list of things which are worn by Nexami]." 
	The introduction is "He's a musician, the front man of engeo. Your gang helped him out with some customs issues because of his unusual name."
	He wears a rocker jacket and jeans. 
	The description of the rocker jacket is "It's black leather. It might make the wearer look fierce if he didn't have such a round dimpled face." 
	The description of the jeans is "Blue. Ordinary cut. I'm not really an expert in fashion."
	
Rule for writing a paragraph about Nexami when Nexami is not as-yet-unknown:
	carry out the writing a topic sentence about activity with Nexami;
	carry out the giving surrounding details for activity with Nexami;
	now the rocker jacket is mentioned;
	now the jeans are mentioned;
	now held-break is true;
	say "[run paragraph on]";

Rule for writing a topic sentence about Nexami Engeo:
	say "[one of]Curiously, there's an acquaintance of yours here: [or][stopping][Nexami Engeo] is at one of the [round black tables]. [run paragraph on]"

The wire chair is a chair in the outdoor cafe. It is scenery. On the wire chair is Nexami.

A spill is on the round black tables. It is fluid scenery. The flexible appearance is "There's [a spill] [if the spill is in the location]on the ground[otherwise][in-on the holder of the spill][end if]." The description is "It looks like a quantity of red wine, just waiting to stain some vulnerable bit of clothing." 

Report Nexami saying hello to the player for the first time:
	now the spill is not scenery;
	say "Nexami nods to us. 'Watch out. That table next to you has something sticky spilled on it.' And indeed there is a spill. You were about to lean on it nonchalantly." instead.
	
Nexami-encounter is a scene. Nexami-encounter begins when Nexami is the current interlocutor. Nexami-encounter ends in abandonment when Nexami is not the current interlocutor. Nexami-encounter ends in departure when the time since Nexami-encounter began is two minutes.

When Nexami-encounter ends in departure:
	say "[if the prior named noun is Nexami]He[otherwise]Nexami[end if] stands up and mutters something. I have a little trouble with his Scottish accent [--] [you] don't get a lot of that around here, for obvious reasons [--] but you interpret it as him saying he'd better go pay up. 
	
He heads into the interior of the café.";
	reset the interlocutor;
	remove Nexami from play.

Instead of touching or rubbing the spill:
	say "Better not to get it on ourselves." 
	
Instead of taking the spill: 
	say "It's not the kind of thing [you] can just pick up and carry away."

Rule for disclosing contents of the round black metal tables when the round black metal tables support the spill:
	say "Someone has left [a spill] on [if Nexami is not visible]one of the tables[otherwise]another[end if][if the round black metal tables support a mentionable thing], nearly touching [the list of mentionable things on the round black metal tables][end if].[run paragraph on]".

[The introduction of Outdoor Cafe is "It is here that you and I first met: me drinking my coffee, you with an austere cup of herbal tea. I enjoyed that meeting, but somehow I am uncomfortable being here, as though [you] might be recognized as the couple from earlier. Ludicrous, I know. You're calm." ]

Rule for listing exits when looking in Outdoor Cafe: 
	do nothing instead.

Instead of touching the round black metal tables: say "The table wobbles under our fingers."

Some umbrellas are part of the round black metal tables. The description of the umbrellas is "They carry advertisements for brands of liqueur and beer." Understand "umbrella" as umbrellas. The umbrellas can be open or closed. The umbrellas are open. Instead of closing the umbrellas, say "They are meant as protection against the sunlight, and might [you] not draw notice from the waitstaff if [you] messed with them?" Instead of opening the umbrellas, say "They are already open."

Check waving the letter-remover at the umbrellas when the current setting of the letter-remover is "s":
	say "The waitstaff would certainly notice." instead

[Before going to the Tin Hut when the Counterfeit Monkey is unvisited:
	say "I'm sure that would be interesting under other circumstances, but we have an appointment to keep." instead. 
	
Before approaching the Tin Hut when the Counterfeit Monkey is unvisited:
	say "I'm sure that would be interesting under other circumstances, but we have an appointment to keep." instead. ]
	
Section 6 - Tin Hut

The Tin Hut is east of the Fish Market. It is indoors. "Most of the light in here comes from [circular windows] punched into the tin walls just under the ceiling. From the inside, the building looks both larger and more sound than it appears from outside: there are plenty of sturdy [struts] supporting the roof and keeping the walls upright."
	The introduction is "Sometimes smugglers and forgers have been known to stash things in here, since the building is close to the docks but rarely attracts the interest of customs officials."
	
Understand "hide [text]" as a mistake ("A natural impulse, but I don't think she's coming in here. And if she did, the last thing [you][']d want would be to be caught hiding. The key thing is to be in plain sight and obviously innocent.") when the location is the Tin Hut and the Authenticator is in the Fish Market.

Rule for listing exits while looking in the tin hut:
	do nothing instead.

Some tarpaulin-covered masses are an enterable supporter in Tin Hut. They are fixed in place. "Various [tarpaulin-covered masses] fill the room." The description is "From the shapes visible under the blue plastic, it appears that they are probably tables and stalls, buckets, signs, and other necessary features of the fish market when sales are in progress. There's a flattish area we could probably scramble onto." Understand "tarpaulin" or "tarp" or "tarps" or "tables" or "stalls" or "awnings" or "signs" or "buckets" or "table" or "stall" or "awning" or "bucket" or "flattish" or "area" as the masses.

The masses allow seated, standing, and reclining. The posture of the masses is standing.

Test massesbug with "x masses / stand on masses / climb on masses" in Tin Hut.
Test areabug with "jump onto flattish area / scramble onto flattish area / go to flattish area" in the Tin Hut.

Understand "jump onto/on/into/in [something]" as entering.
Understand "scramble onto/on/into/in [something]" as climbing.

Sanity-check approaching the masses:
	try entering the masses instead.

Sanity-check climbing the masses:
	try entering the masses instead.
	
Report entering the masses:
	say "[You] identify the sturdiest-looking part of the construction and clamber onto it." instead.

Instead of taking the masses:
	say "It all looks fairly heavy, but not useful. Also, and I real[ize] this weighs more with me than with you, I think the people who own it might mind the loss."

Instead of searching or looking under the masses:
	say "[one of]Lifting the edges of the nearest tarps confirms what [you] already suspected: they[or]They[stopping] are various tables, stalls, awnings, etc. belonging to the fish market."

Some circular windows are scenery in Tin Hut. "The windows admit diffuse light only." 
	Understand "sky" or "ellipse" or "window" or "ellipse of sky" as the circular windows.
	
Every turn when the Authenticator is in the Fish Market and the location is Tin Hut:
	if a random chance of 1 in 3 succeeds:
		say "[one of]Ominous sounds come through the windows, but we're at the wrong angle to see out[or]More racket comes in through the windows[stopping].".
	
Instead of entering or climbing the circular windows, say "Even if they were low enough to reach, each one has a hand's-breath diameter. At best [you] might be able to see through them."

The Authenticator has a number called patience. The patience of the Authenticator is 3.

Instead of searching the circular windows:
	if the player is on the masses:
		decrement the patience of the Authenticator;
		if the patience of the Authenticator is 0:
			remove the Authenticator from play;
		say "[You] put an eye to one of the windows. ";
		if the Authenticator is in Fish Market:
			say "[one of]The Authenticator is still in sight. Two assistants are in the middle of arresting a man for selling germ-based gems, but she is ignoring this play and looking for something or someone else[or]The Authenticator is still out there, looking for something[or]The Authenticator is crossing the market in this direction, but she's not looking straight at us, at least[stopping]." instead;
		otherwise:
			say "The coast looks clear. No one from the Customs House is doing a sweep at the moment." instead;
	say "At this angle, there is nothing to see but an ellipse of sky."

The struts are scenery in Tin Hut. Understand "strut" or "roof" or "wall" or "walls" or "tin" or "corrugated" as the struts. The description is "The struts form a dull but sturdy lattice of metal, supporting the corrugated metal roof and walls."

Instead of attacking the struts:
	say "When struck, the metal booms hollowly, but nothing happens."

The trap-door is a door. It is below the Tin Hut. "A [trap-door] is set in the floor[if something wedges the trap-door], propped by [a random thing which wedges the trap-door][end if]." The printed name is "trap door". Understand "trap" or "door" or "trapdoor" or "hinge" or "hinges" or "hinging" or "mechanism" as the trap-door. The description is "It is a wooden door set into the floor. The hinging mechanism is designed to keep the door closed if possible, perhaps as a safety feature so that people won't fall into an open hole."

Rule for writing a paragraph about the trap-door when the location is the Crawlspace:
	say "[The trap-door], wedged open by [a random thing which wedges the trap-door], admits the only light.";
	say line break.

Every turn when the trap-door is open and the trap-door is not wedged by something:
	now the trap-door is closed;
	say "The trap-door makes a creaking noise and slams shut again";
	if the player is in the Crawlspace:
		say ". I DO NOT LIKE being in the dark in a confined space with potential rats. Sorry, I'm getting us out of here. You can come back later.";
		wait for any key;
		try going up;
	otherwise if Crawlspace is not visited:
		say ". They must prop it open when they use it.";
	otherwise:
		say "."
		
Instead of going to the Crawlspace when the Crawlspace is visited and the trap-door is not wedged by something:
	say "Let's wait to explore down there until [you] can make sure the trap door won't slam on us."
	
Before closing a door which is wedged by something (called the impediment):
	say "(first removing [the impediment])[command clarification break]";
	try taking the impediment;
	if the noun is wedged by something:
		stop the action.
		
Before taking something which wedges the trap-door when the player is in the crawlspace:
	say "I'd rather not be confined down here in the dark, if it's all the same to you." instead.
	
Section 7 - The Crawlspace

The Crawlspace is below the trap-door. "An awkward, low, concrete-lined crawlspace beneath the tin hut. It smells somewhat like animals; in spite of this it clearly gets a bit more use than anyone would like the customs officials to know about."

The Crawlspace is indoors.

After deciding the scope of the player when the player is in the Crawlspace:
	if the trap-door is wedged by something (called the impediment):
		place the impediment in scope.
		
Report facing in Crawlspace:
	say "There is only darkness, but I assume the space extends only under the rest of the building. There's no obvious sign of any other interesting items being stored down here." instead.

The crate is a container in the Crawlspace. "[if the location is the Crawlspace]The only significant thing down here is a [crate][otherwise]A [crate] is here, looking desperately out of place[end if]." The crate is openable and closed and fixed in place. The heft of the crate is 4. 

Test crate-bug with "drop crate / put tub in crate / wave c-remover at crate / autoupgrade / wave c-remover at crate / open tub / gel rate / put plans in crate / wave c-remover at crate / n" holding the tub and the crate and the plans.

Report involuntarily-dropping the crate:
	say "[You] [are] forced to set the bulky crate down on the ground." instead.

Instead of taking the crate:
	say "[The crate] is too substantial to shift easily."
	
The watch is a wearable thing in the crate. The description of the watch is "An (apparently) valuable watch with diamonds set in the face."

The band is a thing in the crate. The description is "A paper strip used to keep printed materials together before distribution." 
	Understand "strip" or "paper strip" as the band.

The leaflet is an illegal thing in the crate. The description is "It's a subversive tract attacking the state's line on punishing people with inanimate status. It quotes the official state justification (from the days when they bothered to justify it at all) as follows:

[italic type]There are those who argue that it is just as inhumane to make a man inanimate as to kill him. And indeed it is a form of execution, in that the man is wiped out and some other thing replaces him. Execution, that is, in every detail but one: it is reversible. Many men have been executed in error, going innocent to the electric chair or the noose, and once dead they can never be retrieved. 

The personality of a man made inanimate, however, stays behind in the changed object, ready to be retrieved should new evidence come to light; and until that date he is harmless to society, and costs almost nothing to store (as compared to the costs of prison guardianship and maintenance).[roman type]
	
It follows up by discussing the problems with this argument: the tendency of objects to 'fade' over time so that their original form is completely lost; the fact that an inanimate object can hardly direct its own appeal proceedings; the strong words against this kind of punishment in the Geneva Conventions."

Rule for printing the name of the leaflet while listing contents of something:
	say "single discarded leaflet".
	
Section 8 - Docks

The Docks are north of the Fish Market. "Here are some dozens of [boats] tied up: some of them are small to medium-sized fishing craft, some tourist boats for trips around the island, some merely ferries to the deeper harbor where the cruise ships anchor."

The boats are scenery in the Docks. Understand "craft" or "fishing craft" or "tourist" or "ferries" as the boats. The description is "I know nothing about boats. You, on the other hand, appear to have an unnerving awareness of which of these craft are here on legal business and which are engaged in some form of smuggling or refugee-assistance."

[Why I had to call them boats as their primary name I don't know. It certainly requires a lot of specialized error-messaging...]

Check waving the letter-remover at the boats when the current setting of the letter-remover is "b":
	say "Turning all the harb[our] water to cold oatmeal would be an exploit to rival the Boston Tea Party, but the letter-remover is not powerful enough to accomplish it." instead.

Check waving the letter-remover at the boats when the current setting of the letter-remover is "o":
	say "It would be kind of amazing to turn the whole selection of boats into bats and watch them fly away. But there would be dozens of fatalities and massive amounts of property damage, so possibly it's just as well that the letter-remover is not powerful enough for the task." instead.

Check waving the letter-remover at the boats when the current setting of the letter-remover is "a":
	say "Creating an army of tiny robots out of the boats would be inspiring for a very brief period until they sank into the waves and short-circuited. The letter-remover isn't strong enough anyway." instead.

Check waving the letter-remover at the boats when the current setting of the letter-remover is "t":
	say "What a sight that would be: a whole cabaret-worth of feather boas floating on the waves. On the other hand, it would also be very dangerous to any people in the boats at the time. So probably just as well that the letter-remover lacks the power." instead.
	
Check waving the letter-remover at the boats when the current setting of the letter-remover is "s":
	say "Deplural[izing] all the boats would be a fascinating re-enactment of historical events, except that the boats are full of harmless tourists and the letter-remover doesn't have nearly the power required to achieve that goal."
 
The customs-exterior is a facade in Docks. It fronts east. "To the east, up a moderate rise from the sea-level docks, is the imposing exterior of the Customs House. The classical look is only a little undermined by the public-service posters along the front." The introduction is "There passports are inspected and cargo passed under authentication, foreign items renamed or confiscated, and suspected smugglers interrogated." 
	The description is "The building itself is not especially grand, but you have never been on the good side of the people who work there, and that gives you a perfectly justifiable dislike of the place, and the sense that it's larger than life."
	Understand "exterior" or "customs" or "house" as the customs-exterior. The printed name is "customs house".
	
Some public-service posters are part of the customs-exterior. The description is "The nearest one shows a kitten drawn in a sinuous Parisian style. 'BOUGHT YOUR PET ABROAD?' demands the poster. 'Consider linguistic realignment therapy!' 

Smaller type goes on to explain that even if you have had your dangerous [i]chat[/i] converted to a harmless cat at the border, there is a risk that without proper treatment it will have a litter of foreign-language offspring." Understand "poster" or "public" or "service" as the posters.
	
Rule for listing exits when looking in Docks:
	do nothing instead.
	


The counterfeit-monkey-exterior is a facade in the Docks. Understand "counterfeit" or "monkey" as the counterfeit-monkey-exterior. The printed name is "pub". It fronts west. "Immediately west, [if Counterfeit Monkey is unvisited and the garish sign is part of the counterfeit-monkey-exterior]a [garish sign] advertises a pub called the Counterfeit Monkey[otherwise if the garish sign is part of the counterfeit-monkey-exterior]the Counterfeit Monkey's [garish sign] sways in the wind[otherwise]the Counterfeit Monkey looks atypically bare with its sign missing[end if]." Understand "pub" or "bar" as the counterfeit-monkey-exterior. The description is "The place looks [--] and is [--] wholly disreputable."

The garish sign is part of counterfeit-monkey-exterior. It is a sign. The description is "In the picture, a villainous man threatens a cage full of tiny primates with a primitive Victorian letter-remover. In the background is an enormous bag of cash."
	The printed name of the garish sign is "sign".
	
Check waving the letter-remover at garish sign when the current setting of the letter-remover is "k":
	say "We try to K-remove the monkey on the sign, but at this distance and in this wind, it's a difficult bit of targeting, and we fail." instead. 
	
Check waving the letter-remover at the counterfeit-monkey-exterior when the current setting of the letter-remover is "k":
	say "Turning the entire pub into a heap of fake bills would be spectacular, but would not really advance our cause." instead.
	
Section 9 - Counterfeit Monkey

[The concept of the Monkey came fairly early.]

The Counterfeit Monkey is west of the Docks. It is proper-named and indoors. "[one of]It takes a minute for us to adjust to the light in here. [or]Infamously this pub was raided in 1929, the year that the Bureau developed its first meager attempt at an Authentication Scope, and dozens of smugglers and fraudulent businessmen went to jail. But neither that raid nor subsequent scrutiny has ever shut the place down entirely. [or][stopping]Built when people were a bit shorter and ceilings were a bit lower, the Counterfeit Monkey is always smoky and never well lit, even in the middle of the day." 

A description-concealing rule when Slango is in the Counterfeit Monkey:
	now the clientele is unmarked for listing;
	now the barman is unmarked for listing.
	
A description-concealing rule when the Counterfeit Monkey is not visited:
	now the clientele is unmarked for listing;
	now the barman is unmarked for listing;
	now the origin paste is unmarked for listing.

Rule for writing a topic sentence about the clientele:
	say "[The clientele] are currently engaged in a game of darts, while [the barman] watches and [if the player wears the britishizing goggles]practises[otherwise]practices[end if] a sarcastic wit on those who embarrass themselves[if the origin paste is on the bar-top]. There is also a quantity of [Origin Paste] sitting out on the bar[end if]. "; 
	

The dartboard is scenery in the Counterfeit Monkey. Understand "dart" or "darts" or "board" as the dartboard. The description is "Several guys are engaged in a lively game of darts. By their tattoos, you recogn[ize] them: they have a regular darts game in which smuggling drop-off coordinates are passed back and forth in the form of scores and the game's surrounding banter.

The result is that the Bureau has been trying to tape their communications for months without ever turning up evidence of wrongdoing."

Understand "playdarts" as a mistake ("We really don't want to attract the negative attention of those guys.").

Instead of doing something other than examining with the dartboard:
	say "We really don't want to attract the negative attention of those guys."

Check waving the letter-remover at the tattoos:
	say "Too hard to distinctly target the collective of tattoos when they're on various moving arms on various slightly drunk guys."

Some tattoos are part of the clientele. The description of the tattoos is "[one of]One says I HEART MA[or]One is a detailed rendering of scenes from Brooklyn[or]One looks like an Elder Sign[at random]."

The clientele is a person in Counterfeit Monkey. "[The clientele] is keeping [the barman] thoroughly busy."
	The description of the clientele is "A nasty-looking bunch. They can be good enough if you're on the right side of them, but getting and staying that way isn't easy. And they're justly suspicious: the customs house not infrequently tries to infiltrate the criminal organ[ization]s and brotherhoods, though with no great success." Understand "crowd" or "players" or "player" or "customers" or "customer" or "men" or "guys" or "people" or "man" or "guy" as the clientele.

The barman is a man in Counterfeit Monkey. The description of the barman is "His name is Parker, and he is a friend of yours, when you're wearing your own skin. At the moment, though, it seems like a good idea not to trust these friendships by making our new disguise known." Understand "bartender" or "barkeep" or "Parker" as the barman.

Instead of saying hello to the barman in the presence of Slango: 
	say "Better not; the less people notice this little conversation, the better."

Instead of saying hello to the clientele: 
	say "They're... busy. At best interrupting them would interrupt their code, and at worst it would make them think [you] [are] a Bureau agent."
	[say "At the moment they aren't harassing us, but there's no reason to get their attention. After all, it took plenty of work to get their respect the first time out, and we don't have the time now to earn it again."]

The bar-top is a supporter in Counterfeit Monkey. It is scenery. Understand "counter" or  "bar" as the bar-top. The printed name of the bar-top is "bar". The description is "Kept scrupulously clean, whatever you might say about the rest of the place."

To summon Slango:
	move Slango to the Counterfeit Monkey;
	now the barman is not alert.

Slango is an alert man. "[Slango] sits at [a dark table], nursing [a root beer]."
	The description is "He's dressed plainly but neatly: clean jeans, crisp white button-up shirt. His face is calm and his voice is even and he could be any age between thirty and fifty. He looked that way when you met him eight years ago, too."
	The introduction is "Slango is, of course, not Slango's real name. He is half criminal, half ideological revolutionary: uncouth, restless, always hungry for a new exploit. Had he been born into a freer society, he might have become a very valuable engineer or consultant. He has been your mentor in crime and your usher into the world of adults."
	
Slango wears clean jeans and a button-up shirt. The clean jeans and the button-up shirt are scenery. The description of the clean jeans is "He wears them as though they were uniform trousers." The description of the button-up shirt is "White and stainless."

Slango carries a root beer. 

Report Slango saying hello to the player:  
	complete "Meet your colleague Slango at Counterfeit Monkey";
	say "[one of]Slango meets our eye for a long minute without smiling[or]Slango nods to us[stopping]." instead.
	
Definition: a thing is slango-related:
	if it is enclosed by Slango:
		yes;
	no.

Instead of looking at a slango-related thing through an authentication scope:
	say "[The second noun] pings happily as [you] sight [the noun] with the crosshairs. [one of]Slango looks irritated.[or]'Would you mind putting that away?' Slango asks.[or]Slango sticks out his jaw.[stopping]".
	
The dark table is a supporter in the Counterfeit Monkey. The description is "[You] can't see it too well, which might be just as well." It is scenery.

The Marina is a region. The Counterfeit Monkey, Outdoor Cafe, the Fish Market, Deep Street, Tin Hut, Aquarium Bookstore, and the Docks are in the Marina.

Section 10 - Customs House

[The player is never going to leave via the Customs House. But for a portion of the story, it seems likely that he's going to need to -- so we keep the location here as a bit of misdirection, while trying to make it clear that there's nothing *yet* available to do in this location. (Otherwise, the fact that nothing is implemented as a way to leave the island would be a clear signal about the twist endings to come.)

The people entering and leaving are light local color, but they're not meant to be interesting enough to hold the player's attention long, as he does have other things he is supposed to be doing. 

At least, that's the theory. In practice, there's massively more complex output than there needs to be, mostly because making this stuff up is fun.

In an earlier version of the game, the player *did* leave via the Customs House, after first solving a puzzle of manipulating the exit lines — the challenge was to distract multiple officers by creating fake humans and animals, so that everyone manning customs was kept busy dealing with these frauds while the player snuck into a back room to rescue Brock. But this puzzle proved fiddly to explain to the player and not actually very much fun, so we axed the entire sequence. At that point the game was also perhaps a half or two thirds its present length: not only was it missing the escapades in the Bureau basement, but it also lacked the traffic circle and the dead drop/map store sequence. ]

The Customs House is east of the Docks. It is indoors. "This one building handles both people entering Atlantis by sea and those leaving, so there is an entry line (which feeds out into the city by the door we used) and an exit line (which snakes through from here to the point where boats and ferries board their passengers). 

There is a [long line] of people waiting to leave Atlantis, even on Serial Comma Day."
	The introduction is "No one is paying any attention to us [i]yet[/i], but I wouldn't advise spending much time here."
	
Sanity-check entering the long line:
	say "We can only afford to try going through this line once, and it's going to have to be when we're really ready to leave. Which we're not." instead.
	
The assorted side rooms are scenery in the Customs House. Understand "private" or "room" as the assorted side rooms. The description is "The side rooms provide auxiliary services: quarantine for linguistically unsuitable objects, kennels for animals that will need to undergo alignment therapy, holding cells for suspects."

The long line is a scenery enterable container in the Customs House. The description is "The line is made up mostly of businessmen and scientists and the occasional professor with academic leave to go elsewhere, as well as departing tourists." Understand "entry" or "exit" or "professor" or "academic" or "academics" or "tourist" or "tourists" or "vacationer" or "vacationers" or "businessman" or "businesswoman" or "businesspeople" or "businessmen" or "businessperson" or "businesswomen" or "scientist" or "scientists" or "man" or "men" or "woman" or "women" as the long line.

Some local-officials are scenery in the Customs House. Understand "officials" or "official" or "customs" as the local-officials. The printed name is "customs officials". The description is "The officials are at the far end of a very long line."


An Atlantida propaganda poster is fixed in place in Customs House. Understand "old" or "war-time" or "wartime" or "war" or "war time" as the propaganda poster. The printed name is "old war-time poster". "An [Atlantida propaganda poster] on the wall shows Atlantida striding boldly forward." The description is "The poster is huge, almost as tall as [you] are, and covers most of a wall. Atlantida, dressed in blue, walks towards the viewer from a bold sunrise background. The legend reads THE SPIRIT OF OUR PEOPLE.

It was part of a propaganda campaign to get the Atlanteans to think of Atlantis as inherently invulnerable, on the off-chance that the belief would create the reality. 

And we never were invaded, for whatever that's worth, though the Axis would certainly have found the island a useful base.".

[I wanted to reinforce the idea of Atlantida several times in the mid to late game as establishing shots for the endgame. The idea of the propaganda poster specifically comes from the gazillion KEEP CALM AND CARRY ON posters one sees everywhere in the UK right now: a nod to the phlegmatic courage of the past.]

The uninteresting posters are a scenery thing in the Customs House. The description is "The nearest one depicts a man having his foreign-language dictionaries confiscated."

[This is a bit of game archaeology: very early on, when the terms of the Atlantidan world weren't very well established, I'd written the "Confiscated Articles Room" as a bit of fantasia. Later it became obvious that I couldn't seriously make a full game in which articles mattered at all. So I commented it out, but didn't ever actually erase it from the code.

The description of the Confiscated Articles Depository is "A room brightly but unsympathetically lit, whose walls are lined with shelves; and on the shelves are dozens and dozens of confiscated articles, both definite and indefinite."

Some shelves are scenery in the Depository. The description of the shelves is "Ordinary metal shelves, painted beige."

The dead articles are on the shelves. Understand "confiscated" and "definite" and "indefinite" as the articles. The articles are scenery. "Plucked from their nouns, they are limp and pale. The ones in front are a typical mix of 'le' and 'il' and 'gli', 'der' and 'die' and 'la' and 'des'. Towards the back they get more interesting, though little more than husks now [--] I'm sure I see a 'τῶν' wedged back there, and in a contraband alphabet at that." Instead of doing something other than examining with the articles: say "There is bound to be an alarm." ]


Part 2 - Direct Disobedience

Section 1 - Traffic Circle

["The population has often been atomized (turned into a mass of isolated individuals) unable to work together to achieve freedom, to confide in each other, or even do much of anything at their own initiative." -- From Dictatorship to Democracy, Gene Sharp.]

[This scene wraps up Act 2, which has been about themes of concealment and performance, forcing the player to act on a large stage.

Designwise, it attempts to

-- reinforce the teaching about how to use the origin paste, which the player will need again to create the pass
-- establish the restoration-gel rifle and ways of using it well in advance of the endgame; at least hint at the idea of shooting an opponent's gun as well as the opponent himself
-- provide a small, focused set scene as a pacing contrast to the more sprawling, broad passages that come before and (especially) after

Expositionally, it has to

-- establish the symbolism of Atlantida, the propaganda war by which both sides try to lay claim to her, and the special significance of the squid
-- show Alex beginning to move away from his cowardice and embrace the abilities that Andra gives him (though in this case that can be a serious misjudgment)
-- drive home ideas about localized linguistic effectiveness mentioned briefly in the Lena scene

Dramatically, it tries to

-- bookend Act 2, counterbalance the hiding scene with the Authenticator that begins the act, and thus point out the change in Alexandra's courage and attitude.
-- create the first complicity questions about Andra's relationship to Alex: does she want to do the same things he does? Alex's appetite for violence in this scene is stronger than Andra's, though in other places he claims to be a nonviolent person; this is the expression of the rage of an oppressed person finally coming to the top
-- establish that the Bureau is a genuine and serious threat, as this is the first time we see them do something seriously awful

Check waving the letter-remover at the Traffic Circle when the current setting of the letter-remover is "l":

Traffic Circle is inside from the Roundabout. It is a privately-controlled outdoors road. 

Procedural rule while dropping the restoration-gel rifle when the location is Traffic Circle:
	ignore the no-dropping rule.
	
Rule for describing the interior of the car when the location is Traffic Circle:
	say "Normally no pedestrian ever comes to this circle of grass and litter: the flow of traffic is too constant and too fast.

	"A [giant Atlantida statue] stands at the cen[ter][if something unsuitable is on the giant Atlantida statue], decorated in an unorthodox fashion with [a list of unsuitable things on the giant Atlantida statue][end if][if the signet is on the giant Atlantida statue]. [A signet], outsized, representing the seal of the Bureau, hangs around her neck in classic albatross fashion[end if][if the restoration-gel rifle is in the location]. [The restoration-gel rifle] is propped against the base of the statue[end if]."
	The introduction is "Atlantida is to us a bit as Uncle Sam might be to you, except that she embodies the spirit of the people rather than the government. In recent years she's become a symbol of opposition to the Bureau."
	
The huge-metal-arm is part of the giant Atlantida statue. It is a distant fixed in place enterable supporter. The printed name is "huge metal arm". Understand "huge" or "enormous" or "metal" or "arm" as the huge-metal-arm. The description of the huge-metal-arm is "It is bare and muscular, as though Atlantida is envisioned championing her people through a series of arm-wrestling matches."

Rule for writing a topic sentence about someone (called the target) who is on the huge-metal-arm:
	say "[The target] has climbed partway out along Atlantida's [huge-metal-arm]."
	
The olive branch is on the huge-metal-arm. The description is "A metal olive branch, complete with metal leaves and metal olives." Understand "leaves" or "metal" or "olives" as the olive branch.

A description-concealing rule when the location is Traffic Circle:
	now the olive branch is not marked for listing;
	now every car is not marked for listing;

To decide what object is home for (item - the olive branch):
	decide on huge-metal-arm.

To decide what object is home for (item - the live branch):
	decide on huge-metal-arm.

After waving the letter-remover at the olive branch creating the live branch:
	now the live branch is part of the huge-metal-arm;
	say "[one of]It takes a little more care with aim than usual, but we do manage to strike the olive branch, turning it into a live branch. It goes green and healthy at once[or]Confidently we reconvert the olive branch[stopping]. 
	
[irritation reaction]."; 
	
Irritation count is a number that varies.

Last irritation is a time that varies.

To say irritation reaction:
	if the irritation count is:
		-- 0: say "The All-Purpose Officer glances around, but [if the player encloses the rifle]you've made us stand so our body conceals the rifle from his angle[otherwise]he doesn't notice us[end if]. He growls in annoyance. 'Station,' he says, apparently to thin air. 'I need back-up.'[paragraph break][i]Understood[/i], says a tinny distant voice";
		-- 1: say "'The power of the people!' shouts one of the protesters approvingly.[paragraph break]'Station,' comments the All-Purpose Officer. 'Aborting work on the statue until back-up arrives. Situation here is volatile.'[paragraph break][i]NEGATIVE[/i], replies his tinny interlocutor. [i]Statue to remain clear as first priority. This is from Oracle[/i]";
		-- 2: say "The protesters are cheering and stamping their feet. People in the cars are honking. The All-Purpose Officer tries to crane his head around and see who exactly is making all the trouble, but he quickly realizes he can't do that and hold on at the same time";
		-- 3: say "'[i]Guillemets[/i],' swears the All-Purpose Officer, daringly.[paragraph break][i]Did not copy, say again?[/i] asks the tinny invisible radio.[paragraph break]'Did Oracle happen to say why the statue was top priority?' asks the Officer.[paragraph break][i]That's a negative,[/i] responds the radio";
		-- 4: say "'Station,' growls the All-Purpose Officer into thin air. 'I am underpowered and back-up is not arriving. We need three vans and a DP tank.' His face is shiny with sweat";
		-- 5: say "[i]DP tank? Confirm request![/i] insists the tinny radio.[paragraph break]'That's what I said,' the All-Purpose Officer responds.[paragraph break][i]I'll have to clear this with Herself,[/i] the radio complains";
		-- 6: say "Tormented, the All-Purpose Officer seems beyond speech, while the crowd has lost interest in the symbolic potency of the statue and is starting to lapse back into irritability. You overhear someone asking where to find soft-serve ice cream. From far off there is a rumbling of heavy vehicles approaching";
	if irritation count is greater than 1 and the teenagers are not in the location:
		say "[one of].[paragraph break]This is fun. I'm actually doing something, for once[or].[paragraph break]Poor bastard. You've got good aim. Like one of those western sheriffs who can shoot the gun out of his enemy's hand[or][stopping]";
	increase the irritation count by 1;
	now last irritation is the time of day.
	
	
The protest-sign is on the giant Atlantida statue. The printed name is "sign". Understand "sign" as the protest-sign. 

The description of the protest-sign is "It reads:

The Spirit of Atlantis is the Spirit of Referendum!

NO MORE 'NON-REFERRABLE PROCEDURES'...[line break]
...ON INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS[line break]
...ON ECONOMIC POLICY[line break]
...ON HUMAN RIGHTS".

The stuffed octopus is a thing. It is on the giant Atlantida statue. The flexible appearance of the stuffed octopus is "The discarded stuffed octopus lies on the ground[one of], looking sadly at us[or], googly eyes fixed on the heavens[at random]."

The description of the stuffed octopus is "Slightly wrong, actually, but I suppose they didn't have a stuffed squid handy. Of the four symbols associated with Atlantis, the squid [--] representing invention and individuality [--] is the one that has greatest resonance for protesters[if the stuffed octopus in on the giant Atlantida statue].

This one has been tied to Atlantida's hand alongside the olive branch she traditionally carries[end if]."
 

Some traffic-island-protesters are a plural-named man. The printed name is "protesters".  Understand "protesters" or "crowd" as the traffic-island-protesters. "Protesters clog the street and sit or stand around the base of the statue."

The All-Purpose-Officer is a privately-named man in Traffic Circle. The printed name is "All-Purpose Officer". Understand "all" or "purpose" or "all-purpose" or "officer" as the All-Purpose-Officer. The description is "He is uniformed and has a look of serious determination." The All-Purpose-Officer is carrying a diminutive affixer and a restoration-gel rifle.

The description of the diminutive affixer is "A piece of special[ize]d equipment resembling a copper-plated staple gun. It shoots 'ette's and 'ling's and the odd 'mini' into words capable of receiving such endings." 

Report taking the restoration-gel rifle for the first time:
	say "[You] pick up the rifle. It fits well in your hand: good heft. I feel like we know how to aim this thing. It's illegal to carry, but that doesn't seem to be bothering you right now." instead.
[The film crew is a man in Traffic Circle. "In addition to everything else, there's a small film crew [--] cameraman, someone with a mike, and what appears to be a reporter or narrator [--] filming the whole thing. The Bureau must love this."
	The description of the film crew is "It's curious how a familiar place in a TV show makes the show seem more authentic, but a film crew on location makes the [i]location[/i] seem fake. The protesters are giving the film crew an unreasonable amount of space, more than they'd allow to anyone else."]
	

Check waving the letter-remover at the teenagers when the current setting of the letter-remover is "s":
	say "Reducing the pair of teenagers to a single teenager would just add our own war crimes to this mix." instead.
	
Some teenagers are a woman in Traffic Circle. Understand "teens" or "teenage" or "girls" or "girl" or "teenager" or "defiant" or "nervous" or "handcuffs" or "cuff" or "cuff" or "handcuff" as the teenagers. "Two [teenagers] are cuffed to [a tree], apparently for safe-keeping while [the All-Purpose-Officer] undoes their vandalism." The description of the teenagers is "One of them looks nervous, the other defiant[one of]. When she catches us looking her way, she contorts herself uncomfortably in order to be able to give us the finger[or][stopping]."

Instead of saying hello to the teenagers:
	say "We try shouting to them over the hubbub of the crowd, but it doesn't really work. [one of]The defiant one waggles her tongue at us obscenely.[or]The nervous one swallows pathetically.[at random]".
	
Instead of saying hello to the All-Purpose-Officer:
	say "Aside from the fact that he's thoroughly distracted at the moment, I don't think we really [i]want[/i] his attention. He'll lock us up if he pays any attention at all to who and what we are."

A brown tree is a fixed in place thing in Traffic Circle. Understand "leaves" or "leaf" as the brown tree. The description is "It's a tree of indeterminate species. I'm pretty sure it wasn't here yesterday. Though the leaves are dusty and brown, there's no leaf-fall at all underneath the tree, and it's not one of the palms that usually grow in this area."

Instead of putting the restoration gel on the tree:
	say "There's too much intervening crowd for us to get there with any speed."

When play begins:
	now the brown tree is not proffered by the brown tree;
	now the brown tee proffers the tree.

Every turn when the brown tree is not in Traffic Circle and the teenagers are in Traffic Circle:
	remove the teenagers from play;
	say "Freed from attachment to the tree, the teenagers look at each other and then run off into the crowd[if the stuffed octopus is in the location]. After a moment, the defiant one comes back, picks up the stuffed octopus, and re-enters the fray[end if].";
	if the stuffed octopus is in the location:
		remove the stuffed octopus from play;
	say "[line break][irritation reaction].";
	[record "rescuing a couple of teenagers" as achieved; ]
	
Sanity-check doing something when the noun is the tee or the second noun is the tee:
	move the tee to the repository;
	say "...come to mention it, where [i]is[/i] that tee? It must be somewhere in the grass, but we can't see it any more. Oh well. It's not as though I was planning an urgent golf game this afternoon." instead.

Instead of climbing the giant Atlantida statue:
	say "It doesn't look safe, and it would only make us more conspicuous."
	
 
Instead of going out from Traffic Circle during protest-scenario:
	say "The way is still blocked by protesters."

Protest-scenario is a scene. Protest-scenario begins when the location is Traffic Circle and the player is not in a car.

Definition: a thing is unsuitable:
	if it is the live branch:
		yes;
	if it is the stuffed octopus:
		yes;
	if it is the protest-sign:
		yes;
	no.
	
A distant stuff rule when the person asked is the All-Purpose-Officer:
	rule succeeds.

Every turn when the player is in Traffic Circle:
	if the teenagers are in the location:
		say "[one of]'Go ahead, put us in Cold Storage!' shouts the defiant teenager. 'I'm happy to sleep through all this shit and wake up when we have jet packs and a government that respects the rights of its people.'[or]The nervous teenager looks unhappy. 'We won't get out of here until our families are all dead and global warming has reduced Atlantis to three square feet of hilltop.'[or]The nervous teenager struggles against her bonds.[or]One of the other protesters tries to free the teenagers while the All-Purpose Officer isn't paying attention, but the bonds are too strong.[or]The teenagers look at us rather desperately.[stopping]";
	if All-Purpose-Officer can see an unsuitable thing (called the target) which is enclosed by the giant Atlantida statue:

			make no decision;
		if the All-Purpose-Officer is on the giant Atlantida statue:
			try the All-purpose-officer exiting;

			make no decision;
		if the player encloses the restoration-gel rifle:
			say "The All-Purpose Officer, no longer distracted by the pressing business of tidying up the Atlantida statue, notices us with the rifle. 

He has no qualms about hitting us with the diminutive affixer. It turns out that Alexandrette is a goldilocked poppet with a minimal capacity for self-def[ense] and no gun skills whatever. We're ignominiously [i]carried[/i] back to the Bureau and our subsequent trials are humiliation in a frilly pink dress.";
			end the story saying "That was careless";
	 
	
Before the All-Purpose-Officer entering the giant Atlantida statue when the All-Purpose-Officer carries something (called target) which is not the diminutive affixer:
	try the All-Purpose-Officer dropping the target instead.
	 
	
Before the All-Purpose-Officer touching an unsuitable thing which is on the giant Atlantida statue when the All-Purpose-Officer carries the stuffed octopus:
	try the All-Purpose-Officer dropping the stuffed octopus instead.

Instead of the All-Purpose-Officer dropping the stuffed octopus:
	move the stuffed octopus to the Traffic Circle;
	say "The All-Purpose Officer tosses the stuffed octopus away. It falls pathetically to earth."; 
	rule succeeds. 
	
Instead of the All-Purpose-Officer touching the stuffed octopus:

Report the All-purpose-officer dropping the restoration-gel rifle:
	say "[The actor] shift[s] the [noun] from one hand to another; looks around; and then props it against the foot of the statue." instead.

Report dropping the restoration-gel rifle in the presence of the giant Atlantida statue:
	say "[You] prop the rifle back at the foot of the statue." instead.

Report the All-purpose-officer entering the giant Atlantida statue:
	say "[one of][The actor] goes around to the back of the statue and begins to climb up the leg, finding footholds in the folds of Atlantida's gown. It looks like a precarious business, but he's determined[or][irritation reaction].[paragraph break][The actor] begins to climb Atlantida once more[stopping]." instead.
	
Report the All-purpose-officer entering the huge-metal-arm:
	say "[one of]Gritting his teeth, [the actor] climbs for access out onto Atlantida's [huge-metal-arm]. It looks about as sturdy as a substantial tree branch, but more slippery, and inconveniently angled[or][irritation reaction]. [The actor] clambers back onto the arm[stopping]." instead.
	
Report the All-purpose-officer exiting when the All-purpose-officer is on the giant Atlantida statue:
	say "[The all-purpose-officer] climbs back onto Atlantida's torso[if the player carries the restoration-gel rifle]. We'd better not let him catch us with this rifle[end if]." instead.

Instead of the All-Purpose-Officer touching the live branch:
	say "The All-Purpose Officer reaches out and touches [the noun][one of]. He must have a small restoration gel applicator[or] with his gel-covered finger[stopping]. ";
	gel-convert the live branch.
	
Instead of the All-Purpose-Officer touching the protest-sign:
	say "[one of]Once the All-Purpose Officer comes level with [the protest-sign], he shoots it with [the diminutive affixer], turning it into a signet[or]Forced to repeat himself, [the actor] jams the diminutive affixer into the sign a little harder than strictly necessary, with predictable results[or]Stony-faced with fury, [the actor] punches [the protest-sign] again with the diminutive affixer[stopping]. [run paragraph on][signet description][paragraph break]";
	diminish the protest-sign.

To diminish (item - a thing):
	move the signet to the holder of the item;
	move the item to the repository;
	now the signet is not proffered by anything;
	now the item proffers the signet.

Carry out shooting the signet with the restoration-gel rifle:
	increase the iteration of the signet by 1.

Report shooting the signet with the restoration-gel rifle:
	say "[irritation reaction].";
	
[Somewhat cheaply, to explain why we can't just gel the depluralized pedestrians and why we don't want to keep the rifle anyway, we have the player run out of pellets just before the scene concludes. But it fits, anyhow: gives the idea of a limited and rare resource in contrast with the other items that we'll be using more constantly.]
	
Instead of shooting something with the restoration-gel rifle when the irritation count is 6 and protest-scenario is happening:
	say "We take a shot, but the rifle is out of gel pellets. It clicks uselessly in our hands.

Sanity-check taking the restoration-gel rifle when the All-Purpose-Officer is not enclosed by the giant Atlantida statue and protest-scenario is happening:

Instead of shooting the All-purpose-officer with the restoration-gel rifle:

The back of his shirt is covered with gel.[paragraph break][irritation reaction][or][You] shoot again. He'll have some bruises tonight.[paragraph break][irritation reaction][stopping]."

[As "shooting something that the enemy is holding" sets up a parallel with the solution to the Atlantida endgame puzzles, we want to reward the line of thinking rather than discouraging it.

In re. the leaflet, this happens only if the player hasn't already found the leaflet in the crate (where it functions as a possible preparation for this scene). In general, we don't play many magician's choice tricks in Counterfeit Monkey, but it's worth cheating a little occasionally to make sure that the player not only finds what we want him to find but does so in an order that fits the pace and flavor of what's going on around him in the game. Running across this leaflet *after* the protest is still conceivably possible if the player doesn't find the crate earlier *and* doesn't shoot the affixer, but it's less likely.]

Instead of shooting the diminutive affixer with the restoration-gel rifle when the All-purpose-officer is enclosed by the giant Atlantida statue:

The Officer realizes that something unthinkable has just happened, and gels the statuette at once. The status quo is thus restored, more or less, except that the Officer is now clinging precariously to the statue's leg.

Instead of shooting the giant Atlantida statue with the restoration-gel rifle:

Book 3 - Act III Among Scholars

Part 1 - The James Bond Part of Town

Chapter 1 - Long Street

Section 1 - LS North

South of Roundabout is Long Street North. 

Literal Restaurant is a facade in Long Street North. It fronts east. It is scenery. The description is "A framed menu announces the specials for tonight: Lamb with a Deplural[ize]d Apricot Reduction, Armagnac-Drunken Capon, and Lobster Tail Nestled in Bubbles of Flav[our]-Abstract."

Instead of looking toward Roundabout:
	say "That direction is just a chaos of traffic and bad signage."

Long Street North is a proper-named and southern road. "Long Street is lined on each side with a double-row of tall, an[ae]mic palm trees that bend towards one another many feet overhead. This corridor continues some considerable distance south."

Some anemic palm trees are a backdrop. They are in Long Street North and Long Street South. The description is "The only foliage comes in a clump high above. The effect is distorted and unnatural, and I say that having lived with them all my life. They are trees in the same sense that ostriches are birds." The printed name is "an[ae]mic palm trees". Understand "palms" or "anaemic" as the anemic palm trees. 

South of Long Street North is Long Street South. Long Street South is a proper-named southern road. "Long Street is lined on each side with a double-row of tall, an[ae]mic palm trees that bend towards one another many feet overhead. [You] are now in the southern part of this long corridor, between the Canadian Embassy and Arbot Maps & Antiques."

The Canadian Embassy is a facade in Long Street South. It fronts east. It is scenery. The description is "The embassy is the largest foreign embassy here: Canadians do a lot of business with Atlantis, but the Québécois require special permission to enter, so there's a call for substantial clerical work. The building is a solid 1960s block in concrete with slit-shaped windows." Understand "concrete" or "windows" or "solid" or "block" or "slit-shaped" or "slit" or "window" or "slit shaped" or "slits" as the Canadian Embassy.

The shopping bag is a container in Long Street South. "Someone has left a shopping bag at the roadside [--] maybe by accident when loading up a car, maybe because they mean to come back for it." The description is "The logo on the outside is from Landison's, a popular toy store on the island. It's probably closed today, so this would have been bought earlier [--] possibly even as a present for Serial Comma Day."

Check waving the letter-remover at the shopping bag when the current setting of the letter-remover is "s":
	say "The device buzzes, puzzled. Evidently there is not enough Atlantean interest in brewing to make 'hopping bag' a recogn[ize]d item in itself." instead.

A ball is a thing in the shopping bag. The description is "Made of blue and white rubber, and decorated all over with a pattern of random letters in different sportive fonts."

The jigsaw-puzzle is a privately-named thing in the shopping bag. The printed name is "jigsaw". Understand "jigsaw" or "puzzle" as the jigsaw-puzzle. The description is "The boxed puzzle displays an execution scene, with several pro-British traitors from the 1820s being lined up before the deplural[ization] cannon. It was thought a considerable punishment to be forced to share a body and consciousness with others."

Instead of opening the jigsaw-puzzle:
	say "The box is sealed shut for now, which is just as well. Opening it would destroy its jigsaw integrity."
	
Understand "solve [jigsaw-puzzle]" as a mistake ("Better to leave it in its box, I think.").

Section 2 - The Antiques Dealership

After going to Arbot Maps & Antiques:
	if Arbot Maps & Antiques is visited:
		make no decision;
	if the player carries the appointment card:
		say "We show the appointment card, and are let in.";
		now Kate carries the appointment card;
	otherwise:
		say "The woman watching over the store stops you. 'I'm sorry,' she says. 'We are only open to those who have made previous visiting arrangements.' And we're shooed back out.";
		move the player to Long Street South, without printing a room description.

Arbot Maps & Antiques is west of Long Street South. It is indoors and southern. Understand "shop" or "store" or "antique" as Arbot Maps &  Antiques.

Instead of smelling Arbot Antiques:
	say "The place smells of fresh coffee and old paper."

The maps collection is a thing in Arbot Maps & Antiques. Understand "large" or "collection" or "of" or "antique" or "under glass" or "street maps" or "maiana" or "navigation" or "distant places" or "charts" or "island" or  "topography" as the maps collection.

I got it out because it provides a general overview of adjectival 'adherence' [--] that is, how and when an adjective is so much part of the name of something that it can be affected by tools like your [letter-remover], and when it is purely incidental. 

I see I may be losing you. Shall I put this in layman's terms? >>";
	if the player consents
	begin;
		say "[line break]The short version is: I want to design a language with spelling and pronunciation selected so that valuable resources like food, water, and clothing can easily be made from available resources and pollutants such as plastic garbage and seawater. 

There are major problems in constructing such a language because ideas like 'pure' and 'potable' and 'healthy' tend to be specified by adjectives rather than by nouns [--] English doesn't have one colloquial word that means 'pure water', for instance. But I believe that a correctly constructed language that incorporated the concept of 'pure water' into a single word would be exceptionally powerful and might transform the third world.";
	otherwise;
		say "[line break]Okay, then. 

In general, strongly-adhering adjectives produce problems by preventing conversions that might otherwise be possible; conversely, it is difficult to make objects with particular characteristics because those characteristics are described by weakly-adhering adjectives.

The point is: it is possible to use linguistic tools to create water. It is [i]not[/i] reliably possible, at least in American English, to use those tools to create potable water, because 'potable' is a weakly-adhering adjective describing a statistically uncommon trait. This means that linguistic reification is helpless to solve water supply problems, even in third-world regions using a high-efficacy language. For that matter even when a word has a strongly-adhering adjective, the interference of that adjective usually just makes the object impossible to reify at all.

What [you] need, therefore, is a language with nouns that uniquely specify substances['] desirable traits: 'potable' or 'pure' water should be named something distinct from adulterated forms of H2O, and so on. 

Have I bored you enough yet? >>";
		if the player consents, say "[line break]Right, sorry. Well, you get the general idea, anyway.";
		otherwise say "[line break]Scientific jargon does, of course, exist to specify objects uniquely, but there are two problems. One is that most chemical and biological terminology is used by such a small subset of the population that it has near-zero linguistic efficacy: creating a substance by formula requires an amount of energy roughly on par with pointing a w-remover at Aberystwyth. This is not a realistic solution to resource problems. 

The second difficulty is that even with well-known exceptions such as 'H2O', the formula is not usually not a linguistic subset of the formula of another widely available and well-known substance.

Hence the need for a new language with nouns designed based on careful scientific research into the primary needs and resources of living in a given region. This language could then be systematically taught to everyone dwelling in that area, causing permanent economic uplift. 

'Systematically taught' is a bit of a problem, since it would take massive funding and effort to make the language known widely enough to gain linguistic efficacy. And there would be significant issues in not totally crowding out indigenous languages and thus destroying an existing culture.

But I have high hopes, assuming I can ever get out of this repressive little burg and make my case to one or more of the major world relief organ[ization]s.";

Chapter 3 - Campus Itself

Section 1 - University Oval

The sturdy iron gate is southeast of Palm Square. It is scenery. The sturdy iron gate is a door. The sturdy iron gate is closed, lockable, and locked. The description of the sturdy iron gate is "The campus as a whole is walled and gated because of the amount of linguistic research that happens inside. This is a very lightweight form of security, more symbolic than anything, with much more significant protections on the really powerful materials[if the ring is not handled].

I have the student ring that opens this back in my apartment. I just wasn't expecting to need to go in there ever again[ring-fetch][end if].".

After printing the name of the sturdy iron gate when Palm Square is not visited:
	say " to the university".

To say ring-fetch:
	assign "Retrieve my student ring from my apartment" at Apartment Bathroom.

The ring unlocks the sturdy iron gate. The ring unbolts the sturdy iron gate. 

Carry out taking the ring:

The description is "They're handsome old trees [--] the same white-trunked hybrids that line the avenues of Provence, I'm told, growing several [if the player wears the Britishizing goggles]storeys[otherwise]stories[end if] tall and creating a tolerable shade even on very hot days." Understand "sycamores" as the sycamore trees.

Instead of climbing the sycamore trees:
	say "They're too tall. Even the lowest branches are inconveniently high."
	
buildings-general is scenery in University Oval. The description is "Of the original 1757 foundation of the University, little now remains, and the oldest building on campus is the administration building, a Georgian creation of white steps and columns, ca. 1780. That's further east, though, and the buildings here around the Oval are mostly from the enormous expansion of the university in 1911-1940, when the publication of the New Orthodox Orthography caused a rapid expansion in language-related disciplines.

My own building is Samuel Johnson Hall, to the south."

s-johnson-hall-exterior is a facade in University Oval. The printed name is "Samuel Johnson Hall". It fronts south. "Immediately south of here is the building where I spend most of my time, Samuel Johnson Hall.".
	Understand "building" or "samuel" or "johnson" or "hall" as s-johnson-hall-exterior.
	The description is "When it was built in the [']30s, the whole purpose was to prove to the rest of the faculty the tremendous value of the new field of language studies (as opposed to language engineering, a field long valued for its ability to produce tools and, more importantly, weapons). 

Consequently, [s-johnson-hall-exterior] was built to impress: a blind windowless front of white stone rising grandly from the pavement; an oppressive [portico] that makes entering figures look tiny."
	
The portico is part of s-johnson-hall-exterior. 
	Understand "blind" or "windowless" or "front" or "white stone" or "stone" or "oppressive" or "statues" or "relief" or "statue" or "letter e" or "letter t" or "letters" or "e" or "t" or "shining" or "bronze" as the portico.
	The description is "The portico is many times taller than a person, and is flanked by relief sculptures of two massive, fleshly, ideal[ize]d figures, reminiscent of early Soviet art. One holds a large letter E, the other a letter T: the two most common letters in the English language. 

The letters are not carved from the same stone, but are attachments made of shining bronze.".

The business-school-exterior is a facade in University Oval. It fronts north. It is scenery. The printed name is "business school". Understand "brick" or "building" or "business school" as the business-school-exterior.

The east-campus-extension is a facade in University Oval. It fronts east. It is scenery. The printed name is "Sycamore Walk". Understand "sycamore" or "walk" as the east-campus-extension. The description is "Sycamore Walk runs east towards the older part of campus. But [you] have no useful business there today [--] I wouldn't be able to get us into the buildings, and I don't think it would help anyway."

Instead of going east in University Oval:
	try examining east-campus-extension.

An activist is an alert woman in University Oval. Understand "student" or "protester" as the activist. "[An activist] is standing in our way[if the activist carries the bright yellow sign], gripping [a bright yellow sign] that says 'TOXI WASTE AWARENESS!'[end if]."

[Every turn when the activist can see the player and the activist is not the current interlocutor:
	try the activist saying hello to the player.]
	
Report the activist saying hello to the player:
	queue environment-offer instead.

Instead of giving bills to the activist:
	say "Your mind rebels at the thought. You need this money [--] we both do. Without it, we haven't a hope of making our way in another country."
 

Instead of going south from University Oval in the presence of the activist:

	otherwise:
		say "[one of]The activist deftly steps in your way.[or]The activist bobs and gets in your way again. 'We're picketing that building,' she says. 'No entry except for supporters.'[or]This time two friends of the activist appear beside her. 'Supporters only,' they say.[or]The TOXI WASTE power people prevent you. Maybe we'd better listen to what they have to say.[stopping]".
		
Section 2 - Samuel Johnson Hall

South of University Oval is Samuel Johnson Hall. The description of Samuel Johnson Hall is "This is the main building for Language Studies. [one of]This is not to be confused with Language Engineering, which is the department that handles devices for the manipulation of language-objects; it is also not to be confused with Linguistics, English Literature, or Comparative Literature, all of which have their own buildings and faculties. Language Studies applies itself to questions of linguistic efficacy chiefly at a social and anthropological level. 

That's to say that we study how the ability to change things based on their names affects daily life and society.

[or][stopping]The department office, with several professorial offices leading off of it, is to the [southeast]. To the [southwest] is the seminar room, where many of the upper-level courses occur, and which also contains the department library; downstairs is the basement, where the graduate students and junior instructors are kept."

Samuel Johnson Hall is indoors and southern.

Rule for listing exits while in Samuel Johnson Hall:
	do nothing instead.

The framed photograph of Waterstone is a thing in Samuel Johnson Hall. It is fixed in place. "On the wall hangs a [photograph of Waterstone], with the words SHAPLY CHAIR in big letters underneath."  Understand "photo" or "picture" or  "professor" or "frame" as the framed photograph.
	The printed name is "framed photograph of Professor Waterstone".
	The description is "The Shaply Chair is not named after the famous suffragette Phyllida Shaply, but after her considerably less famous or interesting descendant Lawrence Shaply, who was well-placed within Dental Consonants Ltd. when it started up and subsequently had buckets of money with which to endow university chairs. 

Nonetheless, this position is a point of considerable pride for Professor Waterstone, and gets him many invitations to speak both here and abroad, which he takes terribly seriously. (More to the point, the government permits him to attend.)

This may explain the particularly expansive grin on Waterstone's face in this image. Usually his pleasure is expressed more moderately."

Section 3 - Seminar Room

Southwest of Samuel Johnson Hall is the seminar door. The seminar door is a closed lockable locked door.  The seminar door is scenery. The description of the seminar door is "It's sturdy, because sometimes valuable equipment is stored in the room beyond. That room also contains the library of department books, a set of research materials kept on hand so that people don't have to go over to the university library to double-check basic data during a discussion."

Southwest of the seminar door is Language Studies Seminar Room. The description of the Language Studies Seminar Room is "They recently redid this room, and whoever picked the decorations had postmodern tastes." The Language Studies Seminar Room is indoors and southern.

After looking in the Language Studies Seminar Room when the seminar door is open:
	if Higgate is visible:
		continue the action;
	silently try closing the seminar door;
	if the seminar door is closed:
		say "[One of]I shut the door so that [you] don't get interrupted.[or]For safety, I shut the door behind us.[stopping]";
	continue the action.

The Language Studies Seminar Room contains a chair. When play begins: let T be a random chair in the Language Studies Seminar Room; now T is not scenery.

The big table is a supporter in the Language Studies Seminar Room.  "The [big table] at the cen[ter] of the room is an irregular polygon[if exactly one chair is visible and no chair is mentioned], with one [random visible chair] pushed up to the shortest side[end if]."
	The introduction is "I think the shape is intended to undermine traditional conceptions of academic hierarchy, but in practice it  just means that whoever gets to seminar late has to sit with a table angle jabbing him in the stomach."
	The description is "Crafted from some exotic wood with lots of interesting burl structure. There was a wealthy donor behind the construction of this room."

History of the Standards Revolution is a book on the LSR bookcase. The description of History of the Standards Revolution is "It covers in minute detail the process by which the island standard[ize]d spelling and leveraged its linguistic power." The introduction is "[History] is of those bog-standard texts that everyone in my field owns a copy of and uses as a doorstop. Very occasionally something still arises that I need to look up, but I just about memor[ize]d it in preparation for my comprehensive exams."

Lives of the Lexicographers is a book on the LSR bookcase. The description of Lives of the Lexicographers is "It is a substantial history of the major contributors to the art of dictionary-creation, and a useful guide to the specialist bibliography on each figure."

Section 4 - Department Office

The Language Studies Department Office is southeast of Samuel Johnson Hall. 
	"This big, slightly drab area holds such useful objects as the [mailboxes] and [secretary's computer]. On ordinary days the secretary would be in as well, presiding over affairs. The offices of individual professors lie [north] and [west][if Higgate's office door is closed and office-door-1 is closed], though both doors are closed[otherwise if Higgate's office door is closed], though the west door is closed[otherwise if office-door-1 is closed], though the north door is closed[end if]."
	The introduction is "This corner office was won in a battle of wills with several other departments during the most recent rebuilding drive. Professor Waterstone is fond of reminding the others that he was the one to obtain this fav[our]able position whenever there is a disagreement about procedure."
	
Rule for listing exits when looking in the Language Studies Department Office:

The language studies department office is indoors and southern.

The description of the u-shaped desk is "Formidable in size, but even that is not enough to support all of the things that the secretarial staff need to keep track of."

Does the player mean doing something with the secretary's computer:
	it is very likely.

[Instead of switching on the secretary's computer:

Before writing a paragraph about something when the u-shaped desk is in the location:
	now the u-shaped desk is mentioned. [We want "the u-shaped desk" not "a u-shaped desk" or worse "an u-shaped desk".]
	
The department printer is a device on the u-shaped desk. It is fixed in place. The description is "The networked [printer] handles output for all the computers in the department. [printer indicator]." 
	Understand "lights" or "indicator" as the department printer.
	The printed name is "printer".
	The department printer is switched on.
	The introduction is "The use of just one printer sometimes leads to annoying clashes when one person is printing off, say, the draft of a small monograph when someone else wants to make up quizzes for class. But Waterstone insists that it's not worth spending department money on another printer when those funds could go to faculty development grants."
	
Instead of taking the department printer:
	say "It would be a heavy thing to carry around, and I don't see much use for it elsewhere."

Rule for writing a paragraph about the department printer:
	say "[The department printer] also sits on [the u-shaped desk]. [run paragraph on]";
	now the output tray is referenced by the current-paragraph;
	now the paper-drawer is referenced by the current-paragraph;
	if the paper-drawer is open:

	try inserting the noun into the paper-drawer.
	
Instead of closing the department printer:

[Procedural rule while examining the department printer:
	ignore the examine described devices rule. ]

A printer mode is a kind of value. The printer modes are not-on, standby, ready, and out of paper.

A paper-drawer is part of the department printer. The paper-drawer is a container. It is closed and openable and privately-named. The printed name is "paper drawer". Understand "paper-drawer" or "paper drawer" or "drawer" or "clamps" or "clamp" or "plastic clamps" as the paper-drawer. The description is "The paper-drawer slides neatly in (or out) of the body of the printer, and is deep enough to hold a multi-inch stack of fresh paper. A small catch secures it from being carelessly opened[if the paper-drawer is open and the paper-drawer is empty]. Some plastic clamps hold the pages in place inside, when there are any[end if]." Understand "catch" as the paper-drawer.

Instead of pushing or pulling the paper-drawer:
	if the paper-drawer is open:
		try closing the paper-drawer;
	otherwise:
		try opening the paper-drawer.

An output tray is part of the department printer. It is a supporter. The description of the output tray is "In molded plastic, it is an integral part of the printer body[if something is on the output tray]. Currently there [is-are a list of things on the output tray] on the tray, waiting for the owner to come collect[end if]."

Report inserting the ream into the paper-drawer:
	say "The ream fits exactly into the depth of the drawer. [You] adjust the plastic clamps that hold pages in place until everything is snug." instead.

Report closing the paper-drawer:
	say "The paper-drawer slides back into place with a click." instead.
	
Report opening the paper-drawer:
	say "[You] pull up on the little catch and draw the drawer out[if something is in the paper-drawer], revealing [a list of things which are in the paper-drawer][otherwise]. It's empty[end if]." instead.

Instead of putting something on the output tray:
	say "It's probably a bad idea to risk jamming the output tray by putting random things onto it."
	
Instead of putting something fluid on the output tray:
	say "Now that's just vandalism."
	
Test paper-bug with "tutorial off / shutoffice / wave c-remover at cream / open paper-drawer / put ream in drawer / close drawer / z / open drawer / x paper" holding the cream in the Department office.

A draft document is a thing. Understand "pages" or "speech" or "talk" or "asterisks" as the draft document. [Understand "paper" as the draft document when the paper is not visible.] The description is "It's fifteen pages double-spaced, and appears to be the draft of a talk Professor Waterstone is preparing to give at a convention. I immediately notice, however, that several portions of the speech are marked with angry triple asterisks [--] Waterstone's way of marking up parts of text that need serious revision.

The talk concerns 'homonym shame': the anxiety felt in the Victorian era, and still manifested at times in modern culture, about objects that shared the same name as (and therefore theoretically might be converted into) something rude. Methods of disguising the legs of pianos and crotches of trees occupy a good portion of Waterstone's exposition, and there is a page-long aside on methods of  making sure that donkeys are known by that name and not by the alternative. 

To judge, however, from the angry asterisking, Waterstone is still looking for at least one more example of an object susceptible to double-entendre that has been successfully rendered innocent by some linguistic modification."

The draft document can be pending. The draft document is not pending.

Every turn when the draft document is pending and the current printer mode is ready:
	move the draft document to the output tray;
	now the draft document is not pending;
	move the single ream to the repository;
	move the blank-paper to the paper-drawer;
	say "The printer whirs as though clearing its throat, and then begins to spit pages rapidly into the output tray."

To say printer indicator:
	if the current printer mode is:
		-- not-on:
			say "All the indicator lights are dark";
		-- standby:
			say "The indicator lights glow amber for standby mode";
		-- out of paper:
			say "The indicator lights glow red to indicate that the paper-drawer is empty";
		-- ready:
			say "The indicator lights glow green with readiness";
	if the draft document is pending and the printer mode is not not-on:
		say ". An additional light indicates that some document is in the queue to print and is waiting for the printer to [if the current printer mode is not ready]be ready[otherwise]start, which should happen any minute[end if]"

To decide what printer mode is the current printer mode:
	if the department printer is switched off:
		decide on not-on;
	if the paper-drawer is open:
		decide on standby;
	if the number of things in the paper-drawer is zero:
		decide on out of paper;
	decide on ready.
		
Report switching on the printer:
	say "[You] switch the printer on. The lights all come on and flash a few times while it warms itself up. Then things settle down. [printer indicator]." instead.

Sanity-check writing the topic understood on the blank-paper:
	say "Writing on the paper would ruin it for the printer." instead.

A blank-paper is a thing. The printed name is "blank paper". Understand "blank paper" or "blank" or "paper" as the blank-paper. The indefinite article is "some". The description is "Having lost a few pages, there is no longer a ream, but there's still enough here to keep the printer going for a while." Understand "pages" as the blank-paper. 

Instead of taking the blank-paper:
	say "Might as well leave it there for future users."

Check inserting something into the paper-drawer:
	if the noun is the ream:
		continue the action;
	if the noun is the blank-paper:
		continue the action;
	otherwise:
		say "Only fresh printer paper can safely go into the paper-drawer, and it must be the right size and in quantities of no more than a ream." instead.

The mailboxes are a scenery container. 
	Understand "mailbox" as the mailboxes.
	Instead of searching the mailboxes, say "No need: it will be the usual assortment of advertisements from academic presses, copies of the campus newspaper (which are never interesting and always get discarded), memos from the dean with no informational content whatsoever, and so on."

The description of the mailboxes is "There are slots for all the professors and graduate students. Undergraduates, of course, are too insignificant to be assigned mailboxes, and are not allowed to have mail delivered to the department."

Instead of doing something in the presence of Higgate when the noun is the synthesizer or the second noun is the synthesizer or the noun is the plexiglas case or the noun is the screws or the second noun is the plexiglas case or the second noun is the screws:
	say "Higgate may be a little unworldly, but there is no way she'd let us mess with the synthesizer without interference. We'll have to hope she is willing to leave us in here."

Instead of going somewhere when the location is the Seminar Room and Higgate is in the location:
	say "[You] got in here on the pretext of putting the book away. It would be odd to leave again without doing so."

After putting the Problem of Adjectives on the LSR Bookcase:
	say "[You] take a moment to find the proper place for the book.

The sound of discussion comes from down the hall: two voices speaking in Lojban, and then a male voice interrupting. 'Do you have a lic[ense] for this conversation?' it asks.

'Excuse me,' Higgate says. 'I'd better go see to that.'";
	try Higgate approaching higgate's office;
	reset the interlocutor;

	otherwise:
		clear the path-walked for the player;
	if higgate-arrested has happened:
		say "The door is sealed with Bureau tape. Evidently they are planning to search more carefully later." instead;
	say "[one of][You] open the door to find two students, a boy and a girl, sitting at Higgate's table. The boy is sipping tea and the girl is paging madly through the Lojban book. 'Oh,' says Higgate. 'You found what you needed, I hope? I'm afraid [you] [are] busy now.'
	
So I duck us back out and close the door[or]I don't think [you] need anything else, and it would be mean to interrupt their tea again[stopping].".  

Instead of listening to Higgate's office door when Higgate's office door is closed:
	if higgate-arrested has happened:
		say "Dead silence." instead;
	say "Putting our ear to the door, [you] hear [one of]a girl's voice stumbling over a question[or]Professor Higgate saying something rapid and fluent[or]a boy laughing[stopping]." 

Higgate's Office is west of Higgate's office door. "Higgate got about 30% finished with a stylish decorating scheme and then got distracted, leaving everything in a unsettled state. A few of her books are arranged on a very nice [rosewood bookshelf], which looks Asian[if the small figurines are on the bookshelf] and is ornamented with [small figurines][end if]; all the rest of her library is stacked higgledy-piggledy in [plastic cartons]."

The rosewood bookshelf is a supporter in Higgate's Office. It is scenery. Some small figurines are on the rosewood bookshelf. The small figurines are scenery. The description of the small figurines is "They depict mostly characters from popular children's fiction: Professor Higgate has a particularly strong and inexplicable fetish for the Wizard of Oz."

Instead of waving the letter-remover at the paint when the paint is retained:
	say "Higgate might mind our modifying her stuff without permission." ]
	
When play begins:
	let N be a random chair in Higgate's Office;
	move Professor Higgate to N.
	
Rule for writing a topic sentence about Professor Higgate when Higgate is on a chair (called the special-target):

Rule for disclosing exterior of Professor Higgate when Professor Higgate is on a chair:
	do nothing instead.

Professor Higgate is an alert woman in Higgate's Office. 
	The description is "Professor Higgate is about forty-five, very tall and slim, with a short, no-nonsense hairstyle. Indeed everything about her self-presentation suggests that she has studied how to make herself acceptably professional in the shortest possible time each day, and now adheres to this plan with absolute rigor. 
	
What she might look like in some other setting, such as on a date or at a formal dinner, is beyond my ability to imagine."
	The introduction is "Higgate is the second reader on my dissertation committee, and a conlang expert [--] that is, Constructed Languages. It was a seminar with her that really got me thinking about utopian linguistics, and she's been very supportive, though cautious[if Professor Waterstone is introduced]. She and Professor Waterstone don't always get along that well[end if]."
	
The oval table is a privately-named supporter in Higgate's Office. It supports a book called Complete Lojban. Understand "table" or "oval table" as the oval table. [Disambiguate from University Oval in GO TO commands.]

The description of Complete Lojban is "The book is bound in an ugly yellow binding and has a number of small sticky notes sticking out of it." Complete Lojban is improper-named.
	The introduction of Complete Lojban is "I used to have a copy of this myself: it's uninventively called [i]Complete Lojban[/i] and appeared with about a dozen similar texts in our conlang survey seminar."
	Understand "ugly" and "yellow" and "binding" and "small sticky notes" and "sticky notes" and "notes" as Complete Lojban.

Rule for printing the name of Complete Lojban when Complete Lojban is not proper-named: say "[roman type]ugly yellow book"

The oval table supports a book called Heart to Heart. Understand "romance" or "novel" as Heart to Heart.

The description of Heart to Heart is "The cover shows two women in a steamy embrace, so I'm going to guess it's a romance novel. As language is one I haven't ever learned, I can't read the title." Heart to Heart is improper-named.

Rule for printing the name of Heart to Heart: say "[roman type]romance novel in some heavily accented language".

Instead of taking something which is on the oval table:
	say "Professor Higgate frowns as [you] reach for [the noun]. 'You may have noticed,' she says, in the kind of voice that always withered our hearts in seminar, 'that there are certain social expectations about touching the possessions of other people.'

My fingers relax their grip instinctively."


lsr-key unlocks seminar door. lsr-key is carried by Higgate. The printed name of the lsr-key is "small key". Understand "small" as the lsr-key.

Rule for deciding the concealed possessions of Higgate:

Report Professor Higgate saying hello to the player:
	if Higgate recollects that we do not speak Lojban, queue English-greeting instead;
	otherwise queue lojban-greeting instead.
	
Section 6 - Waterstone's Office

North of the Language Studies Department Office is office-door-1. office-door-1 is a privately-named open lockable scenery door. The printed name of office-door-1 is "Waterstone's office door".

The description of office-door-1 is "Unlike most office doors, it has a [special glass window] in it allowing Waterstone to survey everything that goes on outside even when he is locked in."

Instead of knocking on special glass window:
	try knocking on office-door-1.

Does the player mean searching office-door-1:
	it is very likely.

Instead of searching office-door-1:

		yes;
	no. 
	 

Instead of knocking on office-door-1 when the location of Professor Waterstone is Waterstone's Office and office-door-1 is closed and the location is Language Studies Department Office:

The water-reaction rules are an object-based rulebook.
		
A Water-reaction rule for a Waterstone-inspiring thing (called the target):
	say "Waterstone looks at [the target], briefly arrested by some thought. He gets a monocle like mine out of his drawer. He looks through it at [the target], notes [the list of things which proffer the target]; grins. ";

'This is perfect,' Waterstone says. 'One more example to put into my talk [--] but I really should be going [--] should be able to get a ride from my wife [--] if I leave now [--] Here, you can have this if it interests you. I won't have time to use it.' He sets an invitation down on the desk. 

'Come back and talk to me again later,' he adds. 'We can discuss your goals as a student. And now I really have to go [--] should have gone hours ago.' (There, see: he can be a nice man. More or less.)

A Water-reaction rule for the passage when the ass does not proffer the passage:
	say "[one of]Waterstone looks at the passage, briefly arrested by some thought. He gets a monocle like mine out of his drawer. He looks through it at the passage. 

But what he sees disappoints him, and he shoves the monocle away again. He writes something on a paper and holds it up: 'Good thought [--] P-ASS-AGE [--] but it must have been genuinely constructed from [']ass['], not cobbled from [a list of things that proffer the passage]. Can't cite it.' 

This is an awful lot of writing; why the man can't come to the door and hold a conversation I don't know. But that's Waterstone for you[or]He checks the passage again, then shakes his head in disappointment when he sees it's not made with genuine ass[stopping].";
	rule succeeds.
	
A Water-reaction rule for the cock-ring:
	say "Waterstone sees what [you][']ve made of the cock, and clutches desperately at his hair as though he's going to tear it out in tufts. His eyes bulge and water. I've never seen the man so close to apoplexy.

A last Water-reaction rule for something (called the target):
	say "[one of]Waterstone looks up from his work long enough to give us an irritated glare.[or]Waterstone barely glances away from his typing this time.[or]Without looking up, Waterstone sticks out his tongue.

	rule succeeds.

Sanity-check saying hello to Professor Waterstone when Professor Waterstone is enclosed by Waterstone's Office and office-door-1 is closed and the location is Language Studies Department Office:

	say "Though there is a window and Waterstone can watch the outer office from his desk, he is unable to hear you through the closed door, which is presumably the purpose of closing it. I will try knocking instead.";
	now held-over-object is the noun;
	try knocking on office-door-1.
	
Instead of giving something to office-door-1 when Professor Waterstone is enclosed by Waterstone's Office and office-door-1 is closed and the location is Language Studies Department Office:
	say "Waterstone is unable to hear you through the closed door, which is presumably the purpose of closing it, so let's try knocking instead.";
	now held-over-object is the noun;
	try knocking on office-door-1.

A special glass window is part of office-door-1. The description of the special glass window is "It's nearly the width of the door, and fills most of the upper half of the frame."

After deciding the scope of player when the player is in Language Studies Department Office:
	place Waterstone's Office in scope.
	
A description-concealing rule when the location is the Language Studies Department Office:
	now everything which is enclosed by Waterstone's Office is not marked for listing.
	
Report Professor Waterstone closing office-door-1:
	say "The office door closes with measured firmness behind us." instead.
	
Report Professor Waterstone locking office-door-1 with something:
	say "Through the window in Waterstone's door, [you] can see him turning the lock. When he catches us watching he gives a tight, unfriendly smile and goes back to his desk." instead.

Instead of searching the special glass window when office-door-1 is closed:
	if the location is Waterstone's Office:
		say "It's amazing what a great view there is."; [this actually should never happen because we shouldn't wind up trapped with W.]
	otherwise:
		if Professor Waterstone is enclosed by Waterstone's Office:
			say "Though he can easily see us through the office door window, Professor Waterstone resolutely ignores our impolite staring. He's trying to get something done on his laptop, but keeps stopping to stare at the screen or, apparently, to curse at it.";
		otherwise:
			say "Waterstone's office looks oddly bare now that the man himself is gone."

Instead of searching the special glass window when office-door-1 is open:
	say "[You] get a view of the wall behind the door, which is not terribly exciting."

Waterstone's Office is north of office-door-1. It is an office. It is privately-controlled and southern.

The description of Waterstone's Office is "A very finicky, neatly arranged room, in which one never feels quite at home.".

Rule for writing a paragraph about a desk (called target) which is in Waterstone's office:
	say "There is an almost bare desk[if something is on the target], which at the moment supports [a list of things on the target][end if]." Waterstone's Office is indoors.

[Waterstone is not based on any department chair I've worked for, nor on my own advisor (all of whom have been thoroughly nice people).]

Professor Waterstone is an alert man in Waterstone's Office. 
	The description of Waterstone is "Waterstone is in many respects a brilliant man, but he also has a spectacular capacity for ticking people off. He has a dry, off-beat sense of hum[our] whose output is often indistinguishable from insult; he is also convinced that he knows best about most topics of policy, which brings him into frequent disagreement with his colleagues, the dean, and (we hear) his wife.".
	The introduction of Waterstone is "Waterstone is my dissertation advisor. (He insists on the 'o' spelling.) He's an expert in the history of linguistic and orthographical power, but he's politically kind of reactionary. 'Don't meddle' is pretty much his motto[if Professor Higgate is introduced]. He and Professor Higgate don't always get along that well[end if]."

od-key unlocks office-door-1. od-key is carried by Waterstone. 

Rule for deciding the concealed possessions of Waterstone:
	if the particular possession is the od-key:
		yes.

Report Professor Waterstone saying hello to the player:
	if Waterstone does not recollect W-identifies, queue W-identifies;
	otherwise say "'Hello[one of] again[or][at random],' Waterstone says.";
	stop the action.
	 
When play begins:
	let target be a random desk which is in Waterstone's Office;
	move the invitation to the target;
	move the small laptop to the target;
	let new target be a random chair which is in waterstone's office;
	move Professor Waterstone to the new target.

An invitation is a thing. The heft of the invitation is 1.
The description of the invitation is "It is a white card, like a wedding invitation, with swirly script lettering. 'You are invited,' it says, '[waterstone-invited]to a demonstration of a new T-inserter not available to the general public [--] Serial Comma Day [--] Bureau of Orthography.' 

Smaller, meaner sans-serif lettering across the bottom adds: 'Bring this card for admission.'"
	The introduction is "It's from Dental Consonants Limited. Their design of stationery is unmistakable."
	Understand "lettering" or "invite" or "stationery" as the invitation.
	
Instead of taking the invitation when the location is Waterstone's Office:
	say "We reach out our hand. He watches us the way a bird of prey might watch the twitching of a small garden snake. Our hand retracts. We do not take the invitation."

Instead of examining something when the location of the noun is not the location and the heft of the noun is 1:
	say "It's hard to get a good look at [the noun] from this distance."
	 
A small laptop is a laptop. The description is "It goes everywhere with Waterstone and is grimy with long use, but still functional." It is open and switched on.

Section 7 - Samuel Johnson Basement


Below Samuel Johnson Hall is Samuel Johnson Basement. The description of Samuel Johnson Basement is "Dank and malod[our]ous: there are no windows down here, and the drainage is terrible. 

The stairs [up] are here; the lecture room at the [east]. Immediately [south] is the Graduate Student Office, and [southwest] is Professor Brown's office. The most interesting of all is the small door west, trying to look inconspicuous, but locked with a keycard lock: it's where the department stores its most dangerous licensed equipment[if the small door is open]. At the moment it stands invitingly open[end if]."

Rule for listing exits while looking in Samuel Johnson Basement: 
	do nothing instead.

Instead of smelling Samuel Johnson Basement, say "The distinctive scent of mildew, no doubt a result of the endless flooding and re-flooding of this corridor." Samuel Johnson Basement is indoors and southern.


The small door is west of Samuel Johnson Basement. The small door is a door. It is closed and locked. It is scenery. The description of the small door is "It has no label, only a keycard-reading lock.".  

Report unlocking the small door with something:
	say "[You] unlock the small door with a swipe of [the second noun]." instead.

The keycard-reading lock is a container. It is part of the small door. The description is "It looks high-tech: all black plastic, and a slot to swipe a keycard through." Understand "slot" or "keycard lock" as the keycard-reading lock. 

Instead of inserting something into the keycard-reading lock:
	say "[The noun] won't fit." 
	
Instead of inserting the keycard into the keycard-reading lock:
	try unlocking the small door with the keycard. 
	
Instead of inserting the card into the keycard-reading lock: 
	try unlocking the small door with the noun. 

Instead of inserting the passcard into the keycard-reading lock:
	try unlocking the small door with the noun.

Instead of inserting the pass into the keycard-reading lock:
	try unlocking the small door with the noun.

Understand "swipe [something]" as taking. 
Understand "swipe [keycard]" as swiping. Swiping is an action applying to one thing. 

Check swiping:
	if the player cannot see the keycard-reading lock:
		say "There's nothing here to read it with." instead.
	
Carry out swiping:
	try unlocking the small door with the keycard instead.
	
Understand "swipe [keycard] in/through [something]" as inserting it into.

Instead of unlocking the small door with the card: 
	say "It slides through the lock, but of course it doesn't have a magnetic unlocking stripe, so this does no good. [You] need more of a keycard."

Instead of unlocking the small door with the passcard: 
	say "It slides through the lock, but since the information it encodes is passport information, not a key code, the door does not open."

Instead of unlocking the small door with the pass: 
	say "This is the sort of pass that you show to people in order to gain access to places. What [you] need is more of a hard plastic keycard."
	
[Originally a "large box", but the risk of having it become a large ox was too great -- it would be easy to implement the transformation but hard to make it fair to the player if the box were to move from its appointed position.]

A large carton is a container in Samuel Johnson Basement. It is fixed in place. Understand "recycling" as the large carton. "A large open carton stands against the wall right between Brown's lab door and [if the rectification room is visited]the Rectification Room[otherwise]the interesting door[end if][if the carton-sign is part of the carton]. 'Recycling,' reads the sign over the carton. 'Place your lab-created items here for processing.'[otherwise].[end if]". 

The carton-sign is a sign. The carton-sign is part of the carton. The printed name is "sign". Understand "sign" as the carton-sign. The description is "'Recycling. Place your lab-created items here for processing.'"

In the large carton is a banana. The banana is edible. It is a vegetable. The description of the banana is "Just beginning to get brown and spotty."

Instead of going to the Rectification Room when the large carton does not contain something noisy:
	let N be the number of entries in the path so far of the player;
	if N is greater than 1: 
		say "[path-walked so far]";
	otherwise:
		clear the path-walked for the player; 
	say "[one of]Before [you] go through the door to the Rectification Room, it occurs to us that Professor Brown is just next door, and that he is likely to be able to hear if [you] do anything in there. Possibly some kind of masking noise is in order[or][if the player carries something noisy (called the mask)][The mask] do[es] make noise, but you figure we should leave it out here in the hallway so that it will be louder than whatever we do in the room[otherwise]I defer to your judgment that [you] ought to provide some masking sound before proceeding[end if][stopping].". 
	
Instead of dropping something in Samuel Johnson Basement when the heft of the noun is less than 4:
	say "I'll just leave [that-those of noun] in the carton; less likely to be disturbed there.";
	try inserting the noun into the large carton;

After dropping something noisy in the large carton:
	say "[You] set [the noun] in the carton, where [it-they] ought to provide a helpful distraction for the time being." 
	
Understand "recycle [something]" as recycling. Recycling is an action applying to one carried thing. 
Sanity-check recycling a person:
	say "[The noun] might not take kindly to that." instead.
Check recycling something when the large carton is not visible:
	say "There's no place to recycle [the noun]." instead.
Carry out recycling something:
	try inserting the noun into the large carton instead.
	
Section 8 - Rectification Room

The Rectification Room is west of the small door. It is indoors and southern. The description is "This is where equipment is brought for a tune-up, or to have its legal limits reinstalled (or, on rare occasions, removed). Access to these abilities is tightly controlled by the Bureau."

Instead of switching on the reclamation machine:
	try switching on the reclamation computer.
	
Instead of switching off the reclamation machine:
	try switching off the reclamation computer.

The reclamation machine is a closed openable fixed in place container in the Rectification Room. 
	The introduction is "It's very ordinary looking, a simple machine with leads able to attach to various linguistic equipment, and to read and rewrite the programming."
	The initial appearance is "[The reclamation machine] stands near the door, ready to improve forbidden objects for the use of registered departmental users."
	The description is "You put a piece of linguistic equipment into the reclamation machine and the machine reprograms it. Attached to the machine is a computer which manages its behavi[our][if the reclamation machine is closed]. Currently the machine is closed: I assume [you] use the computer to open it for service[end if]."
	
Instead of opening the reclamation machine:
	say "The opening is controlled by the computer portion of the machine. It can't just be forced open."
	
The reclamation computer is a computer. It is part of the reclamation machine. One trackpad is part of the reclamation computer.

The reclamation computer is running a password lock program called reclamation security.
	The password of reclamation security is "4tsaj39nbtz".
	
The reclamation computer is running an enumerated multiple-choice program called the reclamations operation program.
	The options table of the reclamations operation program is the table of deeds.
	The description of the reclamations operation program  is "At the top of the screen is the message STATUS: [if the reclamation machine is closed and the reclamation machine is limit-replacing]STANDBY[otherwise if reclamation machine is abstract-removing]REMOVING ABSTRACTION LIMITS[otherwise if reclamation machine is abstract-replacing]RESTORING ABSTRACTION LIMITS[otherwise if the reclamation machine is limit-replacing]RESTORING LEGAL LIMITS ON ANIMAL-CREATION[otherwise]REMOVING LEGAL LIMITS ON ANIMAL-CREATION[end if].
	
[options-list of the item described]".
	
The reclamation machine can be limit-removing, limit-replacing, abstract-removing or abstract-replacing.

[Don't put other stuff in the bin]
	
Instead of inserting something which is not the  letter-remover into the reclamation machine when the heft of the noun is greater than 2:
	say "That would be pointless, and even if it weren't, [the noun] won't fit into the reclamation machine."
	
Instead of inserting something which is not the letter-remover into the reclamation machine: 
	say "The reclamation machine wouldn't be able to make much of [the noun], and there's always the risk of attracting undesired attention."
	
[Response to 1: add abstract limits]

Report inserting the letter-remover into the reclamation machine when the letter-remover was not upgraded and the reclamation machine is abstract-replacing:

Section 9 - Graduate Student Office
	

South of Samuel Johnson Basement is the Graduate Student Office. The description of the Graduate Student Office is "A small windowless room divided into cubicles for individual graduate students." Graduate Student Office is indoors and southern.

A tiny refrigerator is a refrigerator in the Graduate Student Office. The tiny refrigerator is not scenery. The fridge-top is part of the tiny refrigerator. It is a supporter.  The scent-description of the tiny refrigerator is "onions".

On the fridge-top is a coffee-maker. The coffee-maker is a device. A coffee-pot is part of the coffee-maker. The coffee-pot is a container. Understand "coffee pot" or "coffeepot" as the coffee-pot. Understand "coffee maker" or "coffeemaker" or "maker" or "coffee" as the coffee-maker. The scent-description of the coffee-maker is "damp, aging coffee grounds".

Instead of switching on the coffee-maker:
	say "[You] don't have time to go brewing ourselves a pot, but I can set your mind at rest on one point anyway: it generally comes out horrible."

A ranking rule for the tiny refrigerator: 
	increase the description-rank of the tiny refrigerator by 100.    
	
After printing the name of the silver platter while writing a paragraph about the tiny refrigerator:
	if something is on the silver platter:
		if at least two things are on the silver platter:
			say " (littered with [if the shrimp tail is on the silver platter]the remains of a party, including [end if][a list of things on the silver platter])[run paragraph on]";
		otherwise:
			say " bearing [a list of things on the silver platter][run paragraph on]".

Rule for writing a paragraph about the tiny refrigerator:
	say "A [tiny refrigerator] stores lunches (sometimes) and looted leftovers from department receptions (when available)";
	if the tiny refrigerator is open:
		say ". The door is currently open[if something is in the tiny refrigerator], revealing [a list of things in the tiny refrigerator][end if]";
	say "[if something is on the fridge-top]. On top of the fridge there [is-are a list of things on the fridge-top][end if].";
	say line break.
	
Instead of putting something on the tiny refrigerator:
	try putting the noun on the fridge-top.

The description of the coffee-maker is "It's the cheapest possible variety, donated by one of the older students, and it is constantly overflowing and needing to be taken away to be cleaned of loose grounds. But it does work, more or less, most of the time."

In the tiny refrigerator is a cream. The indefinite article of the cream is "some". The description of the cream is "Kept around to go with the coffee. It doesn't seem to have gone off yet, which is a wonder." The cream is edible, contained, and fluid. 
	

In the tiny refrigerator is a silver platter. The heft of the silver platter is 2. On the silver platter is a crumpled cocktail napkin and a shrimp tail.
	The description of the silver platter is "Evidently the platter is left over from a department function, and no one has bothered with doing the dishes."
	The silver platter is portable.
	The description of the shrimp tail is "There's no meat left; just the remains of one shrimp tail with the flesh bitten off."
	The description of the crumpled cocktail napkin is "It's trash. Why it wound up being archived in the refrigerator is anyone's guess."

A ranking rule for the cubicle: 
	increase the description-rank of the cubicle by 25.
	 

The cubicle is a fixed in place enterable open container in the Graduate Student Office. It is not openable.
	The description is "Little more than a [swivel-chair] and a [built-in desk], now."
	The introduction is "I cleared everything subversive out of there ages ago, and now I do most of my work at home in the apartment. It's safer that way."

Rule for writing a topic sentence about the cubicle:
	say "My cubicle is the one with [the swivel-chair], towards the back of the room by [the water cooler]. [no line break]" 
	
A built-in desk is a desk. It is part of the cubicle. 

A swivel-chair is in the cubicle. It is a chair. Understand "chair" as the swivel-chair. 
	The description is "It is grey with small white dots on the fabric."
	The introduction is "I bought the swivel-chair with my own money, because sitting on the plastic bucket seat supplied by the department made my legs sticky in the summer."
	
[In an earlier version of the game, there's an NPC hanging around the department who no longer appears: a grad student with a long-running crush on Alex, which he's never quite reciprocated. He's not that into her, and anyway, he keeps figuring he's going to leave the island and doesn't want to get into a relationship. 

That element didn't tie into any puzzles and so felt kind of purposeless and unbalanced (and even from a story perspective, she had no special reason to be in the department on a holiday, and Alexandra had no reason to be talking to her when there's this important getting away to do).

So I cut the character, leaving only this covert element, a message of solidarity and warning that she's left behind.]
	
The sticky is a thing on the swivel-chair. The description is "[i]Please be careful. The blue hats are watching you.[/i]". Understand "writing" or "message" or "handwriting" or "note" or "warning" as the sticky.
	The introduction is "I half recogn[ize] the handwriting, but I'm having trouble placing it. One of the other grad students, but I'm not sure which."

Instead of putting the sticky on something which is not a supporter:
	say "[The sticky] doesn't have enough gumminess left to stick to anything new."

The water cooler is fixed in place in the Graduate Student Office. The description is "Perpetually empty because no one down here can be bothered to go up to the office, demand a refill, and lug the replacement bottle down the stairs."

Instead of drinking the water cooler:
	say "The water cooler does not contain any water at the moment."
	
Section 10 - Brown's Lab

Southwest of Samuel Johnson Basement is Brown's Lab. Brown's Lab is indoors and southern.

Sanity-check going to Brown's Lab when Higgate-arrested has happened:
	say "The whole area is likely under inspection after Brown's little Judas act back there. Who knew he had it in him? Is he seriously expecting to get her position?" instead.
	
Sanity-check approaching Brown's Lab when Higgate-arrested has happened:
	say "The whole area is likely under inspection after Brown's little Judas act back there. Who knew he had it in him? Is he seriously expecting to get her position?" instead.

The work table is scenery in Brown's Lab. The description is "It is a high green-covered counter, like those found in a physics laboratory."

On the work table is an electrical equipment. The electrical equipment is fixed in place. The indefinite article of the electrical equipment is "some". The flexible appearance of the electrical equipment is "A mare's nest of electrical equipment occupies most of the top of [the work table]." Understand "mare's" or "nest" or "metal" or "digital" or "readouts" or "boxes" or "wires" or "readout" or "box" or "wire" or "series" or "series of" as the electrical equipment.

The description of the electrical equipment is "A series of metal boxes with digital readouts and wires that lead in and out."

The introduction of the electrical equipment is "Brown uses this stuff to measure the amount of energy it requires to reify abstract concepts such as 'talk'. He has a theory, apparently, that by measuring the minute variations of input energy required to create these items, he can establish baseline indications about how much certain words are used by English-speakers worldwide; ten, fifty, or a hundred years from now, this data will allow researchers to determine whether these same words have become more or less popular relative to other words.

It's a little weird. Abstract reifications are one of the absolute coolest things in language studies[if higgate is as-yet-unknown],[otherwise] [--] Professor Higgate calls them the dark matter of language [--][end if] but Brown has managed to pick the very most boring research project to perform on them, and one which moreover is guaranteed to prevent him having any results worth publishing any time in the next two decades. 

This pretty much sums up everything you need to know about the guy."

Professor Brown is an alert man in Brown's Lab. "[Professor Brown], the Reification of Abstracts researcher, is [if Brown is in Brown's Lab]hunched over his work table[else]standing around awkwardly[end if]."

The introduction is "Brown is only barely a professor at all [--] actually, his working title is Senior Lecturer, and he holds a yearly contract which the University has the option to renew at whim. This prevents him going elsewhere while ensuring that he never has a fully-funded lab of his own. All [the electrical equipment] down here is tinker-toys compared to the stuff he really wants; in fact, half of it he built himself with components he bought with his own money.

I know all this because Brown cornered me in the hallway one afternoon and talked to me for twenty minutes straight about the pressures of academic job-hunting in the current political climate. I tried to get him to stop, but he's like a wind-up toy."

The description of Professor Brown is "He's going bald on top [--] prematurely, because I think he's only 28 or so [--] so, to compensate, he's grown a goofy little [goatee]."


Check waving the letter-remover at goatee when the current setting of the letter-remover is "e":
	if letter-remover is creature-enabled:
		say "Oh so tempting. You're not the first person to think of it, trust me. The undergrads have a whole sideline in Professor Brown caricature where he has a goat coming out of his face. But if we succeeded, we'd get arrested, and Brown could be seriously injured. I can't go along with that." instead;
	else:
		say "Brown's facial hair is currently saved by the fact that we couldn't generate a goat with this letter-remover." instead.
	
Test goatee with "wave e-remover at goatee / autoupgrade / wave e-remover at goatee" in Brown's Lab.

The goatee is part of Professor Brown. The description is "It fails to conceal Professor Brown's lack of personal charisma."

Report Professor Brown saying hello to the player:
	say "'Don't touch anything, please,' he says, without looking up." instead.

Professor Brown wears steel-rimmed spectacles and a worn leather jacket. The description of the steel-rimmed spectacles is "They have tiny oval lenses, tinted green."

The introduction of the steel-rimmed spectacles is "Brown seems to be simultaneously cultivating the image of rebel (age 17) and absent-minded professor (age 65)."

The description of the worn leather jacket is "A moderately cool sort of bomber-jacket look, except that the elbows have given out and the cuffs are unraveling."

Lecture Hall 1 is east of Samuel Johnson Basement. "The main lecture hall used for large survey courses in language studies offered to undergraduates. I sat through courses here when I was an undergraduate myself, and have now delivered a few lectures as a teaching assistant." Lecture Hall 1 is indoors and southern.

After deciding the scope of the player when in Lecture Hall 1:
	place the wooden seats in scope.

Rule for listing exits when looking in Lecture Hall 1: do nothing instead.

The printed name is "Lecture Hall (at the podium)". Understand "podium" or "at podium" or "at the podium" or "(at podium)" or "(at the podium)" as Lecture Hall 1.

The podium is a supporter in Lecture Hall 1. It is scenery. The description is "An advanced, pre-wired [podium] that allows the instructor to project slides from a laptop or show movies."

On the podium is a page. The page is a notepad. The description of the page is "A sheet of lined paper[if the location is Lecture Hall 1], presumably left by the person who lectured here last[end if]."
	The memo of the page is "visual[ization] training... preparation at a young age... cooperative direction of language outcomes".
	The allowed-pens of the page is { pen, pens }.

A description-concealing rule when the page is marked for listing:
	if the page is not seen and the page is not handled:
		now the page is not marked for listing.
		
A ranking rule for the page when the page is on the podium:
	increase the description-rank of the page by 40.

Rule for writing a topic sentence about the page when the page is on the podium:
	say "Some previous lecturer has left [a page] on [the podium]. [run paragraph on]"
		
Test page with "tutorial off / look / x podium / look" in Lecture Hall 1.

The conference poster is a fixed in place thing in Lecture Hall 1. Understand "title" or "papyrus" or "font" or "daguerreotype" or "catchy" or "portly woman" or "speakers" or "pictures" or "inset" or "waterstone" as the conference poster.
	"A poster at the front of the room announces a conference on cultural reactions to linguistic change. It is being held in Nice the day after tomorrow, with Professor Waterstone as keynote speaker, on the topic of 'homonym shame'."
	The introduction is "Somehow I had forgotten about the date of this: I've been too much worried about our escape."
	The description is "It's the usual sort of thing: the conference title set in Papyrus font; a stock daguerreotype of a portly woman holding a letter-remover the size of a policeman's cosh; inset pictures of the major speakers, with pride of place for Waterstone himself."

[After we've changed the poster once, it should stop being stuck in place.]
A dangerous destruction rule for the conference poster:
	now the conference poster is not fixed in place;
	now the initial appearance of the conference poster is "A conference poster lies curled on the ground.";
	now the description of the conference poster is "The poster announces a conference on cultural reactions to linguistic change. It is being held in Nice the day after tomorrow, with Professor Waterstone as keynote speaker, on the topic of 'homonym shame'. It's the usual sort of thing: the conference title set in Papyrus font; a stock daguerreotype of a portly woman holding a letter-remover the size of a policeman's cosh; inset pictures of the major speakers, with pride of place for Waterstone himself.".

Sanity-check looking under the conference poster when the conference poster is fixed in place:
	say "That would be hard to do without ripping it off the wall." instead.
 
Lecture Hall 2 is south of Lecture Hall 1. The printed name is "Lecture Hall (among the seats)". Understand "seats" or "among the seats" or "among seats" or "(among seats)" or "(among the seats)" as Lecture Hall 2. Lecture Hall 2 is indoors and southern.
	The description is "Many are the fine hours I have spent here dozing; and many are the students of mine who have done the same. The circle of life becomes complete."
	
	
Some wooden seats are supporters in Lecture Hall 2. Understand "hard" or "wood" as the wooden seats. "The room extends [if Location is Lecture Hall 1]south[otherwise]north[end if], full of hard [wooden seats]." The description is "Ingeniously uncomfortable."



Rule for disclosing contents of the wooden seats when at least one mentionable thing is on the wooden seats:
	say "Abandoned on one near the back [is-are a list of mentionable things on the wooden seats]. [run paragraph on]"

A coat is on the wooden seats. The coat is floppy and wearable. It covers the torso-area. The description is "It's been abandoned here for a while, since this isn't the time of year when people wear coats. It's brown cloth, only thick enough to keep out rain or a mild chill, and it's rubbed shiny at the elbows. No wonder the owner didn't miss it much." The heft of the coat is 2. Understand "brown coat" or "brown cloth" as the coat.

The scent-description of the coat is "dust and a faintest lingering trace of men's cologne".


The course advertisement is a fixed in place thing in Lecture Hall 2. Understand "ad" or "interlingua" as course advertisement.
	"Someone has taped to the wall a [course advertisement] for next quarter, inviting interested undergraduates to enroll in Interlingua 101."  	

The description of the course advertisement is "In large type:
	
[b]Interlingua 101: Learn a Language You Already Know.[/b]
	
In smaller type beneath: [i]Interlingua se basa a parolas international, preponderentemente de origine latin, que ha supervivite a nostre dies, e que existe in italiano, espaniol/portugese, francese e anglese (linguas de referentia) plus germano e russo como reserva. Le grammatica del interlingua es un rationalisate synthese del grammaticas de referentia.[/i]

And then as a final tagline: INTERLINGUA IS THE MODERN LATIN.".
	The introduction is "Probably Professor Higgate's work."
	
Instead of taking the course advertisement, say "It has been stuck to the wall with so much tape that [you] probably couldn't remove it without tearing it."

[Before doing something in Lecture Hall 1 when the noun is on the seats or the second noun is on the seats:
	say "(first wending our way among the seats)[command clarification break]";
	try going south;
	if the location is Lecture Hall 1:
		stop the action.]

The Campus is a region. University Oval, [Grimy Staircase 1, Grimy Staircase 2,] Samuel Johnson Hall, Higgate's Office, Waterstone's Office, the Language Studies Department Office, Samuel Johnson Basement, Graduate Student Office, Lecture Hall 1, Lecture Hall 2, Brown's Lab, Rectification Room, and the Language Studies Seminar Room are in Campus.

Book 4 - Act IV Among Policemen

Part 1 - The Bureau

Chapter 1 - The Bureau and Environs

Section 1 - Tall Street

East of Roundabout is Tall Street. Tall Street is a southern road. "Tall Street is very quiet. No celebrations have reached this far, and neither is there any business today; so it has an air of dull abandonment. At the [east] end the street bends to go around an old park rarely visited."
The distant-rotunda is scenery in Tall Street. It is distant. The printed name is "rotunda". Understand "rotunda" and "distant" and "blue" and "bureau of orthography" as the distant-rotunda. 

To decide whether (item - a thing) must be touched: 
    if the item is the noun and the action requires a touchable noun, yes; 
    if the item is the second noun and the action requires a touchable second noun, yes; 
    no.

Instead of doing anything when the distant-rotunda must be touched: say "From here [you] can't reach." 

The description of the distant-rotunda is "It is brighter blue than the sky and soars many [if the player wears the Britishizing goggles]storeys[otherwise]stories[end if]."

Rule for listing exits when looking in Tall Street:
	if Pinata Celebration is happening:
		do nothing instead;
	say "To the [south] is the important blue [rotunda] of the Bureau of Orthography. The street runs [west] towards the busy roundabout."

The employment office is a facade in Tall Street. It fronts north.  It is scenery.
	The description is "Only the stencilled lettering in the window identifies this place: Temporary Employment For Job Seekers. The blinds are down and the door locked. It doesn't look like a large facility." Understand "blinds" or "blind" or "door" or "window" or "lettering" as the employment office. 

Section 2 - Abandoned Park

The Abandoned Park is east of Tall Street. It is southern. "In contrast with the parks in the more savory parts of town, this is a bit of [patchy grass] where local dogs occasionally come out to do their business. A granite [war memorial] is fixed at the cen[ter][one of], which is why tourist maps optimistically call the place Monument Green. But the memorial is only moderately monumental and the grass hardly green at all[or][stopping]."
	Understand "monument" or "green" as the abandoned park.
	The introduction is "It is a place that might have been developed long ago; only it is known that there are remains of Roman settlement here, and there is a risk that digging out the foundations would turn up some of those ruins, exposing a large number of Latin-language objects to the light of day. To prevent this catastrophe the whole area has been placed off limits to development."

A war memorial is scenery in the Abandoned Park. Understand "granite" as the war memorial. The description is "It's a curious thing: it stands taller than a person and yet seems almost embarrassed and self-effacing. The lettering is cut quite small, and the names thereon are tightly spaced. Since 1829 there have been only thirty-five officially sanctioned surnames on the island, which means that, for reasons of space, the names have been truncated to numbers, and the result is a list that looks almost like a table of Biblical quotations: John 31, Mark 12, Paul 29.

The reason for all this compactness is that the memorial is dedicated to the dead of [i]all[/i] wars. Deaths from the War of Secession and the Civil Dispute of Standard[ization], losses from islanders volunteering in the French Foreign Legion, and the hefty cost of World Wars I and II, all are crammed into the upper left corner, leaving room for a long and bloody future."

A poppy is on the war memorial. Understand "flower" as poppy. The description is "Not a real, fresh poppy, but a construct of bright red fabric with a black heart." 

A description-concealing rule when the poppy is marked for listing:
	if the poppy is not seen and the poppy is not handled:
		now the poppy is not marked for listing.

Test poppy with "look / x memorial / look" in abandoned park.

The patchy grass is scenery in the Abandoned Park. Understand "dirt" or "ground" or "soil" as the patchy grass. The scent-description is "dusty ground". The patchy grass is diggable. The description of the patchy grass is "It's growing in dry flat tufts, from dusty earth."

Instead of digging in the patchy grass:
	if the dog is not seen:
		move the dog to the player;
		say "There does seem to be something metal just under the surface. A bit of scrabbling at the dirt is enough to excavate it: [a dog], made of metal, which might be almost any age.";
	otherwise:
		say "There's nothing else obviously close to the surface."

The description of the dog is "A small, heavy metal figurine representing a watchdog. He looks ferocious, on the verge of attacking. The teeth are especially savage." Understand "metal" or "small" or "heavy" or "figurine" or "watchdog" as the dog. The heft of the dog is 2.

Test dog with "tutorial off / dig / g / x dog / test dog-placing" in abandoned park.
Test dog-placing with "put dog on pedestal / get god / n / autoupgrade / wave z-remover at kudzu / look behind bushes / put god in shrine / look" in Roget Close.
	
A twig is a thing in Abandoned Park. "[one of][You] step on a [twig] before I back away again.[or]A [twig] lies in the grass.[stopping]". The description is "Nine or ten inches long, very thin and somewhat flexible. There are no leaves left on it."

Instead of propping a door with the twig:
	say "A nice thought, but the twig is too short and supple to make an effective prop. One needs something a bit longer." 

Rule for listing exits when looking in the Rotunda:
	do nothing instead.
	
The used furniture shop is a facade in Abandoned Park. It fronts east. The description is "Like just about everything else, the shop is closed, but were it open, it would be just the place to buy cracked mirrors, scuffed end tables, and wobbly chairs painted with a thick layer of off-white paint." It is scenery.

The veterinary clinic is a facade in Abandoned Park. It fronts north.  It is scenery.
	The description is "From outside it looks just the same as almost any kind of professional office: there could just as well be a doctor in there, or a lawyer, or a psychiatrist." 


	
Section 3 - Bus Station

The Bus Station is southeast of the Abandoned Park. It is southern. "A currently-desolate depot from which buses run seasonally to Maiana, the island's other major town. The [station building] is a low, rectilinear edifice from the 60s, all pebbled concrete and sheet glass, but it's shut, leaving accessible only a series of empty [bus bays] and a [wall-mounted schedule]. The public convenience to the [east] is the only thing open, while the area to the [northwest] is open parkland."

The old station building is scenery in the Bus Station. The description is "It's the most pathetic thing imaginable: the future, as imagined by the past. No one is in there at the moment." Understand "pebbled" and "concrete" and "sheet" and "glass" and "edifice" as the old station building.

The bus bays are scenery in the Bus Station. The description is "There are three bays, though it's rare for more than one to be in use at a time unless a chartered bus service is running on behalf of tourists or the schools."

The wall-mounted schedule is scenery in the Bus Station. The description is "The schedule is an intricate affair, and the de[if the player is wearing britishizing goggles]cy[otherwise]ci[end if]phering of the various letter-codes and footnotes was actually a subject of study in my grade school. The buses run every sixty-two minutes during daylight in the winter, every forty-three minutes in summer, with every third bus running as an express without stops if the passengers of this bus do not vote otherwise. 

During the run of the school year there is an extra inbound bus in the morning and outward in the afternoon; contrariwise the bus is on half-schedule Sundays and holidays, except major patriotic holidays when there is no bus at all.

Like today."

The shed is a thing in the Bus Station. "A [shed], rather ramshackle and unlikely, sits on the pavement, where it ought to be in the way of incoming buses." The heft of the shed is 10. The description of the shed is "Sheds like this are typically cheap and very very temporary housing for the homeless. The policy of the Bureau is that no one is allowed to beg, and punishments for begging and homelessness are often quite stiff, so there is nothing in the way of an established shelter on the island and little recourse for those who might need it."

Instead of opening or entering the shed:
	say "It's locked, but I doubt there's anything inside but possibly a few used blankets."

A dove is a bird in the Bus Station. "A [dove] flutters from one surface to another, occasionally stopping to stare at us." The heft of the dove is 2. Understand "bird" as dove. The description is "It is pure white, probably a refugee from a group released at a wedding. People do occasionally get married on Serial Comma Day."

The long-road is a facade in the Bus Station. The printed name is "long road". Understand "long" or "road" as the long-road. It is scenery. It fronts southeast. The description is "A long road leads through the outskirts of town south and east towards the rest of the island. It's an interesting journey, but not for today." 
	The closure notice is "That would be a long walk and in the wrong direction. ".
	
The convenience-exterior is a scenery facade in the Bus Station. The printed name is "public convenience". Understand "public" or "convenience" as the convenience-exterior. The description is "A humble structure."

Rule for listing exits while looking in Bus Station:
	do nothing instead.

Section 4 - Public Convenience

[The public convenience existed from a fairly early stage of the game development, as a place to change your wig or look in the mirror or acquire some soap. The dead-drop puzzle was a late addition to the game, and it came about because I felt that I wanted to make the espionage aspects more convincingly espionage-y. I used this excuse to read a couple of LeCarré novels — research, you see — and then extracted the concepts that I thought would be easiest to transfer into the context of IF.]

The Public Convenience is east of Bus Station. It is indoors and southern. The Public Convenience is a public restroom. The description of Public Convenience is "There are just the two toilet stalls[if at least two sinks are in the location] and a couple of [sink-collectives], but the place has been kept up reasonably well, if one doesn't count the [random graffiti][otherwise if one sink is in the location] and a single [random sink], the other one having been vandalized. The [random graffiti] adds a grim touch[otherwise] though both sinks are gone and there is [random graffiti] on the walls[end if]."

The introduction of the Public Convenience is "A faint smell of lavender lingers in the air."

Some sink-collectives are scenery in the public convenience. The sink-collectives are privately-named. The printed name is "sinks".  Understand "sinks" as sink-collectives.

Sanity-check doing something other than examining to the sink-collectives:
	if the number of sinks in the location is 0:
		say "[You][']ve already gotten rid of all the sinks to be found in this area." instead;
	let target be a random sink in the location;
	change the noun to the target. 

[After going to Public Convenience:
	let N be the number of entries in the path so far of the player;
	if N is greater than 1: 
		say "[path-walked so far]";
	otherwise:
		clear the path-walked for the player;
	[if hurrying:
		say "[line break]";]
	say "I double-take before remembering to go into the women's side; it's a good thing you're nudging me along.";
	continue the action.]
	
A soap is a fluid thing. The indefinite article is "some". The description is "Clear fluid for washing up with."
	The scent-description is "herbes de Provence".

Does the player mean waving the letter-remover at the soap:
	it is very likely.

The soap dispenser is a closed container in the Public Convenience. It is privately-named. Understand "dispenser" or "soap dispenser" as the soap dispenser. Understand "soap" as the soap dispenser when the soap is not visible. It is fixed in place. The initial appearance of the soap dispenser is "A [soap dispenser] hangs beside the mirror." The description of the soap dispenser is "It's the kind where a squeeze will dispense new soap into the sink[if the soap is not in the soap dispenser]. It is also empty[end if]."

Does the player mean waving the letter-remover at the soap dispenser:
	it is very unlikely.
	
Sanity-check taking the soap when the soap is in the soap dispenser:
	try squeezing the soap dispenser instead.

Instead of squeezing the soap dispenser:
	if soap is in the dispenser:
		if the number of sinks in the location is greater than 0:
			let target be a random sink;
			if a visible sink contains an open container (called receptor):
				now target is the receptor;
			otherwise:
				now target is a random sink in the location;
			say "[You] give the dispenser a squeeze and it deposits some soap in [the target][if the target is a sink] [--] just viscous enough not to drain away instantly[end if].";
			move the soap to the target;
		otherwise:
			say "[You] give the dispenser a squeeze and it deposits some soap on the floor, the sink having been removed from the area.";
			move the soap to the location; 
	otherwise:
		say "This time nothing much comes out."

The soap is in the soap dispenser. 
 

The wall-hole is a fixed in place container in the Public Convenience. Understand "hole" or "hole in the wall" or "hole in wall" or "wall" as the wall-hole. The printed name is "[if looking]hole[otherwise]hole in the wall[end if]". "About knee-height in one of the stalls is a [wall-hole] that runs right through the wall between the men's and women's restrooms." The description of the wall-hole is "It's too small to get a good look through, really, and usually cluttered with junk."

Report searching the wall-hole when the ash is in the wall-hole:
	say "[one of]At first there doesn't seem to be anything in there, but when we put our finger in, we find it's full of ash[or]The ash is still mounded up in the hole[stopping]." instead.

A description-concealing rule:
	if the ash is marked for listing and the ash is in the wall-hole:
		now the ash is not marked for listing.

The introduction is "It's here that you and Brock and Slango usually leave things for one another."

The ash is a fluid thing in the wall-hole. The description is "It's fine grey-white powder, and a fair quantity of it: too much to have come from a cigarette or two." The indefinite article is "some".
	The scent-description of the ash is "bitter smokiness". 

Instead of touching the ash:
	say "It leaves white-grey smears on our fingers."

Test ash with "tutorial off / open tub / get ash / smell ash / touch ash / put gel on ash / x card / wave t-remover at trash / wave r-remover at rash / x ash / gel ash / x trash" in the Public Convenience holding the tub.
	
Section 5 - Rotunda

The Rotunda is south of Tall Street. It is indoors and southern. "Echoing space, marble floor, eye-like [skylight] many me[ter]s above us: so far, the Rotunda might belong to any 19th-century government bureau of means and self-importance. 

What sets this one apart is the lettering, each sigil no bigger than a flea, carved over every inch of the walls. Inscribed here is, in fact, the [italic type]entire[roman type] [inscribed-text] of A New Orthodox Orthography[if the Rotunda is unvisited], which means that if [you] had a great deal of patience and many rolls of butcher paper, [you] could take rubbings and wind up with our very own volume.

[You] don't, of course. There are better things to do. More important places to go[end if]. The administrative part of the bureau is away to the south, and there is an exhibit of letter tools to the east, which is open to the public."

Instead of facing up in the Rotunda: try examining the inscribed-text.

The skylight is scenery in the rotunda. The description is "It is distant and perfectly round."

The inscribed-text is scenery in the Rotunda. Understand "new" or "orthodox" or "orthography" or "inscribed" or "text" or "lettering" or "inscription" as the inscribed-text. The printed name is "text". The description of the inscribed-text is "It is far too small to read, especially since the letters are not painted or inked, just carved into the stone surfaces." Instead of touching the inscribed-text: say "The letters are cool and tiny under our fingers." 

The informational bulletin-board is fixed in place in the Rotunda. Understand "bulletin" or "board" as the bulletin-board.  "Near the street entrance is a sizable [bulletin-board] advertising the services of the Bureau[if the bin is in the location]; and next to this, pushed back to be out of the way, is a [bin][end if]. [run paragraph on]"
	
The description is "[i]What Can Your Bureau of Orthography Do For You?[/i] inquires the bulletin board, in a sprightly casual font.
	
On a sheet labeled [i]From Plumbing to Medicine... 'And More'[/i], the bulletin board describes the tools available to the All-Purpose Officers, including a synthes[ize]r for combining two word-objects into one; Q- and Z-inserters (most letters are still under development); and even specially licensed equipment capable of producing living creatures. 
	
For immigration and importation services, such as assigning Atlantean names to immigrants, neutral[izing] foreign-language pets, and approving imported goods, [you] are encouraged to visit the Customs House instead."

After examining the informational bulletin-board:
	say "A handwritten note is tacked up after this, which adds that the synthes[ize]r is unavailable for public use through Dec. 19th because it is on loan to the university Department of Language Studies[if Samuel Johnson Hall is not visited][one of]. Hey, that's my department![or].[stopping][otherwise].[end if]"

A bin is a container in the Rotunda. It contains a shuttle. The description of the bin is "BUREAU PARKING, reads the bin, in thick black marker. DO NOT TAKE UNLESS AUTHOR[IZE]D."

The description of the shuttle is "It's a wooden device that holds a quantity of yarn, allowing the user more easily to pass the thread back and forth while weaving. 

It is also a bit of a snarky joke on the Bureau's part. Atlantean land prices being what they are, the Bureau prefers not to have to build a parking garage. Instead they have shuttles that an All-Purpose Officer with a homonym paddle can easily convert into a full-sized vehicle for use, and back again for easy storage.

The shuttles in their untransformed state are no earthly use to anyone else, of course, which is why they can be left around unsupervised."


Section 6 - Tools Exhibit

The Tools Exhibit is east of the Rotunda. It is indoors and southern.

The description of the Tools Exhibit is "This area, though technically part of the Bureau, is open to the public as a display of the tools (past and present) of orthographical dominance. Everything is, alas, behind glass. Over at one end of the room is a Regency version of your own letter-remover [--] known as the [Model T], because that is all it was originally able to remove. 

Next to that there is [an anagramming gun] and [an etymological reversing chamber]." The printed name of the Tools Exhibit is "Tools and Techniques Exhibit".

The display case is a scenery container. It is in the Exhibit. It is transparent, openable, and closed. Understand "glass" as the display case.

Instead of opening the display case:
	say "[one of]I don't want to sound like I doubt your criminal credentials, or whatever, but I doubt even you can successfully steal from this display case[or]No. Sorry, I just don't see how it could possibly work without our getting caught[or]Still not interested[stopping]. The casing material would stop a bullet.".
	
A description-concealing rule when the location is Tools Exhibit:
	now the display-platform is not marked for listing.

The display-platform is a supporter in the display case. Understand "pedestal" or "platform" as the display-platform. The printed name is "display platform".


Instead of shooting the display-platform with the loaded anagramming gun:
	say "The display platform shatters and starts to reassemble as [one of]a soft drippy llama[or]fatally dim props[or]dim floppy altars[or]papa's moldy flirt[or]forty pallid amps[or]a tipsy mallard fop[at random], but the containment control fails at the last minute and it goes back to being itself. Must just be too big an object for the gun to handle."

The Model T is a thing on the display-platform. The description is "The Regency-era T-remover is clumsy-looking and too big to lift, thanks to the coal boiler required to power it. It still bears the maker's mark of one S. Meretzky." The heft of the Model T is 12. Understand "coal" or "boiler" as the Model T.

Instead of taking the model T:
	say "It is much too large to lift."

Instead of switching on the Model T:
	say "It doesn't switch. It requires coal and water and a lot of patience, and [you] don't have a long supply of any of those things. Besides, it would only do 1/26th of what the ordinary letter remover can do."



The Etymological Reversing Chamber is a closed openable container on the display-platform. The heft of the Etymological Reversing Chamber is 12. The description is "It looks like an iron lung [--] a large sealed chamber with extensive machinery surrounding it. It is able to make words run back to their linguistic roots: ape into apa, pearl to perle, and so on. 

The machine is of little popular use and is principally applied by scholars under controlled circumstances." 
	The introduction is "Despite newspaper articles breathlessly proclaiming that the ERC will be able to produce the 'God language' [--] mankind's original tongue [--] in practice even the more modest research goal of rediscovering the vocabulary of proto-Indo-European would require prohibitive amounts of power. As one moves further and further from forms that are familiar to modern speakers, the reification effort required increases exponentially."

Report opening the Etymological Reversing Chamber for the first time:
	say "There is an exhalation of funereal dust, as though you had cracked an Egyptian tomb." instead.
	
Instead of switching on the Etymological Reversing Chamber:
	say "It is not plugged in, nor is there any plausible way to plug it in around here. Just as well: it probably draws a lot of power."

A description-concealing rule when the location is the Tools Exhibit:
	now the Model T is not marked for listing;
	now the Britishizing goggles are not marked for listing;
	now the anagramming gun is not marked for listing;
	now the Etymological Reversing Chamber is not marked for listing.

Sanity-check going to a privately-controlled room in Official grounds:
	if Cold Storage is visited:
		make no decision;
	[if the player encloses a visible bureau-disallowed thing:
		say "If [you] [are] going to try to get into the Bureau, [you][']ll need a pass and a reason for entry, and [you] should probably hide most of our possessions[if the player carries something bureau-allowed]. It's fine to have [the list of bureau-allowed things enclosed by the player], and our[otherwise]Our[end if] hair and clothing probably won't be closely searched, but anything illegal or weird, or anything an authentication scope would identify as fake, like [the list of visible bureau-disallowed things enclosed by the player], will need to be smuggled inside something else." instead; ]
	if a fake person (called ringer) is in the location:
		say "[The ringer] would probably give us away if [it-they] followed us. Best take care of that first." instead;
	continue the action. 
	
Section 7 - Antechamber

The Antechamber is south of the Rotunda. It is indoors and southern. "The most important task of any government bureau is to keep away time-wasters, irritants, and uninformed members of the general public, who might distract the diligent workers within from their important tasks. The Bureau of Orthography is no different.

An [instructive notice] details the criteria for entry to the Bureau proper."

The instructive notice is scenery in the Antechamber. The description is "Please note that those wishing to enter must have a PASS suitable for visitors, which must include an UP TO DATE photograph closely resembling the subject. Passes that do not look like their possessors will be rejected. 

Visitors will also need an additional proof of their business in the Bureau, such as a letter of invitation from a Bureau authority.

All credentials will be subject to inspection with an authentication scope. 

Anyone attempting to enter the Bureau with a falsified pass or lack of proper credentials may be subject to FINES and INDEFINITE DETENTION."

A tall stool is in the Antechamber. The description of the stool is "It looks uncomfortable."

Instead of waving the letter-remover at something in the presence of the secretary:
	say "Not with the secretary watching, [you] don't."

The secretary is a police woman on the tall stool. The description of the secretary is "Curiously, she refuses to quite meet our eye."

Understand "woman" or "guard" as the secretary. [The secretary carries an Authentication Scope.] She wears a pencil skirt and a plain white top. Understand "shirt" or "blouse" as the top.

The description of the pencil skirt is "A prim, pencil-length number reaching to just below the knee. It is the regulation shade of Orthographical Blue."

The description of the plain white top is "Devoid of ruffles, lace or other distractions."

[Originally the secretary could be solved in a variety of different ways. Initially she was dressed in a skirt and blouse, both of which could be letter-removed to make other objects, so that she'd be embarrassed by her sudden denuding and run out of the room. That solution didn't last very long at all, though, since about two seconds of thought suggested it was both mean-spirited and creepy.]

Rule for writing a paragraph about the secretary when the location of the cad is the location:
	say "[The secretary] sits on [a stool], fidgeting with [if a random chance of one in two succeeds]the hem of [the skirt][otherwise]the neckline of [the plain white top][end if], and glaring at [the cad]. ".

Rule for writing a topic sentence about the secretary:
	say "Here to guard access to the rest of the building is [a secretary][if the secretary is on the tall stool] [in-on a tall stool][end if].[no line break] [run paragraph on]".

[Every turn when the secretary carries the skit:
	say "[The secretary] screeches in horror at her newly defrocked state, and leaps from [the stool], dropping [the list of things carried by the ]. She runs from the room.

The skit [--] which turns out to be performed by a harmless-looking man wearing a tea-towel on his head [--] turns to us and says, 'Oh dear!' 

The man departs after her.";

	remove the secretary from play;
	remove the skit from play. ]
	
Instead of someone going to a room which is not the Rotunda in the presence of the secretary when the person asked does not enclose the pass:

'The invitation doesn't state a particular time,' we say.

She deflates momentarily and goes back to inspecting. 'There's another problem. This invitation is for Professor Waterstone. They're watermarked individually to avoid fraud. You're not Professor Waterstone.'

'He sent me to do some research in his place. I'm a student of his.'

She frowns. 'Invitations to inspect highly secure machinery are not transferrable,' she says. 'And how should I know whether you stole it?'";

Instead of waiting during Attempting Entry:
	say "Sure, hang in there. I'm pretty sure that what [you] need here is to act as much like Professor Waterstone himself as humanly possible."
	
Every turn during attempting entry:
	if time since Attempting Entry began is 1 minute:
		say "'Professor Waterstone is a busy man,' I say. 'If you want me to tell him you wouldn't cooperate, I'm just as happy not to work on Serial Comma Day. But if DCL wants his endorsement or advice, they'll have to work within his schedule. If you are going to turn me away, however, I would like the opportunity to speak with your manager.'

The secretary scowls. 'Fine. I'll contact Waterstone.' She places a call [--] on speakerphone, no less [--] glaring all the time.

'Waterstone here,' says the phone. There's background traffic noise. Waterstone must be on the road already. Figures he would have a car phone. Most people aren't allowed, here.

'I have a student here attempting to use your invitation to enter the Bureau,' says the secretary. 'Was it stolen?'

'What? Oh that. No.'

'You're saying you gave your invitation away.'

'Yes I did,' says Waterstone. 'And I have been a research partner to DCL since before you were born.'

'Sir, you are aware that this is highly irregular!'"; 

Attempting  entry ends when the time since Attempting entry began is three minutes. 

When attempting entry ends: 
	say "The secretary is still talking. 'You personally vouch for this student? You know her well and are sure of her trustworthiness?'

'Known her for years,' lies Waterstone, annoyed. There's a click as he hangs up.

'What a delightful man,' remarks the secretary. 

She looks over our other visible possessions ([the list of things carried by the player]) and deems them acceptable. She makes us sign a book, for which [you] use a signature of your invention. Finally: 'Go in, descend to the basement, and present yourself at the secure section downstairs. Be advised you will be under video surveillance as you approach. Any attempts to modify or steal Bureau property, to gain access to rooms to which you have not been expressly invited, to eavesdrop on conversations of Bureau employees, or to leave objects of your own behind in the Bureau, may result in your arrest and prosecution.

[Persuasion rule for asking the secretary to try looking at something through something: 
	persuasion succeeds. ]

Understand "bribe [secretary]" as a mistake ("Attempts to bribe bureau employees carry sentences of up to ten years in prison. I'm not up for that, thanks.").

Instead of taking something which is enclosed by the secretary:

Section 8 - Hallway and Inaccessible Room

The Bureau Hallway is east of the Antechamber. It is indoors and southern. "This is a long hallway with many doors leading off, the business of the bureau being varied and all-encompassing; it is for all essential purposes the chief organ of government in Atlantis, since only a few topics are brought to citizen referendum."



The All-Purpose Office is east of Bureau Hallway. It is indoors and southern.  "There's a front desk at which a receptionist meets with members of the public and assesses their needs; beyond that, the room is crowded with dozens of stations for the use of the All-Purpose Officers, and stretches back some distance. It looks like an old-fashioned newsroom.

Fully half the stations are empty, due to their owners being away on call somewhere on the island, but the rest are fully occupied [--] many of them by people who wear authentication monocles routinely."

Every turn when the location is the All-purpose office:
	say "I'm pretty sure that hanging out here is the best way to get caught in a hurry, though, so let's duck back out, shall we? Maybe one of the other rooms will offer us better prospects.";
	try going west.
	

Chapter 2 - Bureau Basement

Section 1 - Foot of Stairs

Below Bureau Hallway is Bureau Basement South. Bureau Basement South is indoors, forbidden and southern. The description of Bureau Basement South is "[You] have descended into a windowless underground passage. The hallway runs [north] from here, and for an eerily long way [--] the tunnels must extend well beyond the above-ground profile of the building."

Rule for writing a paragraph about the plywood cutout when the seer automaton is mentionable and the location is Bureau Basement South:
	say "Propped in the corner are some articles that were probably meant to be used as part of the Serial Comma Day Fair, but got confiscated instead: [a seer automaton] and [a plywood cutout] depicting Atlantida.".

A push-button device is a kind of device.

Sanity-check switching off a push-button device:
	say "[The noun] [one of]only runs for a little while at a time, and is already off[or]has already shut down again[at random]." instead.

The seer automaton is a push-button device in Bureau Basement South. Understand "robot head" as the seer automaton. The heft is 3. The description is "It's a robotic head inside a glass box. When turned on, it gives out fortunes. There's an old-fashioned carnival feel about the thing, and the fact that it's a portable size makes it a good candidate for traveling fairs."
	
Instead of switching on the seer automaton:
	say "The seer cranks to life, looks us up and down with painted wooden eyeballs, and in a tinny voice, says, 'I predict [one of]you will become BIG. Much bigger than you were yesterday[or]you will escape.' Asthmatic whirring. 'Possibly on the back of an interstellar whale[or]the Bureau won't last past tomorrow[cycling].'"
	
The plywood cutout is a fixed in place thing in Bureau Basement South. "A plywood cutout depicting Atlantida is propped in the corner." Understand "painted" or "depicting" or "atlantida" or "hole" or "head" or "funny pose" as the plywood cutout. The heft is 5. The description is "It's one of those plywood cutouts where a tourist sticks his head through and someone else takes a photo showing the tourist a funny pose. This one puts the tourist's face on Atlantida, complete with flowing blue robes and expansive bosom."

Understand "put [something] through [something]" as inserting it into.

Sanity-check inserting something into the plywood cutout:
	if the noun is the player:
		try poking head through the plywood cutout instead;
	say "[The noun] would not balance inside the face cutout." instead.

Understand "put my/our/your head in/into/through [something]" as poking head through. 
Understand "put head in/into/through [something]" as poking head through.

Poking head through is an action applying to one thing.

Sanity-check an actor poking head through something which is not the plywood cutout:
	if the noun is wearable:
		try the actor wearing the noun instead;
	otherwise if the noun is a door:
		try the actor entering the noun instead;
	otherwise:
		if the player is the actor:
			say "I'm not sure that's feasible.";
		stop the action.
		
Report someone poking head through the plywood cutout:
	say "[The actor] look[s] frankly awesome with [its-their] head poking through above the bosom and flowing robes of Atlantida." instead.

Report poking head through the plywood cutout:
	say "[You] momentarily enjoy the sensation of being cast as Atlantida, spirit of the island, invincible, implacable, the sum of the devotions and desires of all our people.
	
It's a giddy feeling. No wonder the Bureau confiscated this thing and wouldn't let it be shown at the fair." instead.

Section 2 - Basement Middle

North of Bureau Basement South is Bureau Basement Middle. It is indoors, forbidden and southern.
The description of Bureau Basement Middle is "The hallway continues both [north] and [south], flanked by doors painted immutable col[our]s: hyacinth, celadon, chartreuse."

The hyacinth door, the celadon door, and the chartreuse door are scenery in Bureau Basement Middle. 

Rule for listing exits while looking in Bureau Basement Middle:
	do nothing instead.

The description of the hyacinth door is "A small plaque on the door reads 'Internal Security.' [door-quip for the item described]."

The description of the celadon door is "A small plaque on the door reads 'Liaison to Homeland Business Interests.' [door-quip for the item described]."

The description of the chartreuse door is "A small plaque on the door reads 'Overseer of Business Abroad.' [door-quip for the item described]."

To say door-quip for (N - a thing):
	say "[one of][The N] is impervious even to N-insertion, should someone develop it[or]I don't even recogn[ize] the kind of lock on this thing[at random]".
	
The cute security door is a locked lockable door. "The [cute security door] at the [if the location is Bureau Basement Middle]north[otherwise]south[end if] end is solidly shut[if Cold Dilemma has happened]; there's no sign of anyone still waiting on this side of it[end if]." It is north of Bureau Basement Middle and south of Bureau Basement Secret Section. The description is "A thick iron door, decorated with Hello Kitty stickers. There is no handle and no access to the locking mechanism (though it is certainly locked). The door can only be activated by guards in another room, watching through a video camera."

[Here I compromised narrative plausibility in order to make the game winnable. It seems highly unlikely to me that anyone would be allowed to visit this area without an escort of guards. However, the multiplication of doors, and the trick of the guard controlling a second door by watching for it through a video camera, are based on memories and stories about the facility where my mother did some classified work back in the 80s.]

The adorable video camera is a thing in Bureau Basement Middle. "[An adorable video camera] hangs in the left corner above the door." It is fixed in place. The description is "It has a lens, certainly, but it is also made of pink plastic and has cat ears. And it looks like it will recognize us if we approach, perhaps?"

A ranking rule for the adorable video camera:
	decrease the description-rank of the adorable video camera by 100.


[handles approach camera, go to camera, etc]
Sanity-check finding the video camera:
	try entering the cute security door instead.
	

Instead of waving to the video camera:
	say "[You] raise a hand and wave to the camera. Its ears swivel in acknowledgement.";
	try entering the cute security door.
	
Sanity-check going through the cute security door when cold dilemma has happened:
	say "That way will be guarded. If [you] [are] going to escape, it will have to be by some back way." instead.

Before going through the cute security door:
	let N be the number of entries in the path so far of the player;
	if N is greater than 1: 
		say "[path-walked so far]";
		say "[You] come to a cutely decorated security door. ";
	otherwise:
		clear the path-walked for the player;
	say "The guards have apparently been instructed to allow us in, because as [you] approach, the door slides open.";
	now the cute security door is open.

After going through the cute security door:
	now the cute security door is closed;
	say "The door seals behind us as soon as [you] [are] through.";
	continue the action.

Some Hello Kitty stickers are part of the cute security door. The description is "They're here to ensure that this door is unlike any other door, and will not respond well even to advanced custom-language devices."

Section 3 - Secret Section
	
Bureau Basement Secret Section is indoors, forbidden and southern. "The heightened security on this side of the door is obvious everywhere [you] look. The floor is tiled in paisley tiles. The light fixtures give off pale pink light. The walls are covered in frog leather. The doors are locked with padlocks the size of handbags, locks decorated à la Louis Quinze, combination locks made of solid gold. There is not a bare noun in sight."

Some frog leather walls, paisley tile floors, enormous padlocks, fancy locks, and gold combination locks are scenery in the Bureau Basement Secret Section. The description of the frog leather walls is "Mostly green spotted with brown, but for decorative trim they've used more exotic tree frogs in blue and orange."

The description of the paisley tile floors is "[You] have a dizzying impression of walking on an old gentleman's tie."

The description of the enormous padlocks is "Huge and heavy, like something out of the jail in a child's cartoon."

The description of the gold combination locks is "They may look old fashioned, but inside I daresay they are electronic and use one of those systems where the passcode is tied to the exact current time of day."

The description of the fancy locks is "They look as though they were doing service in Versailles, but they also look as though they're really fingerprint readers. The business of grasping the lock to insert the key is the important thing. Not that [you] have the right sort of fingertips for that."

Rule for listing exits while looking in Bureau Basement Secret Section:
	say "[if Cold Storage is visited]Going south through the security door isn't an option; our only way out is north[otherwise]The hallway runs from south (comparatively normal) to north (deeply frightening)[end if]. Just west is the equipment testing room[if Cold Storage is visited], and southwest is Cold Storage[end if]." instead.

Section 4 - Testing Room

The Sensitive Equipment Testing Room is west of Bureau Basement Secret Section. It is indoors, forbidden and southern. "A room with no windows, no cameras, no recording equipment, and barely any furniture." The Sensitive Equipment Testing Room contains a rock.

The initial appearance of the rock is "A [rock] sits in one corner of the room."

Before going from the Sensitive Equipment Testing Room:
	if the player does not know brock-found:
		say "[You] shouldn't leave here until [you] have some clue about what happened to Brock when he came in." instead;
	if the rock is enclosed by the location and the rock is not enclosed by the player:
		if Brock does not recollect getting-out-now:
			say "[You] can't leave rock-Brock. That was the whole point of coming down here, right? The whole point of risking our freedom and all that extra time. So let's gel him." instead;
		otherwise:
			say "We can hardly leave Brock here." instead;
	if Brock is in the location:
		say "Brock is determined that we get the T-inserter tested before we leave, and it's probably faster to cooperate with him than to fight it out." instead.
		

Carry out putting gel on the rock when the player does not know brock-found:
	now the player knows brock-found; 
	complete "Find Brock";
		
[Instead of putting gel on the rock when the player is in Sensitive Equipment Testing Room:
	if the player knows brock-found:
		say "No, don't gel him! Think. How would [you] smuggle him out? Only one of us came in. He's much more portable in rock form.";
	otherwise: 
		complete "Find Brock";
		assign "Return to yacht" at Sunning Deck;
		say "[brock-found]You're right, that must be Brock. (B-removed himself when he heard someone coming down the corridor, maybe?) But bringing him back now is a terrible idea. How would [you] smuggle him out? Only one of us came in. He's much more portable in rock form." ]
		
Instead of putting gel on the rock when cold dilemma has ended and Sunning Deck is not visited:
	say "Having two people to smuggle back to the yacht will just make this trip twice as hard to accomplish."
	

After printing the name of Brock while looking at the rock through the monocle:
	complete "Find Brock";
	say "[brock-found]";

[Sanity-check going from the Sensitive Equipment Testing Room:  
	if Restroom Trouble has happened:
		continue the action;
	if the player encloses a visible bureau-disallowed thing:
		say "[You] came in with just a handful of things (apparently, anyhow), and [you] shouldn't be caught with lots of extras now. It would lead to explanations[if the player carries something bureau-allowed]. It's fine to have [the list of bureau-allowed things enclosed by the player], and our[otherwise]Our[end if] hair and clothing probably won't be closely searched, but [the list of visible bureau-disallowed things enclosed by the player] should probably be concealed." instead;

Section 5 - Cold Storage


Cold Storage is southwest of Bureau Basement Secret Section. It is indoors, forbidden and southern. "Shelves on both sides of the room are full of [objects-on-stands] on stands: objects that used to be men and women, and in a few cases even children. The [stand labels] preserve their original names."

The introduction is "If this goes wrong, we could wind up living in here permanently. So we'd better figure whom to send out, and do it fast."

Some assorted shelves are scenery in cold storage. The description is "There's room for more contents, to be sure."

The duty roster is fixed in place in Cold Storage. "[A duty roster] is posted prominently." The description is "The roster records duty shifts once every two weeks, assigned to various people in the department, all of them very high-ranking. 

'Be conscientious,' admonishes the roster. 'Read each name clearly while looking at the item through a monocle. If you suspect an object of losing its original identity, contact the Curator. We have disposed of seventeen objects this year!!'"

The objects-on-stands are scenery in Cold Storage. The printed name is "objects". Understand "thing" or "things" or "objects" or "object" or "stand" or "stands" or "on" or "jon" or "alice" or "peter" or "lucy" or "19" or "13" or "20" or "2" or "1" as the objects-on-stands. The description is "The stand labels preserve their names, and a few details such as birthdate and date of inanimation."

Some stand labels are part of the objects-on-stands. The description is "[You] pick out a name on one of them: [one of]Graham 1, born 1968, inanim 2005[or]Jon 19, born 1979, inanim 1999 on charge of attempted espionage[or]Alice 13, born 1950, inanim 1982 on charge of stealing DCL information[or]Peter 20, born 2000, inanim 2010 on charge of reckless use of constructed language[or]Lucy 2, born 1991, inanim 2009 on charge of smuggling French materials[or]Thierry Claude, foreigner, inanim 1969 on charge of espionage[or]Petra Odinsova, foreigner, inanim 1972 on charge of not speaking English[at random]."

Instead of putting gel on the objects-on-stands:
	if the patsy-woman is in the repository:
		say "Hang on [--] are you sure you want to send one of these poor bastards out there? It would be cruel to get their hopes up just to have them re-arrested, not to mention that it would make my father look like a fool if he arrested a dissident who turned out to have been in storage all along. >>" ;
		if the player consents:
			move the patsy-woman to the location;
			say "[line break]We gel the nearest of the objects, and it comes to life: a woman in her thirties or forties, at first so motionless that she looks like a statue, until she remembers that she can move.";
		otherwise:
			say "[line break]Okay then. There might be some other way.";
	otherwise:
		say "Choosing the nearest thing to us, [you] apply a little restoration gel. Nothing happens, though. It seems this particular object has forgotten what it used to be."
		
Instead of looking at the objects-on-stands through the monocle: 
	if the patsy-woman is in the repository: 
		say "The nearest of the objects resolves, awkwardly, into the face of a woman. It's hard to tell much about her, her age or her dress, from the faded image the monocle creates.";
	otherwise:
		say "There is only a shapeless shadow: the memory of something this object used to be, but now is not."

Test storage1 with "placefather / tutorial off / open tub / out / gel rock / z" holding the rock and the tub and the monocle in Cold Storage.
Test storage2 with "placefather / tutorial off / open tub / out / x objects / gel object / z" holding the rock and the tub and the monocle in Cold Storage.
Test storage-bug with "placefather / tutorial off / open tub / out / x objects / gel object" holding the dove and the rock and the tub and the monocle in Cold Storage.

Rule for listing exits while looking in Cold Storage:
	do nothing instead.

Cold Dilemma is a scene. Cold Dilemma begins when the location is Cold Storage.

Instead of going from the Cold Storage when Cold Dilemma is happening:
	say "So you want us both to get caught? Well, I'm not up for that arrangement. What [you] [are] doing here is important. I say [you] send Brock and get out of here."
	

Every turn when Cold Dilemma is happening and the time since Cold Dilemma began is 1 minute and father is in a room:
	say "I vote [you] gel Brock and send him out to my father. No, hear me out. Brock's cover is probably not in great shape anyway. You might be able to rescue him later. And it would be a coup for my father to have a real big arrest to put on the record."

Definition: a person is human if it is not an animal.

Every turn when Cold Dilemma is happening and the player can see someone human (called the victim) who is not the player: 
	if victim is Brock:
		say "You're silent. I'm not letting you act again. You're not stopping me. 

'We're still inside the Bureau basement,' I say. 'We just need to head out, separately.'
	
He looks puzzled. 'Aren't we safer together?'
	
'No,' I say.[paragraph break]";
		say "[command prompt]";
		wait for any key;
		say "[paragraph break]'But[--]'[paragraph break]'Look, just trust me, this once,' we say.[paragraph break][The victim] back[s] out the door. Loud sounds of an arrest ensue. I hear my father's voice, and two other people. Then finally the sounds die away.";
		remove Brock from play;

I keep thinking: my father is going to look like a fool when it's found he's arrested a fake person; he'll be disgraced. 

I want to stop you, but you've got the upper hand now[or][stopping].

[The victim] back[s] out the door.

[end if][one of]There's a noise like the firing of a restoration gel rifle and [or]The rifle fires again, followed by[stopping] the sound of [the victim] collapsing into [a list of things which proffer the victim]. 'Nice try,' shouts a voice from outside. 'Next?'";

'No general reprieve,' you say. 'Just you.'

This isn't what I want. It's not just unfair; it's actually monstrous. 'What were you put in for?' I ask.

'Italian,' she whispers.

'What?'

'I was learning Italian,' she says. 'I wanted to read Manzoni. There was no sympathy from the officers; they thought it was an inexplicable desire. Is it daylight or night-time out there? Not that it matters. I haven't seen either in so long.'

You gesture at the door. She looks at us once more, doubtfully, and goes.

From the corridor comes the sound of a shot being fired from a restoration gel rifle; the woman exclaiming in pain; officers gathering around her for the arrest. And she'll be back here, I suppose, before the night is out. I suppose that allows you to tell yourself that it wasn't a bad thing, what we just did.";


Cold Dilemma ends when father is not in Bureau Basement Secret Section. 

When Cold Dilemma ends:
   	change the library message grammatical number to singular;
	say "A faint spell comes over [if library message person is second person]you[otherwise]me[end if] and [you] feel dizzy.";  

Instead of examining the player when the library message grammatical number is singular:
	if the library message person is second person:
		say "It's still our joint body, but it feels like you, and I'm riding along, somehow. Part of you, but alienated. Something's wrong. I want to get out.";
	otherwise:
		say "I can feel you in my head, but you've... stilled, sort of. Like an animal that's given up. Like a dog hiding in the corner of a cage. I feel more like me than I have all day, though I miss my real body.";
	rule succeeds.
	
Instead of putting the restoration gel on yourself when Cold Dilemma is happening:
	say "[one of]If you have some idea of gelling me and sending me out there while you escape with Brock, let me tell you, I know enough to ruin you. I know Lena, I know Slango, I know who to talk to at the Counterfeit Monkey. I know half a dozen other exploits you pulled before. And I would tell them, because that's the only way I'd get to avoid a full trial for treason. I like you, honestly, but if it's you or me, I'm still picking me[or][You] already discussed this. I'm not going out there[stopping]. Unless you're volunteering to go yourself? >>";
	if the player consents:

We do the split, a cold hasty slathering of gel, and--

[i]You're on your own now. You give Alex one last look. Wonder how he's going to get away, shivering and naked as he is, but that's not your problem now. He can keep all of your stuff, and doubtless there's some kind of outfit to be found in there. You go.

After that comes interrogation, incarceration, a trial that's remarkably swift. You aren't asked about whether you'd like to plea bargain. Alex's father doesn't mean to let you say the half of what you know; not if it would endanger him and his son. You spend most of the time leading up to your trial in a fog so dense that it must be drugs. You can barely speak.

The sentence is inanimation. You are put on the chair and the last thing you notice is the executioner setting the dial of his letter-remover to C.[/i]";
		end the story saying "For a long long time you know nothing at all";

		say "I didn't think so."; 
		
Instead of listening to Cold Storage when Cold Dilemma is happening:
	say "The men waiting outside aren't loud, but they're not silent, either. There's a sound of movement here and there."

Instead of listening to cold storage when Cold Dilemma has happened and Cold Dilemma has ended:
	say "All quiet out there now."

 
		
Book 5 - Act V Atlantida Herself

Part 1 - In the Depths of the Bureau

[This is where we've been headed all game long: into the secrets of the Bureau, which is absurd, chaotic, and obscenely powerful.]

Chapter 1 - Storage and Secrets
	
Section 1 - Display Reloading Room

[ The Display Reloading Room is meant to deliver the anagramming gun to the eager player (after some earlier hints that we'd never get our hands on it). It also provides a kind of link back to the world of normal people even though the PC has now wandered into a situation where she is isolated and beyond help. The television shows the reactions of the ordinary security guards and tourists upstairs, who have a very different relationship to the items on display than the player does.

At the same time, we want to discourage the player from thinking that there is something to be won by trying to communicate with those back upstairs. So while the tourists are shown to have reactions to certain types of item, they remain on a tight cycle and can't be broken out of their basic behavior.]
	
Display Reloading Room is south of Equipment Archive. It is indoors, forbidden and southern. "This area [if the display-platform is not in the location]is more or less empty. [Hazard-tape] marks off an area of the floor to indicate that [you] shouldn't stand there[otherwise]is mostly taken up with the [display-platform] descended from the room above[end if]."

A tv monitor is a fixed in place device in the Display Reloading Room. It is switched on. Understand "black" or "white" or "black and white" or "television" or "security" as the tv monitor. "A black and white [tv monitor] is embedded in the wall."

Rule for writing a topic sentence about the tv monitor:
	say "[initial appearance of tv monitor] [description of the tv monitor] [run paragraph on]".

Instead of switching off the tv monitor:
	say "There's no switch."
	
Instead of listening to the tv monitor:
	say "There is no sound pickup."

Instead of examining the tv monitor:
	say tv description;
	say paragraph break.
	
Definition: a thing is display-foreign:
	if it is the etymological reversing chamber:
		no;
	if it is the anagramming gun:
		no;
	if it is the model t:
		no;
	yes.
	
To say tv description:
	say "[one of]It is showing images of the Tools Exhibit upstairs, one of the few parts of the Bureau open to the public[or][You] have another look at what is going on up in the Tools Exhibit[stopping]. ";
	if the display-platform is in the display case: 
		say "[one of][tourist-face][or]A small child is gawking at [the random thing on the display-platform][or]The room appears to be temporarily empty of guests[or][fake-incident][cycling].[no line break]";
	otherwise:
		say "[one of]Some tourists are frowning at the blacked-out display case[or]One of the tourists upstairs taps the blacked-out display case in irritation[or]The tourists are gathered in an angry cluster, pointing at a guidebook and waving their arms at each other[or]A security guard strolls into the room. The tourists round on him and wave their arms. Their mouths are moving and they point vehemently at the display[or]The security guard is holding his hands up placatingly[or]The largest and heftiest of the tourists is leaning forward and yelling at the security guard[or]The largest and heftiest of the tourists is in the midst of being arrested[or]The tourists are all gone and the room is empty, with only the blacked out case visible[stopping].[no line break]";

To say fake-incident:
	if a display-foreign thing is on the display-platform:
		say "[one of]The security guard on his rounds notices [the list of display-foreign things on the display-platform]. He gets out a pad of paper as though to write up an incident report, but makes a gesture that even through closed circuit recording reads plainly as Inability To Be Bothered, and strolls away again[or]The security guard from before enters the room, looks at his watch, and heartily ignores [the list of display-foreign things on the display-platform][or]This time when a security guard comes into the room, it's a different one from previously. He goes over to the display case and frowns at [the list of display-foreign things on the display-platform]. Then he talks to someone on his radio[or]Two security guards enter the room and look into the display case. They appear to be having a vehement argument about what to do[or]Two security guards are talking to a manager about the situation in the display case[or]A manager is taking notes about the display-case disturbance[or]Some All-Purpose Officers are taking depositions and someone is photographing [the list of display-foreign things on the display-platform][stopping]";
	otherwise:
		say "[one of]A security guard pokes his head into the room, decides all is well, and strolls away again[or]The security guard returns for another pass through the area[or][You] get another view of the security guard's balding head as he takes a turn around the room[or]The security guard is in the middle of checking the place out again[stopping]". 

To say tourist-face:
	if a display-foreign thing (called distraction) is on the display-platform:
		if the distraction is naughty-sounding:
			say "A family notices [the distraction] and the mother covers her daughter's eyes, frog-marching them both out. The father is left behind to gawk in peace";
		otherwise if the distraction is illegal:
			say "A female couple come in, notice [the distraction], and hold a short whispered conversation. They then turn and look at the security camera, look at each other, and walk briskly out again";
		otherwise if the distraction is an animal:
			say "A small boy taps on the glass, trying to get the attention of [the distraction]";
		otherwise if the distraction is edible:
			say "A little girl presses her face to the glass near [the distraction] and then [--] this is clearly visible from the camera [--] [i]licks the glass[/i]. Rather startled parents call her away";
		otherwise:
			say "Tourists are looking at [the distraction] in some confusion";
	otherwise:
		say "[Random-passerby] is gazing curiously at [the random thing on the display-platform]";

A hazard-tape is scenery in the Display Reloading Room. The description is "It's striped yellow and red, and describes an area on the floor. Come to that, there's an area in the ceiling immediately above the hazard tape that looks separate from the rest of the ceiling." The indefinite article of the hazard-tape is "some". The printed name of the hazard-tape is "[if looking]Hazard[otherwise]hazard[end if] tape". Understand "hazard tape" as the hazard-tape. Understand "tape" as the hazard-tape when the tape is not visible.

A small black push-button is fixed in place in the Display Reloading Room. "There is [an item described] on the wall." Understand "button" or "push button" as the push-button. The description is "It is unlabeled."

Does the player mean pushing the small black push-button:
	it is very likely.

Instead of pushing the small black push-button:
	if the display-platform is in the location:
		if an essential thing (called essential item) is on the display-platform:
			say "Best not to part with [the list of essential things on the display-platform]." instead;
		raise the display;
	otherwise:
		lower the display.

To lower the display:
	say "A heavy clunk sounds. On the [tv monitor], [you] see the display case black out.
	
Then there is a groaning of moving metal, and part of the ceiling lowers. [one of]This is, apparently, how displays are swapped out for the tools exhibit upstairs: the [display-platform] is lowering to our level, providing access[or]The [display-platform] descends again until level with the floor[stopping][if something is on the display-platform]. This brings [the list of things on the display-platform] down into the room[end if].";
	now the display-platform is in the location.
	
To raise the display:
	say "There is a groaning of gears and hydraulics, and the [display-platform][if something is on the display-platform], loaded with [the list of things on the display-platform],[end if] rises back up to the exhibit level.";
	now the display-platform is in the display case.
	
Test television with "tutorial off / x television / x tv / g / g / g / g / g / g / g / press button / watch tv / g / g / g / g / g / g / g / put armband on platform / press button / watch tv / g / g / g / g / g / g / press button / get armband / put cock on platform / press button / x tv / g / g / g / g / g / g / g / press button / get cock / put dove on platform / press button / x tv / g / g / g / g / g / g / press button / put cate on platform / get dove / press button / x tv / g / g / g / g / g / g / g / g" in the Display Reloading Room holding the armband and the cock and the cate and the dove.
	
[It turned out to be possible to divest yourself of the anagramming gun (and thus be unprepared to face Atlantida) by returning it upstairs on the display platform. So we now check that nothing essential is on the platform before allowing it to rise.]

Test gun-taking with "tutorial off / press button / g / g / get gun / press button / g / put gun on platform / press button" in the Display Reloading Room.


Section 2 - Wonderland

	 
Wonderland is north of Bureau Basement Secret Section. It is indoors, forbidden and southern. The description is "The [ridiculous décor] continues, now so extreme that I cannot even put a name to the things around us. They might as well be extrusions from a nightmare by Dali, or by Dr. Seuss. Offices are accessed by hatchways that seem to have come from submarines, or through passages resembling the sphincter of a great whale, or up ladders decorated with human teeth. 

An open archway leads to storage space east of here."

The odor is a fixed in place thing in Wonderland. The printed name is "od[our]". "Hanging in the air at the north end of the hallway is an [odor]." Understand "odour" as the odor.

Instead of examining the odor:
	try smelling the odor.

Sanity-check doing something when the action requires a touchable noun and the noun is the odor:
	if the current action is the action of smelling the odor:
		make no decision;
	say "[You] can't actually touch [the odor], seeing as it is, in fact, just a vapor in the air, a dispersion of molecules dispersed through the rest of the local atmosphere." instead.

Sanity-check doing something when the action requires a touchable second noun and the second noun is the odor:
	try touching the odor instead.

Instead of smelling the odor:
	say "I can't quite place it. There's definitely a smell, but what is it [i]like[/i]? Strawberries? Burning rubber? Freshly chopped chives? Every time I think I've pinned it, it goes again, sliding sideways to smell like something else."

Instead of smelling Wonderland when the odor is in Wonderland:
	try smelling the odor.

Rule for listing exits while looking in Wonderland:
	do nothing instead.

Equipment Archive is east of Wonderland.

The ridiculous décor is scenery in Wonderland. Understand "hatchways" or "submarines" or "passages" or "sphincter" or "passage" or "hatch" or "hatchway" or "ladder" or "ladders" or "teeth" or "human" or "tooth" or "offices" or "whale" or "great" as the ridiculous décor. The description is "The name plaques identify such functions as 'North-End Meeting Room' and 'DCL Special Liaison,' but who knows whether the descriptions are remotely true. There is something very menacing about it all, as though one were going mad."

Instead of climbing the ridiculous décor:
	say "None of the passages are open."
	
Instead of entering the ridiculous décor:
	say "None of the passages are open."

Rule for distantly describing Wonderland:
	say "The hallway gets considerably stranger in that direction: you've only seen such places in movies. Or nightmares."
	
Report shooting the odor with the anagramming gun:
	say "The gun fires into the odor, which disperses. There's ripple in the air, and in its place [a detritus] appear[s][if the detritus is not seen]. [run paragraph on][detritus description][end if]." instead.
	
Rule for printing the name of the odor while shooting the odor with the anagramming gun:
	say "odor".
	
Rule for printing the name of the odor while waving the letter-remover at the odor:
	say "odor".

	
Section 3 - Equipment Archive
	
Equipment Archive is a room. It is indoors, forbidden and southern. "The ceiling is mirrored, perhaps to make it harder for anyone to sneak around without being noticed among the shelves."

A ceiling mirror is a mirror in the Equipment Archive.

Instead of shooting a mirror with the loaded anagramming gun:
	record "Finn Rosehip award for gnu-hunting" as an achievement;
	say "[You] fire the anagramming gun into [the noun]. The reflection at once converts the anagramming gun into an anagramming gnu.
	
The gnu stares around in confusion, its watery gaze temporarily dissolving everything it looks at, until at last it happens to catch its own reflection.

A moment later, the anagramming gun is merely a gun again."

Some equipment shelves are a supporter in Equipment Archive. "[The shelves] here display an assortment of obsolete, broken, foreign, or otherwise unusual letter tools. "

On the shelves are an accent flipper, an umlaut punch, a Catalan punt volat needle, some broken components, and some lamb-granulates.


Test flipperbug with "tutorial off / autoupgrade / open tub / gel lamb granulates / load gun with bullets / shoot flipper / shoot cap" holding the anagramming gun and the tub in the Equipment Archive.

The description of the lamb-granulates is "They're tiny brown beads used to make lamb-stock gravy. Perhaps they're left-over military rations of some kind." The printed name of the lamb-granulates is "lamb granulates". Understand "lamb granulates" or "gravy" or "lamb" or "lamb granulates" as the lamb-granulates.

The description of the accent flipper is "Not an Atlantean product at all, but a machine built by the state-subsid[ize]d French company Aigu. Its sole purpose is to convert accents or remove them entirely, not a function that much applies to English words. In form, it looks like a very small spatula connected by wire to a substantial battery pack." The heft of the accent flipper is 5.
	The introduction of the accent flipper is "You've heard of the congrès / congres scandal. One of these was responsible."  
	
Test flipper with "look" in the Equipment Archive.

The description of the broken components is "A heap of parts from old machines: cranks, gears, buttons with letters and numbers on them, delicate hoops of silver wire, knobs from which all the markers have worn away." Understand "parts" or "heap" or "old machines" or "cranks" or "gears" or "buttons" or "delicate" or "hoops" or "silver" or "wire" or "knobs" or "crank" or "gear" or "button" or "hoop" as the broken components.

Instead of facing up in Equipment Archive:
	say "The whole ceiling is mirrored. [run paragraph on]";
	try examining the ceiling mirror.
	
Rule for listing exits while looking in Equipment Archive:
	say "The functional area continues to the south, and the hallway is west."
  

Chapter 2 - Through the ODOR DOOR

Section 1 - Oracle Project
	
The Oracle Project is a room [north of Wonderland]. It is indoors and forbidden. "This is nothing less than the command cen[ter] for a massive propaganda campaign. [Paintings] of Atlantida and [polling charts] cover the walls, dating back to the second world war and continuing straight through to the present."

Rule for printing the name of the paintings while looking:
	say "Paintings".

The Oracle Project contains a long table. The long table is scenery. On the long table is a paperweight. The description of the paperweight is "Blue and white strands are swirled through the heavy, lens-like hunk of clear glass."

Index map with the Oracle Project mapped north of Wonderland.

Some polling charts are scenery in Oracle Project. The description is "Blue lines on the charts record the citizen responses to the concept of Atlantida. They record wartime progress in establishing the concept in the popular imagination, with a spike in 1942, corresponding to a heavy press of propaganda. 

After the war, there's a break in the charts until 1951, when tracking resumes. Additional spikes appear at 1968 and 1972.

Each chart also shows a yellow line, which roughly goes down as the blue line goes up. It is labeled 'Power to generate animate abstract.' The yellow line stops at 1982 and no further points are recorded on it."

The inciting fable is on the long table. The description is "It's a short children's tale, with illustrations. A young boy was left an orphan in a certain village. So he went door to door around the village, but none of the families would take him in, all having some excuse: there were too many children already, the house was too small, there was not enough food, the parents were too old for a new child, and so on.[paragraph break]Despondent, the boy was on the verge of giving up when a magician came to town. He went around door to door with the boy a second time, this time asking each household for just one letter. When he was done, he used a powerful machine on the letters in his bag, and transformed them into a LOVING FAMILY![paragraph break](The text ends here, but the illustration shows the boy beaming in the arms of a manufactured mother, father, siblings, hamster, and goldfish.)"

Some paintings are scenery in Oracle Project. The description is "The paintings are old, 19th-century affairs, and they show Atlantida larger than life, typically wearing blue, with a sort of French academy face and bare feet. The squid is a frequent motif in the background, as it represents inventiveness, strength, and the ability to try many things at once."


		
Section 2 - Surveillance Room 

[The surveillance room looks both forward and back in the story. It shows us a little of what's to come, and also lets us see what's happened to some of the characters from earlier on, providing something of a summary of recent events.  

Design-wise, we need to be careful here. On the one hand, we want to extend a bit the time between the player realizing that Atlantida exists and his encounter with her; and build up a sense of menace around her. At the same time, there's a risk of diluting things *too* much or giving the player too many things to read and research, as opposed to things to do and manipulate.

The surveillance room description is intentionally kept very brief as a partial balance to this: there's not much to see because we're going to be focused on the computer screen, which contains lots of information.]

The Surveillance Room is east of the Oracle Project. It is indoors.

The surveillance computer is a desktop computer in the Surveillance Room. It is fixed in place.  "A [surveillance computer] is mounted on the wall, an impressive flat screen readout[if the surveillance computer is switched on] displaying current activity[otherwise] presently blacked out[end if]." The surveillance computer is switched on.
	The description of the surveillance computer is "Below the flat screen are a keyboard and mouse, both shiny silver. Only top of the line equipment down here, it seems."

Understand "flat" or "screen" or "readout" as the surveillance computer's screen. The description of the surveillance computer's screen is "It is bigger than my parent's television, and that is saying something."

[Here we nab something straight out of the Computers documentation: a computer with a multiple-choice operating system and a range of subprograms. 

The sense we want to convey here is the sense of being the spider at the center of the web: the person using this computer has access to a huge range of information, a view of the whole Bureau and parts of the city.]

The surveillance computer runs a multiple-choice program called PCOS. PCOS is privately-named. The options table of PCOS is the Table of GUI Options.
		The software priority of PCOS is 1.

Table of GUI Options
topic	title	effect
"security/cameras/surveillance/camera/program" or "security cameras"	"Security Cameras"	open-security rule
"power/grid" or "power grid"	"Power Grid"	power-grid rule
"requisitions"	"Requisitions"	requisitions rule 
"access/records/record" or "access record/records"	"Access Records"	access rule

This is the access rule:
	say "This selection brings up on screen a database of 'Accesses.' Still visible for today's date is a record labeled Inquiry on Civic Unrest.";
	repeat with item running through software run by the surveillance computer:
		now the software priority of item is 5; 
	now the software priority of access-database is 1;
	try examining access-database.

This is the requisitions rule:
	say "The screen brings up what appears to be a system for requisitioning and supply for this area. The recent entries are diverse and in some cases cryptic:

[fixed letter spacing] 34224 eBook order at request of Subject A details attached[line break]
34223 toys and diversions order at request of Subject A, children's jacks, balls, puzzles, games[line break]
34222 espresso beans for Subject A - previous order unacceptable see attached[line break]
34221 bakery requisition[line break]
34220 coffee beans resupply for Subject A[line break]
34219 berg resupply to boiler - previous supply melted - NB new supply is required even if not used[line break]
34218 rifle resupply for handlers for Subject A, new gel required as safety measure[variable letter spacing]

...and so on, scrolling back and back and back."	

This is the power-grid rule:
	say "The screen flashes up a schematic of the entire Bureau [--] the public rooms we're familiar with, the basement, and the special section we're in now. It appears that three different power supplies feed these, one for the public areas and one, more heavily backed up, for most of the basement. Both of these are running.
	
A third power supply is located east of here, and [if the boiler is switched off]is currently shut down, leaving the eastern rooms dark[otherwise]is lit up like a Christmas tree with the tremendous amounts of power it's channeling[end if]."

This is the open-security rule:
	repeat with item running through software run by the surveillance computer:
		now the software priority of item is 5; 
	now the software priority of security-program is 1;
	say "[You] select the surveillance program. It brings up a menu of possible camera views. [run paragraph on]";
	try examining security-program. 
	
Understand "search [text]" or "search for [text]" as typing it on when the player can see a computer which runs a search engine.

This is the customs rule:
	say "The screen shows the interior of the customs house, now barely populated thanks to the late hour. The camera is focused on the poster of wartime Atlantida. It looks perfectly ordinary and has suffered no defacement."

This is the statue rule:
	say "The view shifts to a shot at the Roundabout, with its Atlantida statue, taken apparently from some building across the road. The crowd from earlier is long gone, and there's no obvious sign of vandalism."

This is the storage rule:
	say "The screen shows the interior of the Cold Storage room. Nothing is moving in there."

This is the front rule:
	say "The screen shows the rotunda. [one of]One tourist is heading towards the front door[or]A security guard makes a slow round[or]A family of tourists passes through[or]A young blond man, probably about 20, stands looking up at the Rotunda surface, his lips moving[cycling]."

This is the interrogation rule:
	say "[one of]The screen shifts to displaying interrogation room A. [Higgate-behavior][or]The screen shifts to interrogation room B. [teen-behavior][or]The screen shifts to interrogation room C. [Brock-behavior][or]The screen shifts to interrogation room D. [stored-behavior][cycling].";

To say Higgate-behavior:
	say "[one of]Professor Higgate is standing next to a metal table. She is wearing her shirt, but for some reason her lower half is stripped to the underwear. She is speaking urgently to someone who is not shown[or]Professor Higgate is shaking her head at someone she is talking to[or]Professor Higgate is slumped over a metal table, motionless[or]A hand reaches across the screen and presents Higgate with a plastic cup of coffee.

	otherwise:
		say "The camera shifts to show a bit of cliff overlooking the water. There's a window cut into the cliff face [--] that must be the exit in question[one of]. Is that a hint of movement behind the window? It's hard to be sure[or]. 
	
As we watch, a pale face appears at the window, too quickly to study, and then vanishes again[or][stopping]."

This is the static rule:
	say "Nothing shows but a steady field of static."

This is the tunnel-display rule:
	say "The camera shifts to show a dimly lit corridor cut through sedimentary rock[if Tunnel is visited][--] just below here, in fact[end if][if something portable is in the Tunnel]. [You] can make out [a list of portable things in the Tunnel][end if]."
 
Software can be quittable. A software is usually not quittable. Security-program is quittable. Access-database is quittable.

A first input handling rule for quittable software (called chosen software):
	let N be indexed text;
	let N be the topic understood;
	if N is "main":
		reset to operating system;
		say "[You] return to the operating system.";
		try examining PCOS;
		rule succeeds. 
	
Carry out switching off the surveillance computer:
	reset to operating system.
	
To reset to operating system:
	repeat with item running through software run by the surveillance computer:
		now the software priority of item is 5; 
	now the software priority of PCOS is 1;
		
After examining a quittable software (called chosen software):
	say "[You] can also select MAIN to return to the operating system." 

Rule for listing exits when looking in Surveillance room:
	say "[if Workshop is visited]The Workshop[otherwise]Another room[end if] lies to the east. The door [you] came through is west, and there is also a spiral staircase down[if tunnel is visited] to the tunnel[end if]."
 
The spiral staircase is a down-staircase in Surveillance Room. "A [spiral staircase] descends into a hole in the corner of the room, into what looks like a tunnel through natural rock."


Section 3 - Workshop

Workshop is east of Surveillance Room. Workshop is indoors and forbidden. "A room whose importance is obvious from how clean it is and how little furniture it is allowed to have."



[Rule for listing exits while looking in the Workshop:
	say "The Oracle Project is west and [if the Generator Room is unvisited]someplace even more industrial lies to the east[otherwise]the Generator Room east[end if]. A spiral staircase leads down into a dimmer place." ]

	
Section 4 - Generator Room

[This whole puzzle is a late-in-design addition. Originally the player went through the ODOR/DOOR and ran into Atlantida directly. But beta-testers felt that the process of getting to Atlantida was too easy and rapid, with insufficient build-up; there wasn't enough time to create apprehension. They also felt that the Bureau sequence was too linear. So we open things out a bit with a couple of puzzles that can be solved simultaneously: installing the power cord and getting the boiler working could happen in either order.

The imagery for this area is intentionally a bit first-person-shooterish, though I was thinking more Portal 2 than Half-Life. ]

The Generator Room is east of the Workshop. It is indoors and forbidden. "The walls are lined with concrete. [Yellow paint lettering] says CAUTION: HIGH ENERGY EQUIPMENT and DO NOT OPERATE WITHOUT TRAINING."

The concrete-lining is scenery in the Generator Room. The printed name is "concrete lining". Understand "concrete" or "lining" or "walls" or "wall" as the concrete-lining. The description is "It's untreated grey concrete."

The yellow paint lettering is scenery in the Generator Room. "CAUTION: HIGH ENERGY EQUIPMENT, it says. DO NOT OPERATE WITHOUT TRAINING. There is also a stenciled letter A surrounded by atom-style rings." Understand "stenciled" or "letter" or "letter a" or "atom-style" or "rings" or "ring" or "atom" as the yellow paint lettering.
	The printed name is "[if looking]Yellow[otherwise]yellow[end if] paint lettering".

The first aid station is in the Generator Room. "[A first aid station] is built onto the wall[if the first aid station is open] and hangs open[otherwise]. It is closed[end if]." The first aid station is an openable closed container. The description of the first aid station is "It's a large box mounted to the wall, with a red cross painted on the front of it." Understand "large" or "box" or "red" or "cross" as the first aid station.
 
A ranking rule when the first aid station is mentionable:
	increase the description-rank of the first aid station by 10.

In the first aid station is a balm. The indefinite article of the balm is "some". The description of the balm is "According to the label, it is designed to relieve the pain of severe burns."
 

Instead of waving the letter-remover at the balm when the current setting of the letter-remover is "b":
	say "For a moment, just a moment, the balm starts to turn into an old-fashioned coin representing the concept of 'alm'; then it flickers out again uncertainly. Probably because 'alms' is not really a plural form and 'alm' is unattested in practice."


The boiler is a device in the Generator Room. It is fixed in place. "Most of the room is taken up with a gigantic boiler installation[if the boiler is switched on] periodically giving off flashes of light and steam[otherwise] that is currently off[end if]. The locking mechanism is [a cryptolock][if something is in the cryptolock], currently containing [a list of things in the cryptolock][otherwise], currently empty[end if]." It is switched off. 

The description is "This frighteningly massive contraption has pipes and compression tanks and steam gauges and dents and rust stains[if switched on]. It trembles a little. The needles of the gauges twitch, but stay out of the red[otherwise]. All the gauge needles point to 0[end if]. A thick glass pane allows a view of one of the first chambers." 

Understand "rust stains" or "stains" or "gauges" or "steam" or "power" or "generator" or "boilers" or "compression tanks" or "pipe" or "pipes" or "needles" or "large pipe" or "water" as the boiler.

Every turn when the location contains the switched on boiler:
	if the remainder after dividing turn count by 3 is 0:
		say "[one of]Light flashes[or]White light flashes[or]There's a particularly vibrant blue-white flash[or]There's a flash of light[or]Ice flashes into steam[or]A loud pfft! sounds[at random] [one of]within[or]inside[or]from within[or]in[at random] the boiler[one of] and[or] and all[or]. All[at random] the [one of]meters twitch[or]meter needles flicker into the red[or]steam gauge needles jump[at random][if a random chance of 1 in 3 succeeds] violently[end if]."

Instead of touching the boiler:
	if the boiler is switched on:
		say "The metal pipes are warm to the touch, and in a few places hot enough to scald.";
	otherwise:
		say "The pipes are mostly warm, except one running into the chamber which feels cool."
		
The thick-glass-pane is part of the boiler. Understand "thick" or "glass" or "pane" as the thick-glass-pane. The printed name is "thick glass pane". 


Instead of examining the thick-glass-pane:
	try searching the thick-glass-pane.

Instead of searching the thick-glass-pane:
	if the boiler is switched off:
		say "Water lies stagnant inside a large pipe, and a metal rod points down towards the water.";
	otherwise:
		say "Water flows steadily through a large pipe. Floating on the surface of the water are bergs of ice; before they melt entirely, a zap from a b-remover converts them to ergs. Each time this happens, there is a flash of light and steam, and the pane of glass becomes temporarily too fogged up to see through. The steam gauge needles jump.

Gradually the passage of the water cools the pane down again."

Check an actor switching on the boiler:
	if the actor is not the player:
		stop the action;
	if the boiler is switched on:
		say "The boiler is already in operation." instead;
	otherwise:
		say "There is no obvious switch. They most likely keep this thing locked." instead.



Section 5 - Tunnel through Chalk

The Tunnel through Chalk is below Surveillance Room.  Tunnel through Chalk is indoors  and forbidden. "This passage has been cut through natural cliff rock and looks older than the Bureau itself. The walls are rough-hewn, exposing [sedimentary strata]. Here and there it looks as though someone has actually excavated a fav[our]ed rock or relic."

The sedimentary strata are scenery in the Tunnel through Chalk. The description is "Layers of slightly varying chalk col[our], some of which are embedded with tiny seashells and other fossil evidence." Understand "layers" or "chalk" or "seashells" or "tiny" or "shells" or "evidence" or "fossil evidence" as the sedimentary strata.

Every turn when the location is Tunnel through Chalk:
	if a random chance of 1 in 3 succeeds:
		say "[one of]The air stirs with a breeze from the east[or]A breeze along the passage stirs the dust[or]There's a faint tang of salt air[or]Something like the cry of a seagull comes down the passage[as decreasingly likely outcomes]."
		
Instead of smelling Tunnel through Chalk:
	say "The air does smell fresher here."

The upward-spiral staircase is an up-staircase in Tunnel through Chalk. The printed name of the upward-spiral staircase is "spiral staircase". Understand "spiral" as the upward-spiral staircase.

Understand "raise [portcullis]" or "lift [portcullis]" as opening.

The portcullis is a door. It is east of Tunnel through Chalk and west of Personal Apartment. "[if the location is Tunnel through Chalk]Blocking the far end of the corridor is a metal [portcullis][otherwise]The metal [portcullis] guards the way back[end if]. [portcullis status]."
	The description of the portcullis is "Heavy black metal bars, left from a much earlier state. [portcullis status]."

To say portcullis status:
	say "It is currently [if the portcullis is open]raised[otherwise]lowered[end if][if the jack wedges the portcullis] a few feet by [a jack][end if][if something is on the pulley]. From the pulley above the portcullis hangs [a list of things which are on the pulley][otherwise]. There's a pulley and hook arrangement above the portcullis, but the hook is empty[end if]".
	
Instead of searching the portcullis:
	if the player is in Tunnel through Chalk:
		say "Thanks to the angle of the tunnel, it's hard to see much of the room beyond, save that the rough rock walls have been paneled, and [you] can make out the edge of a desk or table, probably an old one. There's some source of natural light through there.";
	otherwise:
		say "The pulley mechanism is clearly visible but is on the far side of the bars."

The pulley is part of the portcullis. It is a supporter. Understand "rope" or "pulley" or "hook" as the pulley. The description of the pulley is "Rope runs from the top of the portcullis over pulleys and down to a hook. It looks like a contrivance to help open the portcullis."


Check putting the weight on the pulley:
	say "This weight isn't substantial enough, and also provides no loop or ring that would let it hang from the hook." instead.

Check putting an unhookable thing on the pulley: 
	say "[The noun] do[es]n't fit on the hook." instead.
	
Definition: a thing is unhookable:
	if it is the counterweight:
		no;
	if it is the ordinary-counter:
		no;
	if it is floppy:
		no;
	yes.
			
[And to account for cases where you make an unhookable thing on the pulley via letter-manipulating something that was previously there:]

Every turn when something unhookable is on the pulley (this is the portcullis empty rule):
	if the player can see the pulley:
		say "[The list of unhookable things on the pulley] fall[s] to the ground.";
	now every unhookable thing on the pulley is in Tunnel through Chalk.
	
Sanity-check putting something on the portcullis:
	try putting the noun on the pulley instead.

Check putting something on the pulley when something is on the pulley:
	say "The hook can only really hold one thing at a time. [run paragraph on]";
	while something (called the current content) is on the pulley:
		try taking the current content;
		if the current content is on the pulley:
			stop the action.

Every turn when the counterweight is not on the pulley and the portcullis is open (this is the portcullis fall rule):
	unless something wedges the portcullis:
		now the portcullis is closed;
		if the player can see the portcullis:
			say "The portcullis crashes shut."
		
Check opening portcullis:
	if the counterweight is not on the pulley:
		say "[You] strain at the base of the gate, but the portcullis is much too heavy for us to lift unaided. We need some kind of mechanical advantage." instead.
		
Report putting something on the pulley:
	say "[You] hang [the noun] on the hook." instead.
	
Report putting the counterweight on the pulley:
	say "[You] hang [the noun] on the hook[if the portcullis is closed]. The portcullis shifts slightly but doesn't rise on its own. Perhaps with a little help, though[end if]." instead.
	
After putting the counterweight on the pulley when the jack wedges the portcullis:
	now the jack does not wedge the portcullis;
	say "[You] hang [the noun] on the hook, and the portcullis opens to its full extent, leaving the jack free."
	
Understand "use [jack] on [something]" as propping it with.

Check propping the portcullis with something which is not the jack:
	say "[The second noun] [is-are] not strong enough for such a heavy door." instead.

Sanity-check opening the portcullis when the player carries the jack:
	if the player is hurrying: 
		say "[path-walked so far]There [you] try propping the portcullis with the jack.[paragraph break]";
		clear path-walked for player;
		increase path description count by 1;
	try propping the portcullis with the jack instead.

Sanity-check unlocking the portcullis with the jack:
	try propping the portcullis with the jack instead.
	
Report propping the portcullis with the jack:
	say "[You] slip [the jack] under the portcullis and raise it a few feet [--] enough for us to slip past." instead.
	
After deciding the scope of the player when the location is Personal Apartment or the location is Tunnel through Chalk:
	if the portcullis is wedged by something (called the impediment):
		place the impediment in scope.
	
Instead of pulling the pulley when the counterweight is not on the pulley:
	if the portcullis is closed:
		say "Even pulling from above, [you] can't budge the portcullis. Some additional weight is required.";
	otherwise:
		say "The portcullis is already open and the counterweight nearly to the ground."
		
Instead of pulling something which is on the pulley:
	if the noun is the counterweight:
		try opening the portcullis;
	otherwise:
		try pulling the pulley.

[Nothing makes this explicit, but in addition to being part of the counterweight, the counter measures numbers of visits to the oracle in a given month. For the most part people do not open the portcullis and consult with Atlantida from the outside instead, as they are increasingly afraid of her.]

The ordinary-counter is on the pulley. The printed name of the ordinary-counter is "counter". The description of the ordinary-counter is "One of those devices with a press-button to increment a number, to assist with counting things like the number of people attending an event. There's also a loop to let the user wear it over one finger. The counter currently reads [counter-state]." The ordinary-counter has a number called the counter-state. The counter-state of the ordinary-counter is 17.

Understand "press-button" or "button" as the counter. Understand "counter" as the ordinary-counter. The ordinary-counter is wearable.

Instead of pushing the ordinary-counter:
	increase the counter-state of the ordinary-counter by 1;
	say "Click! The counter now reads [counter-state]."

	

 
	
Chapter 3 - Atlantida's Spaces

Section 1 - Personal Apartment
  

The Personal Apartment is a room. It is indoors and forbidden. "At a guess, this is a room hardly anyone ever visits, or even knows about. Though the ceiling and one wall are bare cave, the rest has been paneled and  graciously decorated in the style of the end of the 18th century. [if the oil-paintings are in the location][Oil-paintings] on the walls depict great men and women of Atlantis gone by: Phyllida Shaply, Amelia Landison, Clarence Arbot, Jon Rosehip. [end if]An antique bed stands in the cen[ter] of the room." 

atlantida-woman is an attackable  woman in the Personal Apartment. [She is on the fancy bed.] The printed name of atlantida-woman is "Atlantida". The description of atlantida-woman is "Her face is ageless, her eyes a piercing blue. She looks like Phyllida Shaply, our famous forebear, except that there is something ethereal and heroic about her as well." 

Rule for listing exits while looking in Personal Apartment:
	say "Air and sunlight stream in from the east."

The inlaid desk is a desk in Personal Apartment. The description is "Very elegant and delicate."

A stack of files is on the inlaid desk. The description is "Even a quick look through the titles gives some idea. 'DCL Plausibility studies on a syllable-removing gun.' 'Economic impact study towards an S-inserter, with particular attention to factory closures and workforce reduction in the developing world.' 'Single-noun Targeted Bomb.' 'Popular Opinion Study Concerning Utopian Linguistics.' 'Monthly Counterintelligence Report on Progress towards Manipulation of Simplified Chinese Character Set.' 

There are others like this, some thin, some fat with paperwork and sticky notes."

Instead of taking the stack of files:
	say "There are too many of them: they slide every which way."

Instead of searching the stack of files:
	say "They're full of alarming information, but there's no time now to memor[ize] everything."

A rubber stamp is a thing on the inlaid desk. The description is "It is made to stamp two words: ETHICAL VETO. The discol[our]ation shows it has indeed been used, though not, perhaps, very recently."

Understand "stamp [text]" as a mistake ("It seems unlikely that our tampering would go unnoticed.") when the player can see the rubber stamp.

The oil-paintings are scenery in Personal Apartment. They are plural-named. The printed name is "[if looking]Oil[otherwise]oil[end if] paintings". Understand "oil" or "painting" or "paintings" or "portraits" or "portrait" as the oil-paintings. The description is "They look like originals. I have seen some of these portraits before, in books at school or in the museum, but was given to understand that they'd been stolen, leaving only photographs or replicas."

A fancy bed is a clothed bed. It is scenery in Personal Apartment. The description of the fancy bed is "Draped in eau-de-Nil blankets, and tossed by a restless occupant." Understand "antique" as the fancy bed. The printed name of the fancy bed is "bed".

Understand "eau-de-Nil" or "eau" or "de" or "nil" as the fancy bed's blankets. The description of the fancy bed's blankets is "They're brocaded, worked with the great A of Anglophone Atlantis."

The description of the fancy bed's pillow is "Down, I'm sure."
The description of the fancy bed's sheets is "Pale and satiny, just a few shades lighter than the blankets."



[A bead is on the inlaid desk. The description of the bead is "It's a large, glass bead, beautifully patterned in blue and white and clear glass. But that does not explain its presence here." 

Before putting gel on the bead:
	if the bead is not in the location:
		if the player does not carry the bead:
			try taking the bead;
		if the player carries the bead:
			try dropping the bead.
	
Report dropping the bead:
	say "[You] set the bead down on the floor." instead.

Before waving the letter-remover at the fancy bed when Phyllida is on the fancy bed:
	say "She sees what [you] [are] up to.";
	try atlantida-woman exiting. ]
	
Section 2 - Private Solarium

The Private Solarium is east of Personal Apartment. It is indoors and forbidden. It contains a coffee table and a chaise longue. The description of the coffee table is "Antique as well, most likely. It is the same handsome wood as the furnishings in the rest of the apartment." 


Rule for listing exits when looking in the Private Solarium:
	do nothing instead.

The coffee table is scenery. On the coffee table is a silver tray. On the silver tray are some jacks, a cloth napkin, some crumbs, and a dirty coffee cup. The silver tray is not fixed in place.

The description of the jacks is "A set of children's playing jacks[if the jacks are not handled and the jacks are on the silver tray]. They are lined up, with curious precision, into the letter A[end if]."

Rule for writing a topic sentence about the silver tray when the silver tray is on the coffee table:
	say "Left on [a coffee table] (as though waiting for maid service) is [a silver tray]. [run paragraph on]"

The chaise longue is a chair. The description of the chaise longue is "It implies afternoons of elegant indolence. Many of them." It is scenery. On it is an ebook reader. 

The description of the silver tray is "Just matte enough to give no reflections, and stamped with a classical Atlantean pattern of overlapping olive branches and chard leaves."

The description of the cloth napkin is "Good linen in eau-de-nil, monogrammed with a large A, and smeared with a few smudges of honey." It is floppy and wearable. The heft of the cloth napkin is 1.

The description of the crumbs is "At a guess, they come from some sort of breakfast roll or pastry." The crumbs are edible. The heft of the crumbs is 1. Instead of taking the crumbs: say "[You] know they'll only make a mess."

The description of the coffee cup is "The residual liquid in the bottom reveals that the person whose breakfast this was takes a small amount of milk and no sugar." The coffee cup is a container. 

The description of the ebook reader is "An expensive recent model, silver-backed, with a glossy touch screen." The ebook reader is a computer. Book search is a search engine. The ebook runs book search. The data table of book search is the Table of Dull Data. Understand "list" or "list of books" as the ebook reader.

Understand "scroll [something]" as scrolling. Scrolling is an action applying to one thing. Check scrolling: say "I'm not sure how you can scroll [a noun]." instead.

Instead of scrolling the ebook reader:
	choose a random row in the Table of Dull Data;
	say "[You] scroll through a selection of [title entry]. [data entry][paragraph break]".

The description of Book search is "There is a long, scrolling list of books, with titles on economics, biography, linguistics, and history. A search bubble allows the user to search for specific genres or titles."

Table of Dull Data
topic	title	data
"history" or "wartime" or "operations" or "invention" or "atlantida" or "wartime operations" or "invention of atlantida" or "wartime operations and the invention of atlantida" or "Atlantis" or "mediterranean"	"history books" 	"The search finds some 72 titles, focused especially on Mediterranean cultures ancient and modern. The history of Atlantis, and the political history of the Bureau itself, are covered in a series of popular[izing] works. One book, 'Wartime Operations and the Invention of Atlantida,' has evidently been read through several times."
"linguistics" or "dcl" or "dental" or "consonants"	"linguistics books"	"The list is surprisingly thorough and even scholarly, showing a clear grasp of the major fields of linguistic manipulation theory. There are even a few PDFs of works that are not, to my knowledge, available to the public: they are private internal publications of Dental Consonants Limited. All in all, this would not be an unambitious reading list for a graduate student in a related field."
"biography" or "phyllida" or "shaply" or "marcus" or "aurelius" or "churchill" or "winston" or "margaret" or "thatcher" or "martin" or "luther" or "king" or "nelson" or "mandela"	"biographies"	"The collection includes four different biographies of Phyllida Shaply; numerous lives of her contemporaries; and then a bizarrely diverse coverage of saints and villains, ancient and recent figures. Marcus Aurelius appears, as do Winston Churchill and Margaret Thatcher, Martin Luther King and Nelson Mandela." 
"economy/economics/macroeconomics"	"books on the economy"	"Several impressive-looking textbooks on macroeconomics are listed, though from the bookmarks it is clear that the owner has not been able to get all the way through them."

The tall window is an attackable door. "A window in the north wall, cut out through the cliff face, gives a view of [if the current daytime is sunset]the ocean in fading sunlight[otherwise if the current daytime is evening]tranquil sea under a darkening sky[otherwise]brilliant sunlight and the hot sea[end if]."   It is north of Private Solarium and south of the Precarious Perch.

The description of the tall window is "[if the tall window is open]The window stands open.[else]The window is closed.[end if]".

After examining the tall window, try searching the tall window.

Instead of going south through the tall window when the tall window is locked:
	say "It's locked again. There's no way for us but forward from here."

Rule for writing a paragraph about the tall window when the location is the Precarious Perch:
	if the tall window is open:
		say "The window in the cliff face opens onto the solarium to the south.";
	otherwise:
		say "It's hard to see through the tall window to the room behind: mostly it reflects the sea."

Instead of searching the tall window:
	if the player is in Precarious Perch:
		if atlantida-refreshed is in Private Solarium:
			say "Atlantida waves to us, then turns back to deal with any approaching guards.";
			now atlantida-refreshed is in the personal apartment;
		else:
			say "The room is there, to be sure, but no one is coming just yet.";
	otherwise:
		say "Through the window, there's a beautiful view of the sea; but further inspection also reveals a narrow strip of grassy ledge, really only just wide enough to stand on, before a steep descent over stones."  
		
Check attacking the tall window with something:
	say "[The second noun] bounce[s] harmlessly off the window glass. It must be artificially strengthened or something." instead.

Instead of climbing the tall window:
	try entering the tall window. 

Instead of going through the closed tall window:
	say "The window is shut: you'd break the glass."
	

Official Grounds is a region. The Antechamber, Rotunda, Tools Exhibit, All-Purpose Office, Bureau Hallway, Bureau Basement South, Bureau Basement Middle, Bureau Basement Secret Section, Wonderland, and Sensitive Equipment Testing Room, Equipment Archive, Cold Storage,  Display Reloading Room, Workshop, Generator Room, Surveillance Room, and Oracle Project are in the Official Grounds.
	
The Antechamber, All-Purpose Office, Bureau Hallway, Bureau Basement South, Bureau Basement Middle, Bureau Basement Secret Section [, Wonderland, Display Reloading Room, Oracle Project, Workshop, Equipment Archive, and Cold Storage] are privately-controlled.

Report facing in Official Grounds when the location is Wonderland or the location is Basement Secret Section:
	if the noun is up or the noun is down:
		say "There are no obvious exits that way." instead;
	say "None of the doors in that direction look useful to us, and some of them look frightening." instead.




Part 2 - Final Departure

Chapter 1 - The Seaside

The distant-sea-view is a distant backdrop. It is fluid. It is in Customs Hallway, Precarious Perch, Old City Walls, Old Hexagonal Turret, and Crumbling Wall Face. The printed name is "view of the sea". Understand "view of the sea" as the distant-sea-view. It screens north, northwest, and northeast. Understand "ocean" or "sea" or "waves" or "water" or "horizon" as the distant-sea-view. The description is "The water is quiet today [--] though it rarely achieves very impressive waves anyhow. The col[our] ranges from a bright Bureau blue close to shore to a deep lapis at the horizon."

The sea-view is a backdrop. It is fluid. It is in Abandoned Shore, Private Beach, and Open Sea. It screens north, northwest, and northeast. The printed name is "sea". Understand "view of the sea" as the sea-view. Understand "ocean" or "sea" or "waves" or "water" or "horizon" as the sea-view. The description is "[if the location is Open Sea]The seawater is pleasantly clear here: there's little turbulence to stir up muck, little seaweed.[otherwise if the location is nautical]The surface of the water glitters in the last light.[otherwise]The waves are low and gentle, little more than a wash of foam over the surface of the beach, like an emptied dishpan.[end if]".

Instead of listening to the sea-view:
	say "There's a gentle lapping of waves."

Instead of listening to a room in the presence of the sea-view:
	try listening to the sea-view.

Instead of washing something in the presence of the sea-view:
	say "Washing things in ocean water tends to leave them a bit gritty afterward, or even stained with rings of dried salt."

Instead of tasting or drinking or eating the sea-view:
	say "Seawater makes you sick, or didn't you know?"
	
Instead of smelling the sea-view:
	say "It smells faintly sea-weedy."
	
Instead of rubbing the sea-view:
	try touching the sea-view.
	
Report touching the sea-view:
	say "[You] dip our hand in the water and shake it dry. ";
	if the current daytime is:
		-- noon:
			say "The water is a little brisk: this morning was cooler." instead;
		-- early afternoon:
			say "The water is still cool, but not cold." instead;
		-- mid afternoon:
			say "The water is only a little cooler than the surrounding air." instead;
		-- late afternoon:
			say "The sea has taken a lot of sun over the course of the day, and is surprisingly warm." instead;
		-- sunset:
			say "The water is still warm with the retained heat of a very sunny day." instead;
		-- evening:
			say "The water retains the heat of a very sunny day, though the air is cooling quickly." instead;

Precarious Perch is a room. It is forbidden. "From up here there's a handsome [distant-sea-view], which isn't [i]so[/i] far down [i]really[/i]. But it's a scramble down a nearly sheer cliff for the first bit, until [you] make it down to the rockfall below, and it would be easy for a careless person to injure herself." 

Rule for listing exits while looking in Precarious Perch:
	do nothing instead.

Instead of jumping in Precarious Perch:
	say "You give a sudden, mad spring before I can clamp down on the impulse, and then [you] [are] in mid-air and I can see the boulders below and time seems to be going very slowly

until it isn't.";
	end the game saying "[You] wake up four days later in hospital with one leg paralyzed".
	
Rule for distantly describing Abandoned Shore when the location is Precarious Perch:
	say "[one of]If [you] lean out over the cliff, [you] can see that there is a way down, awkward but navigable, to a small bit of sheltered shore below[if the kayak is in abandoned shore]. There even appears to be a kayak down there, though [you] can't get a good look for very long without the vertigo kicking in. So I pull back from that position. Still, it doesn't look hopeless[end if][or][You] lean out again and get another glimpse of sand and rocks[if the kayak is in abandoned shore] and kayak[end if][stopping]." instead.
		
After going down from Precarious Perch:
	let N be the number of entries in the path so far of the player;
	if N is greater than 1: 
		say "[path-walked so far]";
	otherwise:
		clear the path-walked for the player;
	say "It's a nasty business lowering ourselves over the edge, with little to hold onto up here; scrabbling around with our toes for good holds; letting go with one hand to descend a little further...

But after some minutes of this painstaking process the cliff begins to slope outward more, and it's no longer a question of climbing down a face, but rather of scrambling down over boulders. And then... [command clarification break]";
	continue the action.

Instead of going up in Abandoned Shore:
	say "[You] doubt whether [you] would make the return trip. It was bad enough coming down."
	
Instead of going north in Abandoned Shore when the player is not in the kayak:
	say "[You] have too far to go; just swimming won't get us out to Slango's yacht."

Abandoned Shore is below Precarious Perch. It is forbidden. "There's a little inlet of shore here, mostly boulders with little sand, completely cut off from the dock area and sheltered by the curve of the rock so that it wouldn't be visible from the sea unless someone were very close in."

Some boulders are scenery in Abandoned Shore. Understand "crack" or "rocks" or "boulder" as the boulders. The description is "Rough black rock, the kind that tears up your hands if you try to hold onto it too tightly."

Some tidal pools are scenery in Abandoned Shore. The description is "Pools of seawater no more than a foot or two deep, temporarily cut off from the rest of the ocean."

Instead of climbing the boulders:
	say "While it might be possible to scramble up over the curve of rock and get a glimpse of the harbor, there's an equally good possibility that doing so would get [me] undesirable attention."

The non-sand is scenery in Abandoned Shore. The non-sand is privately-named. Understand "sand" as the non-sand. 

Sanity-check doing something when the noun is non-sand or the second noun is non-sand:
	say "There's very little sand here, just boulders."
	
[Carry out examining the boulders when the squid is not seen:
	move the squid to the location;
Report examining the boulders when the squid is not seen:
	say "[A squid] has died and washed ashore in a crack of the boulders."]

[Originally, the squid here was dead and just a body washed ashore -- long before the squid became prevalent imagery in the rest of the game. But once that imagery was in place, it seemed kind of weird and depressing to have a dead squid there, so this was replaced with a different description.]

A squid is an animal on the boulders. "There is a [squid] in the tidal pools among [the boulders]." The description of a squid is "A squid, washed into a tidal pool, but not damaged. When the tide comes back in, it will be free to go."

Sanity-check saying hello to the squid:
	say "[one of]One tentacle waves back. It is probably a coincidence[or]I'm not even sure squid can hear. At any rate there is no response[stopping]." instead.

Instead of taking the squid:
	say "When [you] reach into the pool for it, it hangs onto the underlying rocks with all its strength and cannot be extracted."

Instead of smelling the squid:
	say "As it's underwater, any natural scent the squid may exude is trapped and does not reach our nostrils."
	
Instead of tasting or eating the squid:
	say "It's still alive. And while we're on the topic, raw squid meat is chewy, slippery white stuff, and doesn't agree with me."

Instead of touching the squid:
	say "Its flesh is rubbery. It wraps one tentacle around our finger."

Rule for listing exits when looking in Abandoned Shore:
	do nothing instead.

The bollard is a fixed in place thing in Abandoned Shore. "A [bollard] is bolted to one of the rocks, which is curious considering the otherwise unused and inaccessible look of the spot." Understand "bolt" or "bolted" as the bollard.
	The description is "A metal pole, painted all-weather green and bolted to a rock. Its ilk are used in more trafficked places for securing boats and so on; and indeed so is this one, despite the implausible setting."
	The heft of the bollard is 5.

The kayak is a vehicle in Abandoned Shore. "An old but still serviceable [kayak] is drawn up[if the bollard is in the location and the shackles are part of the kayak] and firmly shackled to the bollard[otherwise] here[end if]." 

The description of the kayak is "A green plastic boat, designed to be used by one person with a paddle or oar. [if the bollard is in the location and the shackles are part of the kayak]It's seaworthy, at least for reasonable distances, and shackled to the bollard for safety[otherwise]It looks seaworthy and ready to use[end if]." 

Some shackles are part of the kayak. Understand "shackle" as the shackles. The description is "They're firmly attached and locked with a rusty lock that doesn't look inclined to open again any time this century. I really do compliment you folks['] approach to security."

Instead of going somewhere by kayak when the location is Abandoned Shore:
	try launching the kayak instead.

Understand "row [something]" as launching. Understand "launch [something]" as launching. Launching is an action applying to one thing.

Does the player mean launching the kayak:
	it is very likely.

Check launching:
	if the noun is not the kayak:
		say "[The noun] [is-are]n't susceptible to being launched." instead.
	
Check launching:
	if the shackles are part of the kayak and the bollard is visible:
		say "It's hard to launch the kayak while it's still shackled to the bollard." instead.
	
Check launching:
	if the player is not in the kayak:
		if the player can see the kayak:
			try entering the kayak;
			if the player is in the kayak:
				make no decision;
		say "That might work better from inside the kayak." instead.
		
Check launching:
	if the player does not carry the oar:
		if the player can see the oar:
			try taking the oar;
			if the player carries the oar:
				make no decision;
		say "It would be helpful to have something to paddle with." instead.
		
[Check launching:
	if the player carries anything which is not the oar:
		say "Our hands are too full for rowing. [run paragraph on]";
		let worn-list be a list of things;
		let dropped-list be a list of things;
		repeat with item running through things carried by the player:
			if the item is not the oar:
				if the item is wearable:
					silently try wearing the item;
					if the player wears the item:
						add the item to the worn-list;
				otherwise:
					silently try dropping the item;
					if the player does not carry the item:
						add the item to the dropped-list;
		if the player carries anything which is not the oar:
			stop the action;
		otherwise:
			if the number of entries in the dropped-list is not 0 and the number of entries in the worn-list is not 0:
				say "[You] put down [dropped-list with definite articles] and don [worn-list with definite articles].";
			otherwise if the number of entries in the dropped-list is not 0:
				say "[You] put down [dropped-list with definite articles].";
			otherwise if the number of entries in the worn-list is not 0:
				say "[You] put down [worn-list with definite articles].";]
		
Carry out launching the kayak:
	move the kayak to the Open Sea.

Report launching the kayak:
	say "With some awkwardness, [you] manage to push off and begin to lab[our]iously row for open sea.";
	try looking.
	
Report facing in Abandoned Shore:
	say "The charm of this place is that it's very hard to see anything in any direction but the ocean. In every other direction [you] are completely protected by rocks." instead.
	
Open Sea is north of the Abandoned Shore. It is forbidden. "The water stretches in all directions, but [you] can see off to the north where [viewed-yacht] is anchored, ready to bring us back aboard. Its metallic blue shape almost blends in with the water."
	The introduction is "If [you] were further around the island to the east, [you] might be able to see bits of the drowned city: both the buildings that were legitimately destroyed when the land sunk into the sea, and the areas where during the Civil Dispute of Standard[ization] the authorities dumped unwanted foreign archaeological [if the player is wearing britishizing goggles]artefact[otherwise]artifact[end if]s. But here I'm afraid it's just shellfish and sand down there."

Rule for listing exits when looking in the Open Sea:
	do nothing instead.
	
A description-concealing rule:
	if the location is the Open Sea:
		repeat with item running through things enclosed by the kayak:
			now the item is not marked for listing.
	
The viewed-yacht is a distant, privately-named scenery thing in Open Sea. Understand "slango's" or "yacht" as the viewed-yacht. The description is "It's just there on the horizon." The printed name is "Slango's yacht".

Instead of finding viewed-yacht:
	try going north.

Instead of going a direction which is not north when the location is Open Sea:
	say "[You][']ve got safety in sight, just to the north. Don't go all sea-crazed on me now."

Instead of launching the kayak in Open Sea:
	try going north instead.
	
Instead of exiting in Open Sea:
	say "Leaving the kayak at this juncture would only get us all wet. And I'm too tired for that right now."
	
Instead of putting gel on the oar when the player is in the kayak:
	say "It would be extremely inconvenient to lose the oar at this juncture."

Understand "drift" as waiting when the location is Open sea.

Instead of waiting when the player is in Open Sea:
	say "Rest for a moment if you insist, but the currents can be odd here; it would be better to make for the yacht and rest after [you] get there."

Beside Slango's Ship is north of Open Sea. 

Instead of facing north in Open Sea:
	say "Slango's yacht is visible not too far off to the north. [You] can certainly make it."

Report facing in open sea:
	say "There is mostly ocean everywhere." instead.
	
After going to Beside Slango's Ship: 
	let N be the number of entries in the path so far of the player;
	if N is greater than 1: 
		say "[path-walked so far]";
	otherwise:
		clear the path-walked for the player;
	say "[You] come around to the aft of Slango's yacht and give a good shout. With the help of a ladder and a hand up from Slango himself, [you] soon have the kayak stored, and ourselves and our possessions on deck.[if N is greater than 1][paragraph break][end if]";
	now every other thing in the kayak is carried by the player;
	now the posture of the player is standing;
	remove the oar from play;
	set the current interlocutor to Slango;
	[queue where-is-Brock as immediate obligatory;]
	move the player to Sunning Deck, without printing a room description;
	follow the compass-drawing rule instead;
	
Chapter 2 - The Yacht

[Odds are that the average player won't see most of the detail on the yacht. That's okay with me; what I really wanted here was to give Andra a fully-fleshed home and background — after all, we've just been all over Alex's — so that if the player does choose to look at this stuff, it feels persuasive, rather than a half-hearted backdrop to the epilogue. 

The discipline of building out the True Macaque forced me to think about what Andra and Brock's life had been like before: Brock has a separate romantic history; he and Andra don't share a cabin even though they're lovers, because they spent years living separately and still need some distance from one another; and the yacht is equipped for a certain amount of self-sufficiency so that the crew can work from anywhere in the Mediterranean.]

Section 1 - Nautical Directions

Test nautical with "tutorial off / fore / fore / aft / down" in Sunning Deck.

A room can be nautical or earthbound. A room is usually not nautical. A direction can be earthbound-directional or nautical-directional. A direction is usually earthbound-directional. Starboard, port, fore, aft, up, down, the inside and the outside are nautical-directional. 

North, west, east, south, northwest, northeast, southwest, and southeast are earthbound-directional.

Rule for listing exits while looking in a nautical room:
	do nothing instead.

The starboard is a direction. The starboard has opposite port. Understand "s" or "sb" as starboard when the location is nautical.

The port is a direction. The port has opposite starboard. Understand "p" as port when the location is nautical.

The fore is a direction. The fore has opposite aft. Understand "f" as fore when the location is nautical.

The aft is a direction. The aft has opposite fore. Understand "a" or "af" as aft when the location is nautical.

The aft-port is a direction. The aft-port has opposite fore-starboard. It is nautical-directional. Understand "pa" or "ap" as aft-port when the location is nautical. 

The aft-starboard is a direction. It is nautical-directional.  The aft-starboard has opposite fore-port. Understand "sa" or "as" or "asb" as aft-starboard when the location is nautical.

The fore-port is a direction. It is nautical-directional. The fore-port has opposite aft-starboard. Understand "pf" or "fp" as fore-port when the location is nautical.

The fore-starboard is a direction. It is nautical-directional. The fore-starboard has opposite aft-port. Understand "sf" or "fs" or "fsb" as fore-starboard when the location is nautical.

Does the player mean going a nautical-directional direction when the location is nautical: it is very likely.

Index map with fore mapped as north. Index map with aft mapped as south. Index map with port mapped as west. Index map with starboard mapped as east. 

Index map with fore-port mapped as northwest. Index map with aft-port mapped as southwest. Index map with fore-starboard mapped as northeast. Index map with aft-starboard mapped as southeast. 

[Before going a nautical direction when the location is not nautical, say "Nautical directions can only be used on board ship."]

Check facing in a nautical room: 
	if the noun is not nautical-directional:
		if the location is indoors:
			say "[You] can't really see outside well enough to look off in that direction." instead;
		say "No one appears to be approaching the ship or attempting to follow us, which is the main thing." instead.

Sanity-check going an earthbound-directional direction in a nautical room:
	say "Compass directions make no sense on board ship, but you can use fore, aft, port, and starboard instead." instead.

After printing the name of a nautical room while looking:
	say "[roman type] (aboard the True Macaque)".
	
[The True Macaque is based on a blend of several yacht designs, but most of all on the '64 Wallypower' by Wally yachts of Monaco. I was looking for a design with the speed of a smuggling cigarette boat but the appearance of a luxury craft, and sufficient range to tool around non-trivial distances. This may still have been the wrong call, since I don't actually know more about yachts than I got off a website.

The yacht's name is obviously a riff on Counterfeit Monkey (Slango's reason for calling it that) but also a reference to the Squirrel Nut Zippers song Trou Macacq.]
	
When play begins:
	now every nautical room is forbidden.

Section 2 - Sunning Deck

Sunning Deck is a nautical room.
	The description is "[one of]This is a very fine boat: sleek, shiny, big... Oh, you don't like it when I put it that way, I see. All right then: a high-speed yacht, something luxurious enough that it looks like a rich man's toy to harbor officials, but it handles almost like a cigarette boat. [if the player wears the Britishizing goggles]Fibreglass[otherwise]Fiberglass[end if] hull, shaped in a deep V for racing, capable of 80 knots on a calm sea. Range of around 300 nautical miles, enough to take us past Gibraltar to Málaga or perhaps even Almeria.

This bit is the aft portion[or]This is the aft section of the deck[stopping], broad and flat and suitable for sunning oneself."


[This device is based on a broadband satellite equipment and service package offered by radio-marine.com.]

The communication unit is a fixed in place thing in the Sunning Deck. "Fixed on the roof above the entry to the navigation area is a white object that looks a little like an igloo. It is the [communication unit] that handles the yacht's wifi connection." The description is "It provides broadband access from the yacht wherever you are, from Biarritz to Istanbul, for a mere thousand euros a month. Slango frequently comments on the iniquity of this fee, but it would be impossible to do your research and make deals without it." Understand "white object" or "white" or "igloo" or "wifi" or "wireless" or "connection" as the communication unit.

Rule for writing a topic sentence about a long thing when the location is Sunning Deck:
	if at least two long things are mentionable:
		say "[The list of mentionable long things] are stacked together here, for lack of more convenient storage spaces. ";
	otherwise:
		say "[The list of mentionable long things] lies on the deck because it doesn't fit a closet. ";

Section 3 - Navigation Area

The Navigation Area is fore from the Sunning Deck. It is nautical. "[if Slango is not on the command chair]A [command chair] waits at the [controls], a mass of buttons and levers and a tiny, low-mounted steering wheel that seems like an awfully small device to control such a high-powered machine. But I'll take your word that it works.[otherwise]Arrayed on the dashboard (is that even the right word?) is a mass of buttons and levers, and a tiny, low-mounted steering wheel.[end if]

The Galley is just below, [down] a steep staircase that is almost a ladder."

Rule for writing a paragraph about Slango when Slango is on the Command Chair:
	say "Slango is in [the command chair]. He looks more relaxed driving the boat than I've ever seen him before."

The steep staircase top is a down-staircase. It is in the Navigation Area. The description is "The steps are taller than is really quite comfortable.".  The printed name is "steep staircase". Understand "ladder" as the steep staircase top.

The steep staircase bottom is an up-staircase. It is in the Galley. The description is "The stairs ascend to the navigation area on deck." The printed name is "steep staircase". Understand "ladder" as the steep staircase bottom.

The command chair is an enterable scenery supporter in the Navigation Area. The description is "Cushioned for long use, and upholstered in some kind of specially-engineered UV-resistant leather."

The controls are scenery in the Navigation Area. Understand "mass" or "buttons" or "button" or "lever" or "levers" or "steering" or "wheel" as the controls. The description is "It's curious, looking at these and knowing I've never touched them before in my life, and yet having your instinctive muscular knowledge of what they're all for and how they work. I feel like I could sit down and drive the yacht, and at the same time I find the idea terrifying."

Foredeck is fore from the Navigation Area. It is nautical. "Here the yacht is nothing but a nose over the water. A [hatch], hardly big enough for a portly person, descends into the so-called crew cabin."

Some portholes are a kind of thing. Portholes are usually scenery. The description of the portholes is usually "Perhaps I should drop any attempt to sound nautical and just call them windows, because they are not the round things one normally thinks of. But they are waterproof and just above the water line."  Understand "window" or "windows" or "porthole" or "portholes" as portholes. The printed name of portholes is always "portholes".

Instead of searching portholes:
	say "It's hard to get much of a view, just the glimmering and rolling of the water surface." 
	
Instead of opening portholes:
	say "They don't open, sensibly enough."

Check waving the letter-remover at portholes when the current setting of the letter-remover is "s":
	say "We could, but the lighting is dim enough in here already." instead.

The hatch is above the Crew Cabin and below the Foredeck. It is a door. It is openable and closed. It is scenery. The description of the hatch is "Made of tinted glass so that it also doubles as a light source for the pathetic space below."

A yacht bed is a kind of clothed bed. Two drawers are part of every yacht bed.

Instead of looking under a yacht bed:
	say "Under [the noun] [is-are a list of drawers which are part of the noun]."

The pre-drawer rule is listed before the initialize drawers rule in the when play begins rules.

This is the pre-drawer rule:
	now every drawer which is part of a yacht bed is horizontal.
	
Section 4 - Crew Cabin

The Crew Cabin is a room. It is nautical.  It is indoors. "It was meant to be mine, before we turned out to be inseparable It's... Spartan. But I didn't pay for expensive accommodations. Oh, yes, and I can understand that it must be a bother for you to give up the storage space.

I'm fascinated to note what shape a bed can be when it's not rectangular. More sort of curved and tapering. Convenient if you're called on to house a mermaid.".

Instead of looking in Crew Cabin when the player is gelled:
	say "One upside to our continuing to share the same bodies: I don't have to try to sleep in that narrow tapery bed."

The misshapen bed is a yacht bed in the Crew Cabin. The description is "It is fitted into the curve of the yacht wall, which is strongly bent here, so that the foot of the bed is tapered and narrow." It is scenery.

Some tiny portholes are portholes. They are in the Crew Cabin.

Section 5 - Galley
	
The Galley is below the Navigation Area. It is nautical. It is indoors. The description is "Smaller than the kitchen in a comfortable house, but carefully and elegantly fitted, with an electric stovetop, a convection oven/microwave, a tiny refrigerator, a sink: enough, in short, to serve the crew of three on long trips.[one of] I guess even a fairly big boat is still small on the inside, eh?[or][stopping]

There's even a little washing machine, for items too big to hand-wash in the sink.".

A built-in table is scenery in the Galley. It is a supporter. The description is "When the weather is good and there is nothing urgent happening, you all often eat out on the sunning deck, which is more congenial; but at other times you take your meals down here, on this table. The seating is built-in.". Some seating is part of the built-in table. The seating is an enterable supporter. Understand "built-in seating" as the seating.

The galley cabinet is a scenery cabinet in the Galley. 

The galley cabinet contains a bottle of ouzo and assorted staples. The description of the bottle of ouzo is "Left over from a job in Crete. It's been going slowly because Slango doesn't let anyone get drunk on [i]True Macaque[/i] and a single slug of this stuff is the upper limit."

The description of the assorted staples is "Various long-keeping foods, mostly cooked by Slango. You and Brock occasionally pitch in, but more frequently do the washing up instead. There's enough here to feed the three of you, frugally and without frills, for about a month and a half."

Some gameshelves are scenery in the Galley. The printed name is "built-in shelves". Understand "shelf" or "shelves" or "built-in" as the gameshelves.

On the gameshelves is a game-selection. Understand "games" or "game" or "battered" or "selection" or "selection of games" as the game-selection.

Rule for writing a paragraph about something which is on the gameshelves:
	say "On the port wall, built-in shelves hold [a list of things on the gameshelves]."

The description of the game-selection is "Oh, all sorts: Boggle and Scrabble, which you always win and which therefore Brock and Slango only play when they're in a mood for cheering you up. Monopoly, dusty with disuse. Puerto Rico. Arkham Horror. It's surprising what even Brock will admit to being amused by in the course of a long evening at sea." The printed name of the game-selection is "battered selection of games".

[Arkham Horror is a game designed by G. Kevin Wilson, who also happens to be the originator of SPAG magazine and an enthusiastic contributor to the early IF community. It is also an incredibly detailed game with a bazillion pieces, and about as unsuitable for shipboard play as any boardgame could be.] 

Understand "boggle" or "scrabble" or "monopoly" or "arkham" or "horror" or "puerto" or "rico" as the game-selection.

Instead of doing something other than examining when the noun is the game-selection or the second noun is the game-selection:
	if looking at the game-selection through something:
		continue the action;
	say "This doesn't seem to be a game-playing sort of occasion."


Some wide portholes are portholes. They are in the galley.

The washing machine is a closed openable scenery container in the Galley. The description is "It's efficient enough, but only works when plugged into water and power in a marina. It would be too draining to run off the yacht's resources in open sea. [paragraph break]Besides, you don't have a dryer, which means laundry has to be put up on a string above-decks, and that's not a practical thing to do when you might be having to make a fast get-away in the near future."

A refrigerator called a galley refrigerator is in the Galley. 
	The printed name is "[if looking]refrigerator[otherwise]galley refrigerator[end if]".
	The description is "Like the other fittings of the kitchen, it's handsomely sleek with shiny black surfaces. An unnecessary frill, but it fits the bored-playboy-yachts-around-Mediterranean cover that Slango likes to put up. (Brock plays the lead role.)

The rest of the food is in the cabinet."

A stove called a galley stove is in the Galley. The description of the galley stove is "A perfectly smooth, easy-to-clean black surface with electric burners underneath."

A sink called a galley sink is in the Galley. The description of the galley sink is "Stainless steel, and very clean."

The multipurpose oven is fixed in place scenery in the Galley. It is an openable closed transparent container. Understand "convection" or "microwave" as the multipurpose oven. The description is "A versatile piece of machinery that can either microwave or convection-heat things. It's not terribly powerful at either task, but it suffices and moreover is very compact."

When play begins:
	let target be a random freezer compartment which is part of the Galley refrigerator;
	move the fig ice cream to the target;
	move the frozen dinners to the target; 
	move the bottle of vodka to the target;
	let target oven be a random oven which is part of the Galley stove;
	remove the target oven from play. [because we want a special microwave/convection oven in there instead.]
	
A fig ice cream is a thing. The indefinite article is "some". The description is "Brock got this for a lark, but it turns out no one likes it."

Some frozen dinners are a thing. The description is "French frozen food, which I gather from your thoughts [--] obviously I've never tasted the stuff [--] is miles better than any other kind of frozen food, in the sense of actually tasting good."

A bottle of vodka is a thing. The description is "Half empty, typically drunk exclusively by Brock."

A jar of caviar is a thing. It is in the Galley refrigerator. The description is "Most of it is gone, used up in Brock's great crepes experiment of last weekend."

Instead of taking something which is in a freezer compartment when the location is the Galley:
	say "No one's hungry right now."
	
Instead of inserting something into a freezer compartment:
	say "There's no point in freezing [the noun]."
	
Section 6 - Brock's Stateroom

Brock's Stateroom is fore from the Galley. It is nautical .  It is indoors. The description is "Bigger than your bunk or Slango's, Brock's space takes the whole width of the yacht here, with windows out both sides, and a double bed.

The shape of hull in this part of the yacht means that the room is much narrower fore than aft, the walls sweeping grandly outward from the head of [Brock's bed]. It looks like the bed of Captain Horndog, Space Woman[ize]r. If you ask me."



Brock's bed is a yacht bed in Brock's Stateroom. It is scenery. The description is "Brock affects a kind of ruffled bachelor style, which means that his bed is made but the blankets suggestively rumpled. It is an open question whether he rumples them himself on purpose."
 

When play begins:
	let N be random sheets which are part of a bed in Brock's Stateroom;
	change the description of N to "Egyptian cotton, high thread count, dyed deep black. Whether this is part of the luxury look of the boat or a preference of Brock's is a question you've never felt like asking.";
	let N be random pillow which is part of a bed in Brock's Stateroom;
	change the description of N to "Cased to match the sheets.";
	let N be random blanket which is part of a bed in Brock's Stateroom;
	change the description of N to "Just a very light cashmere throw blanket. Takes rumples well.";
	let target drawer be a random leftmost drawer which is part of a bed in Brock's Stateroom;
	let target drawer be a random rightmost drawer which is part of a bed in Brock's Stateroom;
	move the expensive laptop to the target drawer;
	move the mess of cabling to the target drawer;
	move the DVDs to the target drawer.
	
Understand "blankets" as a blanket.
	
The expensive laptop is a laptop. The description is "It's Brock's fav[our]ite object in the whole world: glossy display, unibody aluminum shell, vast hard drive. He uses it to research jobs and set up contacts."

[Instead of doing something other than examining when the expensive laptop is the noun or the expensive laptop is the second noun:
	say "Brock would cut our fingers off. But it's password-protected anyway; we wouldn't even be able to play solitaire on it." ]
	
The expensive laptop is running a password lock program called Brock's security.
	The password of Brock's security is "2!ch_nqrx@v".
	
The expensive laptop is running a multiple-choice program called Brock-OS.
	The options table of Brock-OS is the Table of GUI Choices.
	
Table of GUI Choices
topic	title	effect
"photos/pictures/photographs" or "my" or "my photos"	"Photos"	photo-display rule
"games"	"Game"	game-display rule

This is the game-display rule:
	say "Brock's game collection runs most strongly to very detailed simulation and strategy games: Crusader Kings, a couple of flight simulators, Realistic Tractors 2011 Edition."

This is the photo-display rule:
	say "Images flash quickly across the screen. They are, to your surprise, not pornographic; to mine, they are not especially suggestive of criminal activity. Just a bunch of snaps of you and Brock and Slango, and occasionally other people, enjoying what appear to be rigorously ordinary holidays in various Mediterranean ports."
	 
The mess of cabling is a thing. The description of the mess of cabling is "Power adaptors for various different plug styles; ethernet, USB, firewire cables ranging from new to nearly obsolete formats; security devices, dongles, things I don't even recogn[ize]." Understand "adaptors" or "power" or "ethernet" or "usb" or "firewire" or "cables" or "devices" or "dongles" as the mess of cabling.

Instead of doing something other than examining when the mess of cabling is the noun or the laptop is the second noun:
	say "I know what some of this stuff is for, but none of it would be handy now."
	
Some DVDs are a thing. The description of the DVDs is "A stack of unlabeled data DVDs in clear plastic cases. They could be anything: backup information on the jobs you've done, his music collection, porn. Knowing Brock, you would guess some of all three."

Instead of doing something other than examining when the DVDs is the noun or the DVDs is the second noun:
	say "I know what some of this stuff is for, but none of it would be handy now."
	
[The portrait is a thing. Understand "big" or "glossy" or "8 x 10" or "annalisa" or "photograph" or "photo" or "of annalisa" as the portrait. The description is "It's a big glossy 8 x 10 photograph of Annalisa: one of those intimate candid shots that says a world about the relationship of the sitter to the man behind the camera. 

She's not looking at the lens. Her face is a little averted. Brock has shot her as though she were a rare orchid [--] narrow depth of field, natural light, extreme close-up [--] so that she doesn't seem so much like a person; so that she breaks into components of form and texture. A childlike curve of cheek. Fair, freckled skin. Downswept lashes.

This is the photograph that he has not thrown away. A casual observer might be excused for thinking that she initiated the breakup and Brock was still carrying a torch. But it was just the opposite, of course." ]


Some front portholes are portholes. They are in Brock's Stateroom.

Section 7 - Brock's Head

Brock's Head is aft-port from Brock's Stateroom. It is nautical .  It is indoors.  It is a bathroom. "Brock has gotten the best accommodations in this respect as well: his bathroom is less cramped than the others aboard, and the mirror is bigger."

Instead of going starboard in Brock's Head:
	try going fore-starboard.
	
Instead of going fore in Brock's Head:
	try going fore-starboard. 
	
Section 8 - Your Bunk
	
Your Bunk is aft-starboard from the Galley.  It is nautical .  It is indoors. The description is "Amazing: it's even tinier than my apartment, and the bed isn't even a twin in width. Across from the bed is a built-in [bench], with [random portholes] above, just at the waterline."

The bench is an enterable supporter in Your Bunk. It is scenery. The description is "It's hard and less comfortable than a sofa, but it is adequate for seating on the rare occasions when a second person comes into your room. Mostly you read on the bed."

Some financial records are a thing. The clipping is a thing. The description of the financial records is "Brock and Slango managed for you at first, depositing your part of job commissions into a Swiss bank account. It is only recently that you've started to branch out in managing that money. After your wire transfer to your brother, you have only a few tens of thousands of dollars left, but that will change when you get your share for rescuing the plans of the T-inserter."

The description of the clipping is "This is a clipping from your hometown paper, from when you took second place in a national spelling bee at the age of twelve. Years of training and study, practice every night of the week, and [i]your parents were satisfied when you placed second[/i]. They were proud. Your mother gave an interview on TV. 

All that stuff about the struggle to achieve perfection as man's gift back to God, or whatever? They made that up. They were happy to cash in on your not-quite-perfect performance in the end, happy to be local celebrities for two weeks, happy to tell everyone how they trained you up and what good parents they were. You were humiliated by your loss at the last moment, and they didn't care. Enter Slango in your life, and cue your departure; and you haven't seriously looked back since.

...Well. If I may be permitted a word (and I don't see how you could stop me, sorry): I don't think they were hypocrites. I think they meant well. But I can understand how all that would have done a heck of a job on your head."

Your wardrobe is an openable closed container in Your Bunk. It is fixed in place. "[if your wardrobe is open]Your wardrobe door is open[otherwise]Your wardrobe door is firmly closed, which is helpful because otherwise it is tricky walking around in here[end if]." Understand "door" as the wardrobe.

Your wardrobe contains a sundress, a black turtleneck, some trousers, and a swimsuit. 
	The sundress, black turtleneck, trousers, and swimsuit are wearable. 
	The description of the sundress is "Bought during a vacation in Nauplia. It was tempting to look like the other tourists. And why not?" The sundress covers the torso-area.
	The description of the black turtleneck is "It averts attention and is useful on jobs." The turtleneck covers the torso-area.
	The description of the trousers is "Close-fitting and dark col[our]ed, useful to wear when going places sneakily by night."  The trousers cover the legs-area.
	The description of the swimsuit is "Often the only form of exercise available is swimming off the back of the True Macaque, and Slango insists that you and Brock do this daily if on-shore forms of exertion are not available. It's a one-piece suit, meant for function rather than show." The swimsuit covers the torso-area.

Sanity-check wearing the sundress:
	say "I would kind of feel like it was cross-dressing, if that makes sense." instead.
	
Sanity-check wearing the swimsuit:
	say "I'm not quite ready to appear in spandex in my [--] that is, our [--] new bod." instead.
	 
	
[Instead of wearing the trousers:
	say "There's no need to change just now."
	
Instead of wearing the black turtleneck:
	say "There's no need to change just now."]

When play begins:
	let d be a random rightmost drawer that is part of a bed in Your Bunk;
	move the financial records to d;
	let d be a random leftmost drawer that is part of a bed  in Your Bunk; 
	move the clipping to d;

Every turn when the player can see portholes:
	if a random chance of 1 in 13 succeeds:
		say "[one of]Odd patterns of light dance on the ceiling, reflected through the portholes from the water outside.[or]The yacht rolls gently under the influence of an especially strong wave.[or]The waves lap gently against the side of the ship.[or]Just outside the porthole, a seabird is visible resting on the waves; and then it floats on.[or]The wake of what must be quite a large ship raises the [i]True Macaque[/i] and then lowers her again.[as decreasingly likely outcomes]".

Your bed is a yacht bed in your bunk. It is scenery. The description is "Homely but familiar." 

Some back portholes are portholes. They are in your bunk.

Instead of going fore in Your Bunk:
	try going fore-port.

Section 10 - Your Head

Your Head is aft from Your Bunk. It is nautical. It is a bathroom.  It is indoors.  "All the absolutely required amenities of a bathroom, packed into the least possible space. The international space station assigns more room to the bathroom functions."

Section 11 - Slango's Bunk

Slango's Bunk is aft-port from the Galley.  It is nautical.  It is indoors. The description is "Just as tiny as yours, with a bed narrower than a standard twin, and its own miniature head, and drawers cunningly fitted under the bed to hold clothing and other necessities."

Instead of going fore in Slango's Bunk:
	try going fore-starboard.

Some side portholes are portholes. They are in Slango's bunk.

Slango's bed is a yacht bed in Slango's bunk. It is scenery. The description is "Hospital corners, military precision. Slango never actually served in the armed forces to the best of your knowledge, but that hasn't stopped him acting like it." 

Instead of doing something other than examining to something that is part of Slango's bed:
	say "Neither of us is quite comfortable invading Slango's privacy in that way."
	
Section 12 - Slango's Head

Slango's Head is aft from Slango's Bunk. It is nautical .  It is indoors. It is a bathroom. "All the absolutely required amenities of a bathroom, packed into the least possible space. The international space station probably assigns more room to the bathroom functions."

When play begins:
	repeat with item running through baths which are in nautical bathrooms:
		change the printed name of the item to "shower";
		change the description of the item to "Just a stand-up shower with a folding plastic door. At least the water is usually hot."

Section 13 - View from Outdoor Areas

The island is a distant backdrop. It screens south. It is in Open Sea and Sunning Deck and Navigation Area and Foredeck. The description is "From here, [you] can see a lot of the shoreline: the Custom House on the top of its cliff (which at a distance doesn't seem very tall at all); the harbor and the docks, both the touristy portion and the more industrial areas; and then the headland and the ramparts of the old city, with the cannon emplacements (now disused). [You] can even make out just a bit of the sandier beaches on the northwest shore of the island, though at this distance it is impossible to people-watch." Understand "atlantis" or "anglophone" or "shore" or "shoreline" or "dock" or "docks" or "cliff" or "custom" or "house" or "cannon" or "ramparts" or "emplacements" or "old city" or "city" or "beach" or "beaches" or "sand" or "people" as the island.
	
The cathedral-view is a distant backdrop. The printed name is "cathedral of Palma". Understand "cathedral" or "palma" or "of palma" or "yachts" or "mallorca" as cathedral-view. It screens port. The description is "The cathedral of Palma stands over the water and any number of waiting yachts. It is the first place I've ever seen outside the island of Atlantis [--] that wasn't a picture or a movie, of course. It looks overdone and a bit dirty and also like the only solid thing in view."

Book 6 - Map Declarations

Chapter 1 - Main Map

[ The idea of having a map came in fairly early in the project, but it wasn't until late that I decided on the style. 

I felt that this was the single most important piece of art to provision, since the player was going to have to spend the whole game staring at it, but even though I found some artists whose styles I really liked in general, I wasn't sure they suited Atlantis. I wanted something that instantly conveyed a sense of the major thoroughfares and significant monuments, but didn't take away from the pleasure of reading room descriptions for the first time. I wanted something less bland than a street map, less silly than a standard tourist map. It also needed to be clean enough not to distract the player with locations that weren't going to be accessible, and that was tricky because in practice this amount of urban space would contain many many more buildings than the player actually gets to go inside.

Ultimately I decided the typographical map would provide the right level of abstraction, fit Atlantis better than any of the other options, and also be something I might be able to put together myself. I started by having Inform build an EPS map of the game space, and then I started layering text layers over that. The majority of the fonts used are from the collection of HP Lovecraft Historical Society prop fonts ( http://www.cthulhulives.org/toybox/propdocs/propfonts.html ), a collection I bought a few years ago and have found almost endlessly useful: they come in many weights and densities and play together nicely.

There are a couple of exceptions. The font used for the half-hidden Greek font under New Church is Porson, a classic 19th century font for Greek lettering and one of my favorites for extended reading. The Bureau buildings are done inevitably in medium Helvetica, which is intentionally unaesthetic in context. Hoefler Ornaments provides the printer's ornament for the center of the roundabout.

For the player's you-are-here symbol, I used a nethack-like @ . I also experimented with a double dagger ‡ -- which to my eye was vaguely reminiscent of a stick figure but sort of doubled, as Alex and Andra are. But in the end I found that the round form of the @ was easier to position attractively in a range of locations; it especially looked better inside the O of the rotunda or inside the turret.

The @ sign indicating the player could in theory be placed as a transparent sprite over the appropriate part of the map. In practice, however, I needed to do a lot of brightness and outline adjustment to the @ sign depending on what was going beneath it. There were also particular small touches that would have been harder to add with a sprite, such as rotating the @ sign when the player was traveling on the winding path to the beach, or showing it underneath a layer of other text when the player was down in the crawlspace. I wanted the map to have a playful quality -- to feel individually considered, rather than mechanized. 

Consequently, each place where the player's @ can appear gets its own copy of the image.

These are the definitions of images associated with room maps. They have to go after the rooms themselves are defined, and it was easier keeping them all in one place than scattering the declarations through the rest of code, so this section could be commented out for testing.]

Chapter 2 - Inside the Bureau

[

The design aims for the Bureau-internal maps are:

-- to create a sense of forward movement and discovery, both by opening new territory that the protagonists haven't seen before, and by rewarding the player's exploration with further map revelations
-- to establish a kind of chaos and alarm in the Wonderland portions of the map

]

Chapter 3 - Aboard the Yacht

[The yacht plans are different in almost every respect from the maps elsewhere. They use images exclusively rather than words, replace the player's @ sign with a yellow you-are-here star, and portray close-up details (such as beds and even toilets) that wouldn't even be hinted at in the main game area.

The design aims for the yacht plans are:

-- to convey the scope and concept of the yacht almost instantly, because the player will have relatively little time to explore
-- to make it clear that we're in a different sort of environment -- metaphysically different, even -- from Atlantis, and to suggest movement away from Atlantis (the bottom half of the screen is Bureau blue, the top half black)
-- to establish the claustrophobic self-containment of this little world
-- to keep rewarding the player with slightly surprising new visuals even at the end of the game

Volume 3 - Memories

[Memories are not exactly cut scenes, but are intended to have limited interactions: no world model, just choices about what to reveal to Alex and what emotional approach to take to certain events, where Andra's real feelings are probably complex and ambivalent. The idea here is where possible to allow expressiveness and engagement with the events but not to make them seem subject to actual change.

These are a fairly late addition to the design, because Andra's personality is losing out to Alex's significantly, and thematically we would really like to give an impression of both of them.]

[Section 0 - Emotional Terminology for Later Parsing

Understand "angry/mad/pissed/furious/wrath/rage/enraged/offended/infuriated" as "[angry]".
Understand "jealous/envious" as "[jealous]".
Understand "annoyed/irritated/frustrated" as "[annoyed]".
Understand "bored/ennui/uninterested/disinterested/indifferent/uncaring/dull/yawn/tedious/tedium/apathy" as "[bored]".

Section 1 - Memory Terms

A memory is a kind of thing. A memory can be triggered, proto-triggered, or untriggered. A memory is usually untriggered. A memory is usually fixed in place.

A memory has a number called the uses. 
A memory has a number called the max.
A memory has a number called the last trigger. The last trigger of a memory is usually 0.

Understand "remember" or "memories" or "memory" as listing memories. Listing memories is an action out of world.

Report listing memories:
	say "Currently on your mind [is-are a list of triggered memories][one of]. [paragraph break][first custom style][bracket]REMEMBER any memory to review it.[close bracket][roman type][or].[stopping]";
	
To trigger (new memory - a memory): 
	let elapsed count be the turn count - last trigger of the new memory; 
	if the uses of the new memory is less than the max of the new memory and elapsed count is greater than 2:
		now the new memory is proto-triggered;
		change the last trigger of the new memory to the turn count;
	
Before reading a command when a memory is proto-triggered:
	say "[one of]Something makes you think of[or]You have a fleeting thought of[or]You are reminded of[at random] [the list of proto-triggered memories].";
	now every proto-triggered memory is triggered;
	if we have not remembered:
		say "[line break][first custom style][bracket]MEMORIES will list your currently active memories[close bracket][roman type]";

Understand "remember [any triggered memory]" as remembering. Understand "think about [any triggered memory]" as remembering. Remembering is an action applying to one visible thing.

First carry out remembering a memory:
	increase the uses of the noun by 1.
	
Report remembering:
	say "Then we're back in the present.[line break]".
	
Sanity-check remembering when the location is Roundabout and the player is in the car:
	say "Hey! Now isn't the time for reveries! Watch the road." instead.
	
Remembering something is acting fast. Listing memories is acting fast.


Section 2 - First Recollection of the Yacht

lock-formation is a memory. The printed name is "making your lock". Understand "making" or "your/my" or "lock" as lock-formation. The max is 1.

Carry out examining the lock:
	trigger lock-formation.

Carry out remembering lock-formation:
	say "[b]Galley[/b][line break]You were going through the galley cupboards on the yacht. 'If you're looking for coffee, Slango forgot to resupply,' Brock said, descending the galley staircase in a wet Speedo.

'No, the first-letter razor,' you replied, holding up a portable clock. 'I need a lock that responds to restoration gel but nothing else.'

'Ah.' Brock toweled his hair. 'It's in my bunk, sorry. Want to come look for it?'

You smiled [--] a give-away smile. 'Wish I could, but we're on a deadline. Go put some pants on. And bring me the razor.'"

Section 3 - Childhood

Childhood-colonialism is a memory. The printed name is "my youthful pranks". The max is 1. Understand "my/your" or "youthful" or "youth" or "pranks" as childhood-colonialism.

Carry out remembering childhood-colonialism:
	say "Oh, I used to play that I was an Atlantean guard defending the battlements against invading redcoats, armed only with a saber and an, uh, an o-removing musket. So they turned into red cats, you see. My mother explained later that letter removal hadn't ever taken the form of muskets and that I had my chronology wrong. So I do know better. 

And my father gave me an even longer and even less interesting lecture about how the British colonial government wasn't entirely a bad thing and how it didn't do to be too gleeful about mentally shooting some young soldier who probably didn't have a choice about being there." 

Childhood-bedroom is a memory. The printed name is "your austere childhood". The max is 3. Understand "my/your" or "childhood" or "austere" as childhood-bedroom. 

Carry out examining the funnel:
	trigger childhood-bedroom. [Your youth in contrast with this privileged childhood]
	
Carry out examining the school:
	trigger childhood-bedroom.

Carry out remembering childhood-bedroom:
	if the uses of the noun is:

			say "[b]Your Childhood Bedroom[/b][line break]A small white room with a free-standing wardrobe full of modest home-made clothes; a plain-hewn bookshelf with Bible, study guides, a dictionary and thesaurus; and a sampler on the far wall that reads, 'Our pursuit of perfection is our gift to God.' It's done in very exact cross-stitch.";
		-- 2: say "[b]Your Childhood Bedroom[/b][line break]You hung your newly ironed clothes in the wardrobe. Your clothes were frumpy foolish things. But they were made for you by your parents with great care. Your father made the wardrobe himself. Your mother sewed all your clothes. She had an eye for col[our] and detail. It shows in the neatness of the hems, the crisp piping on a pocket, the surprising yellow buttons on a pale blue cuff. [paragraph break]Every day you wore those clothes was like being arm[our]ed in love.";
		-- 3:  
			say "[b]Your Kitchen[/b][line break]Your mother sits at the kitchen table sipping a strong tea while she coaches you through your routine. This is what informed your life, every day. Every morning, the hours of spelling practice. Your mother's words about how you must nurture your talent in gratitude to the deity who bestowed it on you.";
		-- otherwise:  
			say "The recollections blur together now, rejected and useless.";
 

Section 3 - Back Alley

But we couldn't move, even though you were half-conscious. So he panicked. We'd paid him to let us recover in comfort, but he wasn't about to risk having a corpse on his hands, even an unidentified one. He picked us up and dumped our body in the Back Alley and left."
	

Section 4 - Brock Goodnatured

Carry out examining protesters:
	trigger saving-rivka.

saving-rivka is a memory. The printed name is "your crew's heroism". The max is 1. Understand "your/my" or "crew" or "crew's" or "heroism" as saving-rivka.

Carry out remembering saving-rivka:
	say "[b]Galley[/b][line break]The scene is the kitchen aboard Slango's yacht: smaller than the kitchen in a comfortable house, but carefully and elegantly fitted. Brock and Slango were standing around, Slango with a lemonade and Brock with a chilled vodka. [paragraph break]The fourth person on the scene was Rivka Coutinho, a prisoner you'd sprung from Atlantean custody. She'd been caught running an illicit Hebrew school while nominally a visiting foreign employee of DCL.[paragraph break]";
	say "'To not being in Cold Storage,' said Rivka, lifting her own glass. She swallowed and her eyes watered a little. [paragraph break]Rivka had spent the previous seventeen years as an inanimate object in a Bureau warehouse.[paragraph break]'You'll be with them soon,' Brock said. 'But I took these for you.' Silently he passed across the table glossy prints of Rivka's daughter and granddaughter [--] a child she had never met."

A four-thousand dollar mink blanket covered your hip.[paragraph break]You sat up and started fishing around beside the bed, in the dove-grey shadows, for your bra.[paragraph break]Brock put a hand on your thigh. It seems you woke him.

'That wasn't your first time,' he said.

'No.' You were still feeling for the underpants and the shirt, not looking at him. 

'Well. You're made of human after all.' Brock stretched, grinned. 'After breakfast I'll clear you some drawer space.'

'This was a one-night event,' you said. 'You're familiar with the concept.'

He got very still. Then he got out of bed. Without looking at you, he got his trunks out of his drawer. 'I'm going for a swim.'";
		-- 2: say "[b]Navigation Area[/b][line break]Brock was sitting at the controls, with you leaning over him. He pushed you away. 'Cut it out. I'm not available every time you decide to go slumming.'[paragraph break]It was deep blue summer twilight. He was driving the yacht with one hand on the steering wheel and the other loosely in his lap. You turned to go."; 
		-- 3: say "[b]Sunning Deck[/b][line break]Brock was sprawled out on the cushions with his sunglasses on. Pretending not to see you. You stood so that your shadow crossed his face and he had to look up.
		
'I've been a jerk and I'm sorry,' you said.

'I'm not the man-whore of Babylon,' he replied. 'I've had the odd fling. That's all.'

'I know.'

'I'm not James Bond here.'

You pulled your towel more tightly around you. 'I know.'

'And you have lost the right ever to give me crap about women again,' he said.

Your teeth were starting to chatter. 'Yes.' 

'Okay. Apology accepted.' He lowered his sunglasses again.";
		-- 4: say "[b]Café, Marseilles[/b][line break]Brock was scowling into his drink. 'I don't know, Andra. Are you going to flip on me again if we try to be together? I'm not blaming you for your parents, and... honestly, I'm surprised how much you've been able to assemble yourself into someone new. But jeezus.'

'What happened to your thing about how everyone goes through life hurting everyone else a little bit, like radiation?' you asked. 'But mostly people heal, and it's worth it?'

'Yeah, that's true,' he said. 'But you still don't go into the reactor core with no suit, if you see what I mean.'

You tilted your head. 'You weathered it pretty well when you and Annalisa split up.'

He swirled the melted ice in the bottom of his glass. 'Is this what you're fishing for?' he said. 'For me to tell you you're special, you're different, I care about you more and therefore it would ruin everything if we ever broke up?'

You didn't answer.

'It [i]would[/i] ruin everything,' he says. 'Because you're on my crew. But as to the girlfriend thing, I have no idea. We don't know each other that way.'";
		-- 5: say "[b]Brock's Stateroom[/b][line break]Brock had tied your wrists to the headboard and your left ankle to the corner of the bed. He had a thesaurus open and was writing, with a paintbrush, across your stomach. 

'Floozy?' he asked.

You giggled, so he painted the word above your navel, smiling, giving the Y a big flourishing curlicue.

'Let's see, what else. Fornicator?'

You drew in your breath sharply. Remembering an angry lesson read from the lectern.

'Okay,' he said. 'Not that one, yet,' and licked away the F he'd begun to paint.";

A clean-lined, minimal room, but furnished expensively: fresh-cut tulips in a plain glass vase, high thread-count sheets, vast pillows suitable for the hibernation of giants. The closets feature safes, which is excellent for someone in your line of work, because it tends to persuade guests that their computers are being protected when they go out.

You were inside because you'd bribed a housekeeper, and were gathering information from a businessman's laptop while the businessman himself was downstairs at the bar.

But the Bureau also had an agent, also posing as a housekeeper in the hotel, also up to the same purposes. The business with the minibar vodka was clever, I grant."; 
	else: 
		say "[b]A Room in a Villa[/b][line break]The bed was draped with sheer salmon-col[our]ed fabric. The bedroom opened without doors straight onto the bathroom with a full view of the spotlit bathtub. The toilet was hidden by a frosted glass panel etched with leaping fish. It was the swankest place you'd ever seen, and it made you uncomfortable.
	
'Belongs to a seafood magnate,' your crew-mate Brock was explaining. He was in the middle of setting up a directional mike pointed out the window. The head of R&D at Sibilant Solutions lived right across the way. What you learned from his pillow-talk was enough to recover three missing marquesses.";

Slango grimaced. 'Pay's chickenshit. And what a job. Getting a name like [']Nexami['] past Atlantean border control? So some guy can do a concert tour? Come on. Where does that go on our résumé? Right after [']brought down international conspiracy by Sibilant Solutions'? It's hiring a neuro-oncologist to treat your pet gerbil.[']

'We got ourselves credentials,' Brock remarked. 'We're not exactly the most solid upstanding ordinary-named guys.'

'Because in our line of work it's useful not to be. Plus I would do a job for myself that I wouldn't do for anyone else. Obviously.'

'This is a job for a virtuoso,' Brock said. 'Pure challenge, no obvious social engineering solutions. Not to mention, if it turns out we can't deliver, what's this guy going to do about it? He's a musician.'

Slango still didn't look impressed.

'It's [i]breaking Atlantean law[/i],' Brock added temptingly. 'And there's no law that needs breaking [--]'

'[--] more than Atlantean law,' you and Slango chorused with him.

You shrugged. 'People L-remove tiles,' you said. 'You can get a letter-made tie any col[our] you want.'

'Import Category 5,' Brock said. 'Now that would be a strong challenge category.' Under Atlantean customs law, Import Category 5 means things that are edible, but not fruits or vegetables [--] everything from drugs to chicken breasts. 'Clear, but it rules out a lot of overly productive agriculture words.'"

More than he real[ize]d, in fact, now that you've added my tiles to yours."

Volume 4 - Tools and Substances Affecting Letters



Book 1 - Safety Overrides and Disasters

Section 1 - Dangerous Destruction

[No matter what method of letter modification we use, there are certain things it is dangerous to destroy: for instance, objects containing the player, objects containing valuable essentials, etc. We want to be consistent in the way we represent the results, so we use the dangerous destruction rulebook, which can be called by any of the letter-changing devices.]

The dangerous destruction rules are an object-based rulebook.  

A dangerous destruction rule for a person (called the target):
	if the target is the current interlocutor:
		reset the interlocutor; 
		
A dangerous destruction rule for something that encloses the current interlocutor:
	reset the interlocutor; 
	
A dangerous destruction rule for something (called changed seat) which encloses a person (called the irate victim):
	if the irate victim is Brock:
		make no decision;
	if the irate victim is the player:
		say "In a blink of an eye, [the changed seat] ceases to exist.
	
The problem is that [it-they of changed seat] take[s] us along with [it-them of changed seat].

I've always wondered what this last passage to non-existence might be like. It turns out that there is a rushing noise, and a tunnel [you] travel very rapidly towards darkness; and all around us are other objects also in the middle of ceasing to be.";
		end the game saying "[You] have left existence behind";
		rule fails;
	say "Instantly [the changed seat] cease[s] to exist. [The irate victim], real[izing] what [you] [are] about just in time, has managed to leap out of the way, however; and the result is a hasty call to the police to report an Attempt to Render Inanimate, a charge pursued as though it were murder in most circumstances.";
	end the game saying "[You] have been locked up";
	rule fails. 

A dangerous destruction rule for a room (called changed seat):
	say "In a blink of an eye, [the changed seat] ceases to exist, and [you] are part of it, and go also[if the location contains at least two people], in what will be recorded as an inexplicable act of murder-suicide[end if].
	
I've always wondered what this last passage to non-existence might be like. It turns out that there is a rushing noise, and a tunnel [you] travel very rapidly towards darkness; and all around us are other objects also in the middle of ceasing to be.";
	end the game saying "[You] have left existence behind";
	rule fails.  
	
Section 2 - Dangerous Construction

Definition: a thing is enormous if the heft of it is greater than 8.

The dangerous construction rules are an object-based rulebook.  

A dangerous construction rule for the ape:
	say "The ape turns its face towards us and takes us in dislike. Its dislike involves a lot of hitting and ooking and throwing, and overall turns out quite painful.";
	end the story saying "That could have gone better";
	rule succeeds.
	
A dangerous construction rule for something enormous (called the target):
	say "Unfortunately, [the target] [is-are] more than sufficient to bury us under [its-their] bulk.";
	end the story saying "That could have gone better";
	rule succeeds;
	
Report waving the letter-remover at something creating the all:
	abide by the dangerous construction rules for the all.
	
A dangerous construction rule for the all:
	say "There is a hum of ferocious effort from the letter-remover as it strains to create 'all'. At first it seems likely that it will just break down, but ";
	if the letter-remover is creature-enabled:
		say "it gets through the aa (a spontaneous flow of lava) and the aardvark, before the aardwolf attacks and does us in.";
	otherwise:
		say "it gets through the aa (a spontaneous flow of lava); skips all creatures of the aard- variety thanks to its restraints on living animal-creation; and goes on to the abaca (a large hemp-yielding plant).

Unfortunately, it's done a bit too zealous a job with the aa, and before it gets to whatever comes after abaca, the lava is flowing in our direction.";
	end the story saying "That could have gone better";
	rule succeeds;
	
A last dangerous construction rule for a freaky thing (called target) when the current interlocutor is the backpacking girl:
	try showing the target to the backpacking girl.
	
A last dangerous construction rule for a freaky thing (called target) when the current interlocutor is the volunteer:
	if the volunteer does not recollect broke-it-buy-it and the target is proffered by the tomes:
		casually queue broke-it-buy-it;
	otherwise:
		casually queue mess-complaint.	
		
A dangerous construction rule for the hoses:
	now the hoses are part of the marble fountain.
		
A dangerous construction rule for the hoe:
	now the hoe is part of the marble fountain.
	
A dangerous construction rule for the horses:
	now the horses are part of the marble fountain.
  	
Test mis1 with "load gun / autoupgrade / shoot lap" holding the anagramming gun and the letter-remover and the ball and the lap and the pea and the bullets.
Test mis2 with "load gun / autoupgrade / shoot pea" holding the anagramming gun and the letter-remover and the ball and the lap and the pea and the bullets.
Test mis3 with "load gun / autoupgrade / wave b-remover at ball / shoot lap" holding the anagramming gun and the letter-remover and the ball and the lap and the pea and the bullets.

Test mis4 with "z / wave y-remover at army" in the Dormitory holding the letter-remover and the army.

Book 2 - Hashing

[ While it is possible to do the object comparisons for this game entirely in Inform 7 native code, doing so becomes very computationally expensive, especially for ambitious tools such as the anagramming gun: we are manipulating indexed text and lists multiple times for each of hundreds of objects.

So to get around this, we start the game by caching information about each object in a way that allows us to filter later what comparisons we're going to need to make. 

For each object, we assign a code that is a bitmap indicating which letters of the alphabet appear in that object. (Not how many times those letters appear or in what order or even how many letters there are -- so BED and BEDE would have the same hash code, as would ABED and BEAD, and so on. Moreover, bitwise comparisons allow us to and/or these lists of letters so that we can see that BEND with N removed does have the same letters as BED, all without having to manipulate any indexed text.) 

The point of this is to be able to rapidly eliminate the majority of comparisons without ever having to do the more expensive analysis of specific letters.

Thanks to Graham Nelson for technical assistance on this. ]

A thing has a number called the hash code.
A room has a number called the hash code.

When play begins (this is the initialize hash codes rule):
	repeat with item running through things which are not facts:
		let T be indexed text;
		let T be "[item]";
		now the item is unseen;
		now the hash code of the item is letter-hash of T;
	repeat with item running through rooms:
		let T be indexed text;
		let T be "[item]"; 
		now the hash code of the item is letter-hash of T.
		
To reset hash code of (item - a thing):
	let T be indexed text;
		let T be "[item]"; 
		now the hash code of the item is letter-hash of T.
		
To say (N - number) as letter-hash:
	(- ShowLetterHash({N}); -).

To decide which number is the letter-hash of (T - indexed text):
	(- LetterHash({T}) -).

To decide which number is (X - number) with (Y - number) added:
	(- ({X} | {Y}) -).

To decide which number is (X - number) with (Y - number) removed:
	(- ({X} & (~{Y})) -).
	

To demonstrate letter-hash of (T - indexed text):
	say "The hash of <[T]> is [letter-hash of T as letter-hash].";

[When play begins:
	demonstrate letter-hash of "bed";
	demonstrate letter-hash of "bede"; 
	demonstrate letter-hash of "temptress";
	demonstrate letter-hash of "empress";
	let t be the letter-hash of "temptress";
	let r be the letter-hash of "t";
	say "temptress with t removed: [t with r removed as letter-hash]."; ]

Chapter 1 - The Letter-Remover

Section 1 - Normal Behavior

Definition: a thing is irretrievable:
	if it is the player:
		no;
	if it encloses the player:
		no; [because we've got a different disaster lined up to deal with this.]
	if it is the letter-remover:
		yes;
	if it is the tub:
		yes;
	if it encloses the letter-remover:
		yes;
	if it encloses the tub:
		yes;
	no.

Check waving the letter-remover at something irretrievable:
	if the second noun contains the tub:
		try taking the tub;
	if the second noun contains the letter-remover:
		try taking the letter-remover;
	if the second noun is irretrievable:
		say "Since [the second noun] contain[s] [if the second noun encloses the tub][the tub][otherwise]something useful[end if], it might be a bad idea to change its form. [You] might not be able to get the contents back." instead.
		
Instead of waving the letter-remover device:
	say "Whoa, whoa! Just waving that thing around without an exact aim could do a lot of damage. Wave it AT something, or don't wave it at all."

The letter-remover device is a thing. It is essential. Understand "letter remover" or "plastic device" or "device" or "blunt-nosed" as letter-remover.
	The description of the letter-remover device is "It is a blunt-nosed plastic device, about the size of a laser pointer, that can be waved at things to remove excess [current setting in upper case]s. It is not very powerful, and often fails against large items. On the other hand, it has a wide range of action: it can be set to any letter [you] choose." 
	The introduction is "These are, if not exactly cheap, hardly unknown in Atlantis."
	Understand "remover" as the letter-remover device.  
	The printed name of the letter-remover device is "[current setting in upper case]-remover". The indefinite article of the letter-remover device is "your".

After printing the name of the letter-remover device while taking inventory:
	if the letter-remover device is upgraded:
		if the letter-remover device is creature-enabled:
			say " (upgraded to handle animates and abstracts)";
		otherwise:
			say " (upgraded to handle abstracts)";
	otherwise if the letter-remover device is creature-enabled:
		say " (upgraded to handle animates)".

The letter-remover device has some indexed text called current setting. The current setting of the letter-remover device is "r". 

To say a-an (item - letter-remover device):
	if the current setting of the letter-remover device is listed in the vowel-starting list: 
		say "an";
	otherwise:
		say "a";
	say " [letter-remover device]";

The vowel-starting list is a list of indexed texts that varies. The vowel-starting list is { "a", "e", "f", "h", "i", "l", "m", "n", "o", "r", "s", "x" }. 
 
A small knob is part of the letter-remover device. Understand "dial" as the small knob when the lock is not visible. The description is "It is very delicately made and stamped with letters around the circumference. The currently up-facing letter is [the current setting of the letter-remover device]."

After printing the name of the small knob:
	say " on your [letter-remover]".

Before doing something to the small knob:
	change the noun to the letter-remover device;
	try the current action instead.

Understand "[letter-remover] [something]" as waving it at.

After reading a command:
	say "[run paragraph on]";
	let N be indexed text;
	let N be the player's command;
	replace the regular expression " [current setting of the letter-remover]-remover" in N with " letter-remover";
	change the text of the player's command to N;
	say "[run paragraph on]";
	
After reading a command when the player can touch the letter-remover:  
	let N be indexed text;
	let N be the player's command;
	if N matches the regular expression ".-remover":
		if N matches the regular expression "(.*) (.)-remover (.)*":
			replace the regular expression "(.*) (.)-remover (.)*" in N with "\2";
		otherwise if N matches the regular expression "(.*) (.)-remover":
			replace the regular expression "(.*) (.)-remover" in N with "\2";
		otherwise:
			replace the regular expression "(.)-remover.*" in N with "\1";
		if the current setting of the letter-remover exactly matches the text "[N]":
			make no decision;
		if the number of characters in N is greater than 1:
			make no decision;
		change N to "[N in lower case]";
		unless N matches the regular expression "\l":
			say "Only the 26 letters of the English alphabet are available to the letter-remover.";
			reject the player's command;
		change the current setting of the letter-remover to "[N]";
		now the letter-remover is changing;
	otherwise:
		say "[run paragraph on]"; 
		

		
The letter-remover can be static or changing. The letter-remover is static.
	
Sanity-check doing something when the noun is the letter-remover and the letter-remover is changing:
	now the letter-remover is static;
	if the player does not carry the letter-remover:
		silently try taking the letter-remover;
		if the player does not carry the letter-remover:
			stop the action;
	say "[one of][You] smoothly, and almost without thinking about it, reset your device to be [a-an letter-remover][or][You] run our thumb over the dial, setting the device to [a-an letter-remover][or][You] reset the device to [current setting of letter-remover][stopping]. [run paragraph on]";	

Understand "set [something]" as vaguely setting. Vaguely setting is an action applying to one thing.

Check vaguely setting:
	say "That is insufficiently exact [--] [you][']d have to set [the noun] to something." instead.

Instead of vaguely setting the letter-remover:
	say "You have to set it to a specific letter, as in SET [letter-remover] TO X."

Understand "set [letter-remover device] to [text]" or "tune [letter-remover device] to [text]" or  "turn [letter-remover device] to [text]" as tuning it to.  [Understand "set [something] to [text]" as tuning it to.] Tuning it to is an action applying to one carried thing and one topic. 

Check tuning it to:
	if the noun is not the letter-remover device, say "[The noun] cannot be tuned." instead.
	
Check tuning it to:
	let N be indexed text;
	let N be the topic understood; 
	if the number of characters in N is greater than 1:
		say "[You] can only tune the letter-remover device to one letter at a time." instead;
	change N to "[N in lower case]";
	unless N matches the regular expression "\l":
		say "Only the 26 letters of the English alphabet are available to the letter-remover." instead.

Carry out tuning it to:
	change the current setting of the letter-remover device to the topic understood.
	
Report tuning it to:
	say "You flick our thumb over the small knob: [you] now have [a-an letter-remover device]."
	
Report tuning the letter-remover to something for the third time:
	say "[first custom style][bracket]You can also tune the device just by using another name for it: referring to the device as, for instance, an N-remover will automatically set it to n.[close bracket][roman type][paragraph break]"
	

 
Understand "remove [text] from [something]" or "letter-remove [text] from [something]" as letter-removing it from. Letter-removing it from is an action applying to one topic and one thing.

Carry out letter-removing the topic understood from something:
	try tuning the letter-remover to the topic understood;
	try waving the letter-remover at the second noun.

Understand "wave [something preferably held] at/toward/over/around/on/across [something]" as waving it at. Waving it at is an action applying to one carried thing and one visible thing.

Understand "use [letter-remover] on [something]" as waving it at. Understand "point [letter-remover] at [something]" as waving it at.

Understand "wave [something preferably held] at/toward/over/around [any locally-present room]" as waving it at.

Understand "use [letter-remover] on [any locally-present room]" as waving it at. Understand "point [letter-remover] at [any locally-present room]" as waving it at.

Check waving something at something:
	if the noun is not a letter-remover device, 
		say "Nothing interesting happens." instead.

Check waving something at a room:
	if the noun is not a letter-remover device, 
		say "Nothing interesting happens." instead;
	say "If we were to succeed in transforming the entire room — mercifully, that's unlikely, given the power requirements — but if we did succeed, you and I would be rendered inanimate, along with any other hapless passers-by." instead.
	
Check waving the letter-remover device at the letter-remover device:
	say "This is physically impossible as well as pointless." instead. 
	
	
[Check waving the letter-remover device at something which encloses the player:
	say "A safety override prevents [the letter-remover] from working on objects which actually contain the operator at the time."]


The letter-remover device can be upgraded. The letter-remover device is not upgraded.
The letter-remover device can be creature-enabled. The letter-remover device is not creature-enabled.	

The waving it at action has an object called the generated object (matched as "creating"). 
The waving it at action has a truth state called the letter absence.
 

Setting action variables for waving the letter-remover device at an object which is not the letter-remover device:
	if the second noun is a direction:
		make no decision;
	change the letter absence to false;
	let Y be the letter-hash of the current setting;
	let comparison number be the hash code of the second noun with Y removed;
	if comparison number is the hash code of the second noun:
		now letter absence is true;
	otherwise:
		let starting text be indexed text;
		let starting text be "[printed name of the second noun]";
		let starting text be "[starting text in lower case]";  
		replace the regular expression "[current setting]" in the starting text with "";  
		change generated object to the letter-remover device;
		repeat with item running through things in repository: 
			if comparison number is the hash code of the item:
				let goal text be indexed text;
				let goal text be "[printed name of the item]";  
				let goal text be "[goal text in lower case]";
				if the goal text is the starting text:
					change the generated object to the item;
					break;
		if the generated object is the letter-remover device:
			change the disappointment text to the starting text.
							
The disappointment text is some indexed text that varies.

[Check waving the letter-remover at a foreign-tongued thing:
	say "[The letter-remover] squeaks as though frightened[one of]. Apparently encountering objects that aren't in English generates its own alarm tone[or] by the foreign-language [second noun][stopping]." instead. ]

Check waving the letter-remover at a direction:
	say "'[The second noun]' is a concept, not a concrete thing, and it eludes letter-removers." instead.
			
Check waving the letter-remover at something:
	if the letter absence is true:
		say "The letter-remover finds no [current setting of the letter-remover] in [the second noun]." instead.
		
Check waving the letter-remover at something which is enclosed by the player:
	if the player wears the second noun:
		try taking off the second noun;
		if the player does not carry the second noun:
			say "Altering one's clothes while they're on can have some unfortunate side effects." instead;
	if the player does not carry the second noun:
		try taking the second noun;
		if the player does not carry the second noun:
			let enclosure be the holder of the second noun;
			say "It isn't a good idea to change objects while they're [if the enclosure is a container]in[otherwise]on[end if] [the enclosure]." instead.

Check waving the letter-remover at something creating the letter-remover:
	if the disappointment text matches the regular expression ".*\s.*":
		let presumed second noun be indexed text;
		let presumed second noun be "[second noun]";
		let C be the number of words in presumed second noun;
		let presumed second noun be "[word number C in presumed second noun]";
		change the prior named noun to the second noun;
		say "The device buzzes, puzzled. It has tried to create a '[disappointment text]': evidently '[presumed second noun]' [is-are] too tightly bound to [its-their] modifiers and can't be manipulated separately[one of]. This is a serious problem in my field of study, incidentally[or][stopping][if the second noun is fixed in place or the second noun is scenery]. Or perhaps it just doesn't have sufficient power to handle [the second noun][end if]." instead;
	otherwise:
		if disappointment text is "":
			say "The device emits a distinctive triple tone, which means that the requested action would have entirely destroyed the target object. There are safety overrides to prevent it doing such a thing." instead;
		otherwise:
			say "The device buzzes, puzzled. It is unable to create anything recognizable called '[disappointment text]'[if the second noun is fixed in place or the second noun is scenery], or perhaps it just doesn't have sufficient power to handle [the second noun][end if]." instead.
	
Check waving the letter-remover at something creating a crude thing:
	say "A safety override mechanism kicks into play before the operation is complete; the device plays a short snickering noise. Evidently its one joy in life is detecting and foiling practical jokes." instead; 
	
Check waving the letter-remover at something creating a person when the letter-remover device is not creature-enabled:
	say "[The second noun] flickers and there is a brief image of [a generated object] in [its-their of the second noun] place, but a legal override kicks in: [a-an letter-remover] is hardware-crippled to prevent generating any living creature." instead;
	
Check waving the letter-remover at something creating an r-abstract thing when the letter-remover device is not upgraded:
	say "[The second noun] flickers and there is a brief image of [a generated object] in [its-their of the second noun] place [--] the concept strangely embodied in a physical form [--] before the power gives out[one of]. I guess your device there just isn't tuned to reify abstracts[stopping]." instead; 

Check waving the letter-remover device at something (this is the checking for danger rule):
	abide by the dangerous destruction rules for the second noun;
	[abide by the dangerous construction rules for the generated object.]
	
Check waving the letter-remover at a room creating the letter-remover:
	say "[The letter-remover] is powerless to make [the second noun] into anything called '[disappointment text]', but perhaps this is to be expected considering the size of the target. The device is after all a mere portable device with limited resources."
		
Check waving the letter-remover at a room creating something which is not the letter-remover: 
	abide by the dangerous destruction rules for the second noun;
	[abide by the dangerous construction rules for the generated object.]
		
Carry out waving the letter-remover device at something:
	move the generated object to the holder of the second noun;
	if the second noun is part of the holder of the second noun:
		now the generated object is in the location;
	move the second noun to the repository;  
	if the generated object proffers the second noun and the generated object is not original: [we've managed to create a loop in the generation, as in lee+ass, leases, lass, ass]
		now every thing which proffers the second noun proffers the generated object; 
		now the generated object does not proffer the generated object;
	otherwise:
		now the generated object is not proffered by anything;
		now every thing which proffers the second noun proffers the generated object; 
	if an essential thing (called source) proffers the generated object:
		now the generated object is essential; 
	[if something (called source) which encloses an essential thing proffers the generated object:
		now the generated object is essential; ]
	[so that 'take it' or whatever will work, after we've made something: ]
	have the parser notice the generated object;
	record "using the letter-remover" as achieved;
	let current be the current setting of the letter-remover;
	remove current from the list of remaining letters, if present;
	if the number of entries in the list of remaining letters is 0:
		record "Admiral Thoureaux award for removing every letter of the alphabet in one playthrough" as an achievement;
	[add the current setting of the letter-remover to the list of removed letters, if absent. ] 
	
The list of remaining letters is a list of indexed text that varies. The list of remaining letters is { "a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i", "j", "k", "l", "m", "n", "o", "p", "q", "r", "s", "t", "u", "v", "w", "x", "y", "z"}.

Chapter 2 - The Homonym Paddle

[The original homonym paddle is never wielded by the player; access to it is entirely controlled via requests to the bartender at the Fleur d'Or drinks club. This is only partly to limit the player's options. It's also, narratively, to establish the restricted nature of powerful letter tools, and to create occasions for more engagement with other characters (since a lot of this sequence involves essentially secret manipulations of the synthesizer in the seminar room).

We do write a few of the routines to be more general-purpose, however, because a homonym function also becomes available in the workshop during the very end of the game.]

The homonym paddle is carried by the bartender. The description is "Who had the idea of hitting things to make them swap with their homonyms, I couldn't guess. Nonetheless the toy [--] shaped like a ping-pong paddle and formed of coral-col[our]ed rubber [--] enjoyed a brief vogue in the 80s.

To prevent theft, the paddle is attached to the bartender's wrist by a thin steel cable and bracelet."

To homonym-paddle (N - a thing):
	move the N to the repository;
	let X be the player;
	if N is:
		-- a screwdriver:
			let X be the screwdriver-drink;
		-- a gimlet:
			let X be the gimlet-drink;
		-- a rusty nail:
			let X be the rusty-nail-drink;
	unless X is the player:
		record "getting a product of the homonym paddle" as achieved;
		move the X to the dor-bar-top;
		have the parser notice X;
		now X does not proffer X;
		now N proffers X;
		say "[one of]The bartender fishes around in the toolkit for [a N] and sets it on the bar with a flourish. [The patron] is watching this transaction in an interested way.
	
'This is good,' says the bartender, winking at us both (all?). 'You'll like this.' She raises the homonym paddle unnecessarily high in the air and smashes it down hard on [the N].

There's a crackling discharge of purple-toned lightning, and in place of [the N], a cocktail of the same name now sits on the bar. A few of the customers applaud.[or]'Right,' she says. She reaches into the toolkit for [the N]. 'This will be even better than last time,' she says. Then she tosses [the N] in the air and hits it with the paddle as though serving underhand at ping-pong. 

Incredibly, the resulting cocktail glass winds up perfectly balanced on the paddle rather than flying into the wall, which is what would happen if I tried the same thing.

She grins at us and sets the glass down neatly on the bar.[or]This time she lays the paddle down on the bar and drops [the N] onto its surface. The purple lightning-ball obscures [the N] for a moment, then recedes to reveal the cocktail.[stopping]";
	
		
To decide what thing is the homonym-match of (target - a thing):
	let old text be indexed text;
	let old text be "[target]";
	let old text be "[old text in lower case]";
	let new text be indexed text;
	repeat with item running through things in the repository:
		if the hash code of the item is the hash code of target:
			let new text be "[item]";
			let new text be "[new text in lower case]";
			if new text is old text:
				if the description of the item is not the description of the target: 
					decide on item;
	decide on player.

Chapter 3 - The T-inserter

The T-inserter machine is a fixed in place container in the Sensitive Equipment Testing Room. "At the cen[ter] of the room is a gleaming new T-inserter Machine[if something is in the machine], currently containing [a random thing in the T-inserter machine][end if][one of]. This is a state of the art device: letter removal has been well understood for decades, but insertion is much more dangerous and difficult, fraught with ambiguity[or][stopping]." The description is "Made of brushed steel, it resembles an industrial espresso machine, with a space in which to insert items. A dozen small nozzles poke into this space, and the grate beneath is ready to drain off any superfluity of T-ness. There is a tiny brass plate near the base of the machine."  

Understand "space" and "grate" and "inserter" as the machine. The carrying capacity of the T-inserter Machine is 1.

The brass plate is part of the machine. Understand "base" as the brass plate. The description is "DENTAL CONSONANTS LTD [--] ABSOLUTELY NO PALATALS OR LABIALS [--] GUARANTEED".

The small nozzles are part of the machine. Understand "jets" or "conical" or "sharp" or "tips" or "tip" or "business end" as the nozzles. The description is "They have sharp conical ends, like cake-decorating tips. If [you] look closely, [you] see that the business end of each is cut out in a t-shape, each in a different font." Instead of doing something other than examining to the nozzles: say "Better leave repairs to a qualified professional."

Sanity-check inserting something irretrievable into the T-inserter: 
	if the noun contains the tub:
		try taking the tub;
	if the noun contains the letter-remover:
		try taking the letter-remover;
	if the noun is irretrievable:
		say "Since [the noun] contain[s] [if the noun encloses the tub][the tub][otherwise]something useful[end if], it might be a bad idea to change its form. [You] might not be able to get the contents back." instead.

After inserting something into the T-inserter:
	try teeing the noun.

teeing is an action applying to one thing. The teeing action has an object called the goal-object (matched as "to"). The teeing action has a number called the t-count. The teeing action has a list of objects called the possible-goals. The teeing action has a list of indexed texts called the possible-goal-texts.

[We can't guess where to stick our ts in order to arrive at other objects. And because the starting object might already contain one or more instances of T, we can't just strip the Ts from our goal objects and see if they match. What we have to do instead is go through the name of all our target objects, subtract the name of the starting object, and see if all that is left is a string of ts. This gives us an opportunity to do some detailed work with individual characters:]

Setting action variables for teeing something:
	let starting text be indexed text;
	let starting text be "[printed name of the noun]"; 
	let Y be the letter-hash of "t";
	let comparison number be the hash code of the noun with Y added;
	repeat with item running through things in repository:
		if the comparison number is the hash code of the item:
			let the goal text be the name of the item minus the name of the noun;
			let matching success be true;
			if the goal text is "0", let matching success be false;
			let X be the number of times the goal text matches the regular expression "<tT>"; 
			[say "[item]: [goal text] (success [matching success])[line break]";]
			if the matching success is true and goal text exactly matches the regular expression	 "<tT>+":
				let name text be indexed text;
				let name text be "[item]";
				unless name text is listed in possible-goal-texts:
					if the goal-object is multiply-made or the goal-object is nothing:
						change the goal-object to the item;
						change the t-count to X;
					add item to the possible-goals, if absent;
					add name text to possible-goal-texts;
		
To decide what indexed text is the name of (Y - an object) minus the name of (X - an object):
	let starting text be indexed text;
	let starting text be "[X]"; 
	let starting text be "[starting text in lower case]";
	let goal text be indexed text;
	let goal text be "[Y]";
	let goal text be "[goal text in lower case]";
	let character count be the number of characters in the goal text; 
	let matching success be true;
	let next be 1;
	let max be the number of characters in the starting text plus one;
	repeat with i running from 1 to character count:
		if next is less than max:
			if character number i in the goal text is character number next in the starting text:
				replace character number i in the goal text with "-";
				increase next by 1; 
	if next is less than max: 
		change matching success to false;
	replace the regular expression "\p*" in the goal text with ""; [we strip out the replaced bits]
	[say "found: [goal text]";]
	if matching success is true, decide on the goal text;
	otherwise decide on "0";
		
Check teeing something:
	if the goal-object is nothing, 
		say "The T-inserter machine whirs to life, then gives a disappointed sort of whuff when it finds no good place for t-insertion." instead.

Check teeing something:
	abide by the dangerous destruction rules for the noun;
	abide by the dangerous construction rules for the goal-object.
	

Carry out teeing something:
	now the goal-object is not proffered by anything;
	if the goal-object is r-abstract:
		complete "Test T-inserter on making abstracts";
	if the goal-object is a person:
		complete "Test T-inserter on making creatures";
	if the number of entries in the possible-goals is greater than 1:
		now the goal-object is multiply-made;
	now every thing which proffers the noun proffers the goal-object;
	move the goal-object to the holder of the noun;
	record "using the T-inserter" as achieved;
	move the noun to the repository.  
	
A thing can be multiply-made. A thing is usually not multiply-made.
	
After teeing something:
	if the number of entries in the possible-goals is greater than 1:
		repeat with item running through possible-goals:
			if item is not the goal-object and item is not multiply-made:
				continue the action;
	otherwise:
		continue the action;
	let N be the number of entries in the possible-goals;
	say "[if t-count is 1]There is a loud and satisfying pop[otherwise]There are [t-count in words] small pops[end if] from the machine as it turns [the noun] into [a goal-object]. ";
	say "There now: the T-inserter has constructed [if N is 2]both[otherwise]all of[end if] [possible-goals]. Not very stable, it seems. Slango will be interested to know that."; 
	complete "Test T-inserter on situations where it could build more than one thing";
	abide by the dangerous construction rules for the goal-object;
	have the parser notice the goal-object;
	try examining the goal-object instead.

Report teeing something:
	say "[if t-count is 1]There is a loud and satisfying pop[otherwise]There are [t-count in words] small pops[end if] from the machine as it turns [the noun] into [a goal-object].";
	if the number of entries in the possible-goals is greater than 1:
		let N be the number of entries in the possible-goals;
		say "[line break]Of course, there were other options there: the T-inserter could have made [N in words] words. But it seems to be disambiguating to [the goal-object]. The question now is whether it would do so consistently or whether its behavi[our] is underdetermined; [you] don't have time for a really thorough trial set, but checking a couple more times may be indicative.";
	abide by the dangerous construction rules for the goal-object;
	have the parser notice the goal-object;
	try examining the goal-object instead.
	
Test it-construction with "autoupgrade / wave a-remover at pita / wave p-remover at pit / wave t-remover at it / put i in t-inserter / get it / wave t-remover at it / put i in t-inserter" holding the pita in the Sensitive Equipment Testing Room.

Chapter 4 - The Synthesizer

The plexiglas case is a thing in the Language Studies Seminar Room. It is transparent, closed, openable, lockable, and locked. It is fixed in place. "A massive plexiglas case takes up one corner of the room." The description is "The case is made of very thick protective plastic on a metal frame[if the screws are part of the plexiglas case and the plexiglas case is lockable]. It is thoroughly locked shut; I don't think [you][']ll have any luck with normal forms of approach. However, plexiglas is a cuttable substance with the right tools, and then there are the screws at the back[otherwise if the plexiglas case is not lockable]. The lid has been compromised by a saw, and the case is now permanenty open[end if]." 

Test plexibug with "tutorial off / get plexiglas" in the Language Studies Seminar Room.

A description-concealing rule when the crossword is marked for listing:
	if the crossword is in the synthesizer and the plexiglas case is closed:
		now the crossword is not marked for listing.

Rule for printing the name of the synthesizer when writing a paragraph about something:
	say "compact but high-powered late model synthes[ize]r".

Some screws are part of the plexiglas case. 

[We would also have to make a rule preventing the player from cutting the plexiglas with the sword, except that the sword only exists after the plexiglas is opened.]

Sanity-check opening or closing the plexiglas when the plexiglas is not openable:
	say "Thanks to our earlier efforts, the plexiglas is now open permanently." instead.

Test plexiglas with "tutorial off / cut plexiglas / cut plexiglas with jigsaw / g / cut plexiglas with sword / drop sword / cut plexiglas / close plexiglas" in the Seminar Room holding the jigsaw and the sword.

Sanity-check cutting the plexiglas with something:

		say "I think [you] have done enough damage here." instead;
	else if the plexiglas is unlocked:

The screwdriver unlocks the plexiglas case.

Some screws are a thing. The screws are plural-named. The description of the screws is "Heavy-duty flathead screws, each about an inch long[if the screws are part of the plexiglas case and the plexiglas case is lockable]. They aren't sealed over, so it would be possible to unscrew them, given a screwdriver[end if]."

Carry out unlocking the plexiglas case with the screwdriver:
	move the screws to the location.
	
Instead of unlocking the plexiglas case with the screwdriver for the first time:
	say "[You] squeeze ourselves against the wall and angle to reach the screws with the screwdriver. I start on the first screw when[--]

The synthesizer is a container in the plexiglas case. The heft of the synthesizer is 4. The synthesizer is fixed in place. Understand "synth"  or "synthesiser" as the synthesizer.
	The description is "It is designed to accept two items and then be turned on. It is shiny and white, and looks a little like a bathtub for very short people."
	The introduction is "It was a full-sized, human version of this that made us what [you] [are] now, so the object makes both of us feel a little skittish and self-conscious."

Instead of switching on the synthesizer when the synthesizer contains the roll and the synthesizer contains the rock:

Chapter 5 - The Spinner

Section 1 - Physical Description

[ The function of the spinner is to reverse a word and produce the result, assuming that anything does result: YAM / MAY, DOG / GOD, EEL / LEE, LEER / REEL, PANS / SNAP, PIT / TIP, SAP / PAS are all creatable using the spinner. Accordingly, the items it produces are a strict subset of the items that can be created using the anagramming gun; besides that, it's not portable and doesn't fire at a distance, so it has some other restrictions as well. This makes it more of a toy than most of the other letter devices to be found in the game.

The spinner belongs to a very early stage of the game's development. Originally the plan was to have the spinner as a decoration in the Fleur d'Or, and the player would need to distract the staff there in order to gain access to it and use it. (There was also a turntable that would move one letter from the front to the back or back to front, as in APE > PEA or ARC > CAR.) 

In practice, however, the small number of possibilities associated with these tools didn't yield very many interesting puzzles, so the spinner was commented out for most of the game's development period.

It owes its reappearance in the game to the LEER/REEL easter egg. While it would have been possible to arrange this easter egg in the Bureau, using the anagramming gun to complete the change (and indeed it was initially implemented that way), it felt odd to have a projector in the Bureau but not one in the cinema. In particular, I was concerned that creating an achievement such as Projectionist would feel misleading and annoying to many players if the projector in question were concealed inside the Bureau rather than being in the obvious place for a projector to be.

So the projection booth was added to the cinema and the spinner reintroduced to make it possible to create the reel before the anagramming gun was rediscovered. (By the time the player gets the anagramming gun, it is impossible to reach the cinema again.) 

That in turn necessitated other changes as follow: 

-- placing another object in the projection booth to make it seem other than wholly pointless when the player first finds it; so the jotter is moved there from the crate in the crawlspace and the notes on the jotter are changed;
-- creating an initial object to sit on the spinner to demonstrate its functionality, which was going to be a figurine of a god/dog; this was a very oblique reference to Apollo Agyieus, a guardian of doorways traditionally worshipped in aniconic form as a conical pillar garlanded with flowers. Both the god and the dog are guardian figures. 
-- removing some other distracting text from Roget Close so that the spinner is allowed to stand out more;
-- coming up with more immediate functionality for the spinner so that it won't seem such a red herring

...and at this point I decided to convert the spinner into a proper puzzle of its own, one in which the gate unlocks only if you give the spinner something that it can convert. So at that point the god/dog had to be removed to let the player solve this herself; so I buried the dog in Monument Green and associated a different achievement with finding it.

This is all a lot of bother just for the sake of adding an achievement/easter egg that most players probably won't notice. In each case, though, I felt as though the result of the design fix was a richer, more interesting setting with more playful manipulation available. Adding the yam to the game also provided another purpose for the farmer, who had been relatively useless (other than as the provider of the totally optional lime) ever since he stopped selling chard.  ]

The spinner is part of the spinner-gate. It is a supporter. Understand "sculpture" or "mirror" or "statue" or "pedestal" or "cone" as the spinner. 
	The description of the spinner is "The base of the sculpture is a cone about four feet tall. On top of that is a flat circular pedestal, and there is a mirror that rotates around the outer circumference. The mirrored surface faces inward, so that it is sometimes reflecting [if something is on the spinner][the random thing on the spinner] on the pedestal[otherwise]whatever might be on the pedestal (currently nothing)[end if] and sometimes concealing [if something is on the spinner][it-them][otherwise]it[end if] from view.". 
	The printed name of the spinner is "pedestal". 
	The carrying capacity is 1.  
	
Sanity-check switching on the spinner:
	say "The sculpture appears to be permanently on." instead.
	
Sanity-check switching off the spinner:
	say "If there is an off-switch, it's nowhere we can see it." instead.



Section 2 - Spinning Functionality
	
Every turn when the location is Roget Close and something is on the spinner: 
	if not looking:
		follow the spinner-turning rule;
		say paragraph break.
	
This is the spinner-turning rule:
	let the chosen article be a random thing on the spinner;

	let goal text be "[printed name of the X]";
	change goal text to "[goal text in lower case]";

	repeat with Z running from 1 to max characters:
		change substitute text to "[character number Z in goal text][substitute text]";  
	change goal text to substitute text;
[	say "[substitute text]";]
	[since the spinner's likely to be undoing its own work, allow it to get the original back.]

			if the hash code of the item is the hash code of X:
				let item text be indexed text;
				now item text is "[item]";
				now item text is "[item text in lower case]";
				if the goal text is item text:
					now the chosen article is the item; 
	if the chosen article is not X:
		abide by the dangerous destruction rules for X;
		now the chosen article is not proffered by anything; 
		now everything which proffers X proffers the chosen article;
		if an essential thing (called source) proffers the chosen article:

			say " not change, however. ";
		otherwise:
			say "The mirror revolves for a moment, [one of]without effect[or]without changing [the list of things on the spinner][at random], though the word '[substitute text]' appears in startling green on the mirror's surface. ".
			
Test yambug with "tutorial off / wear monocle / buy yam / n / w / put yam on pedestal / z / x yam" holding the roll of bills and the monocle in Hesychius Street.
	
Rule for disclosing exterior of something (called special-target) which is on the spinner:
	say "[The special-target] [is-are] slowly revolving on [a spinner][if a mentionable thing is on the spinner], together with [a list of mentionable things which are on the spinner][end if]. [run paragraph on]";

Chapter 6 - The Turntable

[The turntable is a supporter. It is scenery. The carrying capacity is 1. The description is "A swiftly rotating platform able to go clockwise or anticlockwise. It is currently set to [rotation-direction]." Understand "table" or "turn table" as the turntable.

Rotation-direction is a kind of value. The rotation-directions are clockwise and anticlockwise. Understand "counterclockwise" and "widdershins" as anticlockwise. The turntable has a rotation-direction.

Understand "set [turntable] to [rotation-direction]" as setting it to the direction. Setting it to the direction is an action applying to one thing and one rotation-direction.

Instead of vaguely setting the turntable:
	if the turntable is clockwise, try setting turntable to the direction anticlockwise; otherwise try setting the turntable to the direction clockwise. 

Carry out setting it to the direction:
	now the rotation-direction of the turntable is the rotation-direction understood.
	
Report setting it to the direction:
	say "[The turntable] now goes [the rotation-direction of the turntable]."

Every turn when the turntable is visible and something is on the turntable: 
	if not looking:
		follow the turntable-turning rule;
		say paragraph break.
	
This is the turntable-turning rule:
	let the chosen article be a random thing on the turntable;
	let X be the chosen article;
	let the goal text be indexed text;
	let goal text be "[printed name of the X]";
	if the turntable is clockwise
	begin;	[put first letter at the end, as in ape --> pea]
		if the goal text matches the regular expression "(.)(.*)", replace the regular expression "(.)(.*)" in goal text with "\2\1";
	otherwise;	[put last letter at the front, as in arc --> car]

	end if;
	repeat with item running through things in the repository
	begin;

	end repeat;
	if the chosen article is not X
	begin;
		now the chosen article is not proffered by anything;
		now everything which proffers X proffers the chosen article;
		now everything which is on the turntable is in the repository;
		move the chosen article to the turntable;
		say "[if looking]After the turntable does its work,[otherwise]The turntable whirls faster than we can follow, and when it is done[end if] there [is-are a list of things on the turntable]. ";
	otherwise;
		if looking
		begin;
			if exactly one thing is on the turntable, say "It does";
			otherwise say "[The list of things on the turntable] do[es]";
			say " not change, however. ";
		otherwise; 
			say "The turntable spins for a moment, [one of]then dies down again[or]without effect[or]without changing [the list of things on the turntable][at random]. ";
		end if;
	end if.
	
Rule for disclosing exterior of something (called special-target) which is on the turntable:
	say "[The special-target] [is-are] spinning rapidly [rotation-direction of the turntable] on [a turntable][if a thing is on the turntable], together with [a list of mentionable things which are on the turntable][end if]. [run paragraph on]"; 
	follow the turntable-turning rule.

Rule for disclosing contents of the turntable (this is the turntable-content rule):	
	say "On [the turntable], [a list of things on the turntable] spin[s] [rotation-direction of the turntable]. [run paragraph on]"; 
	follow the turntable-turning rule. ]
			
Chapter 7 - Authentication Scope

An authentication scope is a kind of thing.

The secretary carries an authentication scope called the Regulation Authentication Scope.

In the backpack is an authentication scope called a monocle. The description of the monocle is "This is no mere fashion accessory. It is the very top grade of authentication scope, designed for people who have to use them all day, and normally available only to employees of the Bureau of Orthography. If [you] look through the monocle at something, [you] can see its true nature, regardless of spelling changes." The monocle is wearable. The monocle is illegal.
	The introduction of the monocle is "You like that? I thought you might be impressed. My father got it for me. 'For research,' he said, but I think he knew I just coveted them. At any rate, you're not the only one with equipment."
	The monocle is essential.
	The monocle covers the face-area.
	
Last after examining something when the player wears the monocle:
	if the noun is not the monocle:
		try looking at the noun through the monocle;
	continue the action. 
	
After wearing the monocle:
	if the player is not enclosed by the kayak:
		say "Everything turns computer-monitor green when viewed through our right eye. And staring fixedly at anything will turn up its authenticity status."
	
Understand "stare at [something]" or "stare fixedly at [something]" as examining.

The description of an Authentication Scope is usually "It looks like a small hand-held telescope, or perhaps a very posh kaleidoscope: all brown leather and brass fittings, and a good heft indicating quality materials. The sophisticated electronics are all concealed within. If [you] look through the scope at something, [you] can see its true nature, regardless of spelling changes."

Instead of searching a scope:
	try looking at a random thing in the location through the noun.

Understand "look at [something] through/with/using [something preferably held]" as looking at it through.
Understand "examine [something] with/through [something preferably held]" as looking at it through.
Understand "look through/with/using [something preferably held] at [something]" as looking at it through (with nouns reversed).

Looking at it through is an action applying to one visible thing and one carried thing.

Check an actor looking at something through something:
	if the second noun is not an Authentication Scope
	begin;
		if the actor is the player, say "[The second noun] won't give us a clear view of [the noun]." instead;
		stop the action;
	end if.

Check an actor looking at something through something:
	if the noun is an authentication Scope and the second noun is the noun
	begin;
		if the actor is the player, say "[You] can't look through [the noun] at itself." instead;
		stop the action;
	end if.

Check an actor looking at something through something:
	if the noun is the actor
	begin;
		if the actor is the player, say "[You] can't turn the scope on ourselves [--] which might be just as well, really, because I think it would give me a headache to see the two of us conjoined at the hip. Or however the scope would show us, anyway." instead;
		stop the action;
	end if.
	
Carry out looking at a mirror through something:
	say "[The noun] [is-are] real enough, and [the second noun] pings approvingly.
	
But laid over the reflection we can see the two of us as we used to look: you a little shorter than our current body, me taller and male and needing a shave. I'm not sure whether it makes me feel better or worse to see us like that." instead.

Test reflecting-bug with "x reflection / wear monocle / x reflection / look at reflection through monocle" holding the monocle in sigil street.
	
Carry out looking at it through:
	if the noun is original or the noun is disguised:
		[play the sound of scope success;]
		say "[The second noun] pings happily as [you] sight [the noun] with the crosshairs.";
	otherwise:
		[play the sound of scope failure;]
		say "There is a dismissive blatt from [the second noun], and transposed over [the noun] is a faint, [if the noun is edible and the noun is proffered by something inedible]unappet[izing][otherwise]greenish[end if] image of [a list of things which proffer the noun]."
	
Report someone looking at something through something:
	if the noun is original, say "In response [the actor] looks through [the second noun] at [the noun], then nods briskly. '[one of]The genuine article[or]Definitely not fake[or]Looks clean[or]Not a forgery[or]Real[or]Yup, authentic[at random].'";
	otherwise say "Thoughtfully [the actor] peers through [the second noun] at [the noun], then frowns. '[one of]Fake[or]An obvious forgery[or]Not at all the real thing[or]Bogus[or]I hope that came with a money-back guarantee[as decreasingly likely outcomes]!' [it-they of the actor] [one of]say[s][or]remark[s][or]exclaim[s][as decreasingly likely outcomes]." 
	

	
After the secretary looking at the disguised pass through a scope:
	say "The secretary raises her Authentication Scope to look at the pass. There is a moment of silence. The scope does nothing.";
	now the player is allowed.

After the secretary looking at the undisguised pass through a scope:
	say "The secretary raises the scope to look at the pass. Her eyes widen at the blatant forgery. 'Stay right there, buddy,' she says. From her tone of voice, this is obviously the most entertaining thing that has happened to her this fiscal year.
	
It is also a wholly unnecessary command, because she has pressed a button that puts the antechamber into lock-down mode.

There follows a long interrogation and a short trial.";
	end the game saying "[You] pass the rest of our days stamping lic[ense] plates together"

After someone looking at the player through an authentication Scope:
	say "[The actor] turns the Authentication Scope on us. You seem calm, but I'm nervous as hell. 
	
But I have to say, you were right: the scope neither beeps nor blatts. [The actor] tries twisting the end as though bringing a telescope into focus, but nothing changes.
	
'Must be broken,' mutters [the actor]."

First carry out looking at the inscription through an authentication scope:
	say "[The second noun] begins to whirr and whirr, as though something inside has caught in an unresolvable loop. After a very long time, it whirrs down again without any noise of rejection or acceptance." instead.

Chapter 8 - The Origin Paste

A thing can be disguised or undisguised. A thing is usually undisguised.

After someone looking at a disguised thing through the scope:
	say "[The person asked] frowns, but the scope makes no sound."
	
Instead of looking at a disguised thing through the scope:
	say "[The scope] fails to make any sound or response at all, but no green image forms revealing the true nature of [the noun]."
	
The player is disguised.

The Origin Paste is a disguised illegal thing on the bar-top. The origin paste is essential. The indefinite article is "some".

The origin paste can be won or unwon. The origin paste is unwon.

Instead of taking the Origin Paste when the Origin Paste is unwon:
	say "Without even glancing away from what he's doing, Parker the barman says, 'That's reserved.'"


The description of the Origin Paste is "A cake of pale purple: it is able to disguise letter-reformed objects so that they don't look like obvious frauds, or even show up under authentication. 

The only problem with it is the distinctive smell." 
	The introduction is "The Origin Paste is powerful stuff, and worth a good bit of money."
	The scent-description is "overpowering French lavender".
	
Instead of eating or tasting the paste:
	say "[one of]I once tried some lavender sorbet at a swank little Milanese gelato shop. This is like that, only less icy and more chalky.[or]Sorry, it's not an experience I care to repeat.[stopping]".
	
Instead of smelling the player:
	say "[You] smell of lavender. It's not as bad a reek as it was earlier, though. No one would think it was anything but soap."


Understand "rub [paste] on/onto/to [something]" as putting it on. 

Sanity-check putting the origin paste on the restoration gel:
	try putting the restoration gel on the origin paste instead.
	

Sanity-check putting the origin paste on the tub:
	try putting the restoration gel on the origin paste instead.

Instead of putting the paste on something:
	record "using the origin paste" as achieved;
	say "[You] [if a person who is not the player is visible]surreptitiously [end if]smear some of [the paste] onto [the second noun]. Nothing obvious happens, of course, but that is the whole point.";
	now the second noun is disguised.
	
Instead of smelling a disguised thing:
	say "Lavender wafts back at us."
	
The ash is disguised.
	
Test originpaste with "tutorial off / x paste / eat paste / smell paste / smell me / touch paste / lick paste / put paste on me / put paste on gel / open tub / put paste on gel / gel paste / rub paste on me / rub paste onto me / rub paste onto remover / smell remover / drop paste / get paste" holding the origin paste and the tub.
	
Chapter 9 - The Restoration Gel

Section 1 - Gel and the Rest of the World

Understand "gel" or "restoration gel" as the tub when the tub is closed. The scent-description of the restoration gel is "spearmint".

Sanity-check waving the restoration gel: 
	try waving the holder of the restoration gel instead.

Sanity-check taking the restoration gel:
	try taking the holder of the restoration gel instead.

Instead of tasting or eating the restoration gel:
	say "While it may look like toothpaste and smell like toothpaste, it actually is not toothpaste."
	
Test gel-behavior with "open tub / open backpack / put gel in backpack" holding the tub and the backpack.
	

Procedural rule when tasting or eating the restoration gel:
	ignore the carrying requirements rule.
	
A description-concealing rule when the location is Open Sea:
	now the restoration gel is not marked for listing. [Otherwise, even though the tub is mentioned elsewhere in the description, the restoration gel shows up in a disruptive line of text in the middle of the room description.]

After printing the name of the tub while looking:
	say " of [restoration gel]";
	omit contents in listing.

Test tube-bug with "tutorial off / wear monocle / x tub" holding the monocle and the tub.

First carry out looking at the tub through an authentication scope:
	say "[The second noun] shows the residual form of the tube." instead.

Section 2 - Converting nouns

Understand "rub [gel] on/onto/to [something]" as putting it on. Understand "rub [tube] on/onto/to [something]" as putting it on. Understand the commands "smear" as "rub".

Understand "apply [gel] on/onto/to [something]" as putting it on. Understand "apply [tube] on/onto/to [something]" as putting it on.

Understand "use [gel] on [something]" as putting it on. Understand "use [tube] on [something]" as putting it on.

Understand "[gel] [something]" or "[tube] [something]" as putting it on.

Understand "[paste] [something]" as putting it on.

Sanity-check putting the tube on something:
	say "Unfortunately, there's hardly any gel remaining in the tube." instead.

Sanity-check putting the restoration gel on something irretrievable: 
	if the second noun contains the tub:
		try taking the tub;
	if the second noun contains the letter-remover:
		try taking the letter-remover;
	if the second noun is irretrievable:
		say "Since [the second noun] contain[s] [if the second noun encloses the tub][the tub][otherwise]something useful[end if], it might be a bad idea to change its form. [You] might not be able to get the contents back." instead.

[Because it's possible to change something into an object that becomes fixed in place in the backpack, or too heavy to move...]

Before putting the restoration gel on something which is in the backpack:
	try taking the second noun;
	if the player does not carry the second noun:
		say "It seems best not to word-change things that are in the backpack." instead.

[And now special cases of description: ]

Instead of putting the restoration gel on the Origin Paste:
	say "[You] dip out some of the gel and touch it to the Origin Paste. There is a violent, fizzy reaction; lavender and mint fumes; and then the two substances appear to have worked out their mutual antipathy. The dollop of gel is gone, the cake of paste slightly smaller than it used to be."

Instead of putting the restoration gel on something:
	say "[You] dip out [if the heft of the second noun is 1]fingertip-coating[otherwise]pea-sized[end if] quantity of gel and rub it gently onto [the second noun]. [run paragraph on]";
	gel-convert second noun.
	
Instead of putting the restoration gel on something fluid:
	say "[You] just touch a coated fingertip of gel to [the second noun]. [run paragraph on]";
	gel-convert second noun.
	
Instead of putting the restoration gel on yourself:
	if atlantida-woman is seen:
		say "[You] optimistically rub in a little gel, but it doesn't make any difference. We're stuck this way, for good.";
	else:
		say "A fingertip-dab isn't enough to undo the doubling-up [you] experienced, but if [you] applied more, there's a real chance [you][']d come apart into a you and a me. And [you] can't afford that right now."
	
Yourself can be gelled or ungelled. Yourself is ungelled.

Instead of wearing the restoration gel:
	try putting the restoration gel on yourself.

[Instead of putting the restoration gel on yourself during Nightfalling:
	if the location encloses someone who is not the player:
		say "[You][']d rather do this where we have some privacy, just in case the splitting is embarrassing or leaves us both nude or something." instead;
	if Brock is in the repository:
		say "Let's gel Brock first and make sure he's all right; then [you] can use the rest of the gel with impunity, however much [you] need." instead;
	if the player is ungelled:
		now the player is gelled;
		say "At last, time to get out of this double existence. You scoop out a big handful of the restoration gel and start applying it to both arms like you're putting on mosquito repellant for a swamp raid. 

It tingles and burns, fizzing against the existing Origin Paste that held us together this long and protected us from authentication scopes.
	
[You] dip again and slather on more: over our face, neck, hair even. [You] just about empty the whole tub.

It's cool now, not reacting against anything.

It also isn't working.

Instead of someone trying touching the restoration gel:
	if the person asked can touch the restoration gel:
		gel-convert the person asked;
		rule succeeds.

Definition: a thing (called itself) is original if it proffers itself and it is proffered by exactly one thing.

To gel-convert (item - an object):
	if the item is not original:
		abide by the dangerous destruction rules for the item; 
		let destination be home for the item;
		now everything which proffers the item is in the destination; 
		[play the sound of gel splort;]
		let description needed be false;

		say "With an audible SPLORT, [the item] become[s] [a list of things which proffer the item][if the destination is the location and the holder of the item is not the location] and falls to the ground[end if]. ";
		if description needed is true:

		say "[one of][paragraph break]I'm starting to understand how you got into all the places you got into. Not that I judge you or your line of work, of course. [or][stopping][paragraph break]";
		record "using the gel" as achieved;
		[It's possible, in rare cases, for something to be its own parent: AS+COT -> SCOT -> COT leaves a result that is one of its own earlier ingredients. So we need to account for that: ]
		if the item does not proffer the item: 
			move the item to the repository;
	otherwise:
		say "Alas, nothing happens.".

To decide what object is home for (item - a thing):
	let destination be the holder of the item;
	if the item is part of the destination:
		let the destination be the location;
	decide on destination.
		
Instead of putting the restoration gel on a naughty-sounding thing:
	say "[You] squeeze out a pea-sized quantity of gel and rub it gently onto [--] 

No, let me rephrase. [You] clinically and distantly apply some of the restoration gel to an innocent portion of the object in question. [run paragraph on]";
	gel-convert the second noun.

Chapter 10 - The Anagramming Gun

Section 1 - Pistols and Shooting

[This is lightly adapted from the Technological Terror example in the manual. SHOOT is an annoying verb because there are several different equally valid syntaxes in English and we want to account for all of them, and make good guesses if the player types just SHOOT TARGET or SHOOT WITH GUN.]

A pistol is a kind of thing. A pistol can be loaded or unloaded. A pistol is usually loaded.

Definition: a thing is ungunlike if it is not a pistol.

Shooting it with is an action applying to one visible thing and one carried thing. The shooting it with action has an object called the detritus.

Check shooting something with something which is not a pistol:
	say "[You] are insufficiently armed." instead. 
	
Check shooting something with an unloaded pistol:
	say "[The second noun] [is-are] not loaded." instead.

Check shooting a pistol with the noun:
	say "[The noun] doesn't bend that way." instead; 
	 
Does the player mean shooting something which is not held by the player with something which is held by the player:
	it is very likely.


 
Understand "shoot [pistol] at [something ungunlike]" as shooting it with (with nouns reversed).

Understand "shoot [something ungunlike] with [a pistol]" as shooting it with. Understand "shoot [something] with [something]" as shooting it with.

Understand "shoot [something] at [something]" as shooting it with (with nouns reversed). 

Understand "fire [pistol] at [something ungunlike]" as shooting it with (with nouns reversed). Understand "fire at [something ungunlike] with [a pistol]" as shooting it with. Understand "fire at [something] with [something]" as shooting it with. 

Section 2 - Anagramming Gun

The anagramming gun is an unloaded pistol on the display-platform. Understand "anagrammer" as the anagramming gun. The description is "Anagramming guns are illegal now, of course, because of their desperately unpredictable behavi[our]. This one is a huge heavy thing, though not quite an artillery piece, because of the colossal amounts of power required and all the stabil[ize]rs needed to try to collapse the letters back down to a single phrase."  

Section 3 - Loading the Gun

Sanity-check inserting the bullets into a gun:
	try loading the noun into the second noun instead.

Understand "load [something] with [something]" as loading it into (with nouns reversed).
Understand "load [something] into [something]" as loading it into.
Understand "load [anagramming gun] with [anagram bullets]" as loading it into (with nouns reversed).
Understand "load [anagram bullets] into [anagramming gun]" as loading it into.

Loading it into is an action applying to one carried thing and one thing.

Check loading something into something ungunlike:
	say "[The second noun] [is-are] not a gun." instead.
	
Check loading something which is not the anagram bullets into something:
	say "[The noun] [is-are] not ammunition." instead.

Carry out loading the anagram bullets into the anagramming gun:
	remove the anagram bullets from play;
	now the anagramming gun is loaded.
	
Report loading the anagram bullets into the anagramming gun:
	say "I would not know how to do this, but you have sufficient expert skill that we've got the gun loaded up in no time." instead.
	
Instead of searching the anagramming gun:
	if the anagramming gun is loaded:
		say "There are still some more anagramming bullets within.";
	otherwise:
		say "The gun is unloaded."
		
Understand "unload [something]" as unloading. Unloading is an action applying to one thing.

Sanity-check unloading:
	if the noun is not a pistol:
		say "[The noun] [is-are] not a gun." instead;
	if the noun is the anagramming gun and the anagramming gun is unloaded:
		say "[The anagramming gun] [is-are] already empty." instead;
	otherwise:
		say "[You] see no reason to disarm us unnecessarily." instead.


Section 4 - The Anagram Effect of Shooting


Sanity-check shooting something irretrievable with the loaded anagramming gun:
	if the second noun contains the tub:
		try taking the tub;
	if the second noun contains the letter-remover:
		try taking the letter-remover;
	if the second noun is irretrievable:
		say "Since [the second noun] contain[s] [if the second noun encloses the tub][the tub][otherwise]something useful[end if], it might be a bad idea to change its form. [You] might not be able to get the contents back." instead.
 
Sanity-check shooting the loaded anagramming gun with  the loaded anagramming gun:
	say "It is impossible to aim the gun at itself." instead.

Check shooting something with the loaded anagramming gun: 
	let initial key be the anagram key of the noun;
	now detritus is the noun;
	let the possibles list be a list of things;
	repeat with item running through things in the repository:
		if the hash code of the item is the hash code of the noun:
			[say "[item]: ";]
			let initial name be indexed text;
			let initial name be "[noun]"; 
			let initial name be "[initial name in lower case]"; 
			let comparison name be indexed text;
			let comparison name be "[item]"; 
			let comparison name be "[comparison name in lower case]"; 
			let comparison key be the anagram key of the item;
			[say "[comparison key]";
			say "[noun]: [initial key]"; ]
			if comparison key is the initial key and the initial name is not the comparison name:
				add the item to the possibles list; [* We make a list because otherwise, for any set of anagrammed objects in the repository, we will always just swap back and forth between the first two that are implemented and never get to the others.]
	let max be the number of entries in the possibles list;
	if max is 0:
		say "The gun fires ruggedly into [the noun], but is unable to make anything interesting out of [the initial key]. [The noun] recoalesce[s] into [its-their] original form." instead;
	otherwise:  
		now detritus is entry max of the possibles list. 

To decide what list of indexed text is the anagram key of (n - an object):
	let anagram key be a list of indexed text;
	let starting form be indexed text;
	let starting form be "[n]";
	let count be the number of characters in starting form;
	repeat with i running from 1 to count:
		let char be indexed text;
		let char be "[character number i in starting form]";
		let char be "[char in lower case]";
		if char is not " ":
			add char to anagram key;
	sort anagram key; 
	decide on anagram key;
	
Check shooting something with the anagramming gun:
	abide by the dangerous destruction rules for the noun.

Carry out shooting something with the anagramming gun:
	move the detritus to the holder of the noun;
	if the noun is part of the holder of the noun:
		now the detritus is in the location;
	move the noun to the repository;  
	if the detritus proffers the noun and the detritus is not original:  
		now every thing which proffers the noun proffers the detritus; 
		now the generated object does not proffer the detritus;
	otherwise:
		now the detritus is not proffered by anything;
		now every thing which proffers the noun proffers the detritus; 
	if an essential thing (called source) proffers the detritus:
		now the detritus is essential;
	[ if something (called source) which proffers the detritus encloses an essential thing:
		now the detritus is essential; ]
	record "using the anagramming gun" as achieved; 

Report shooting something with the anagramming gun when the detritus is unseen:
	say "The gun fires ruggedly into [the noun], which shatter[s] and then reform[s] as [the detritus]. [run paragraph on][detritus description][paragraph break]";
	have the parser notice the detritus;
	abide by the dangerous construction rules for the detritus instead.

Report shooting something with the anagramming gun:
	say "The gun fires ruggedly into [the noun], which shatter[s] and then reform[s] as [the detritus]."; 
	abide by the dangerous construction rules for the detritus instead.




Chapter 11 - Restoration gel rifle

The restoration-gel rifle is an essential pistol. The printed name of the restoration-gel rifle is "restoration gel rifle". Understand "restoration" or "gel" or "handgun" as the restoration-gel rifle. 

[we want use of the regular gel to win, if possible]
Does the player mean putting the restoration-gel rifle on something:
	it is unlikely.

The description of the restoration-gel rifle is "A rifle that shoots pellets of restoration gel, converting objects from a distance. Guns like this are illegal to carry unless you're Bureau. They can inflict unpleasant bruises if they encounter nothing to convert and absorb the energy."

[Disambiguate sensibly with the tub of gel.]
Does the player mean shooting something with the restoration-gel rifle:
	it is very likely.
Does the player mean doing something with the restoration-gel rifle:
	it is unlikely.

Sanity-check shooting something irretrievable with the restoration-gel rifle:
	if the second noun is the player:
		make no decision;
	say "Since [the second noun] contain[s] [if the second noun encloses the tub][the tub][otherwise]something useful[end if], it might be a bad idea to change its form. [You] might not be able to get the contents back." instead.

[Because it's possible to change something into an object that becomes fixed in place in the backpack, or too heavy to move...]

Before shooting something which is in the backpack with the restoration-gel rifle:
	try taking the noun;
	if the player does not carry the noun:
		say "It seems best not to word-change things that are in the backpack." instead.

[And now special cases of description: ]

Instead of shooting the Origin Paste with the restoration-gel rifle:
	say "[You] fire the gun into the Origin Paste. There is a violent thump, a suffocating cloud of lavender and mint fumes, and then the paste is much the same as before, just smaller."
	
Carry out shooting something with the restoration-gel rifle:
	say "[You] shoot [the restoration-gel rifle] at [the noun]. ";
	gel-convert the noun.


Chapter 12 - Britishizing Goggles

[Originally included as a joke, and a harmless one, because it was going to be in the tools exhibit and the player was never going to be able to get in there. Later, though, when I made the tool exhibit possible to break into, it became necessary to go back and implement cosmetic changes throughout the text. And then it felt like the player was getting the goggles too late in the game for them to be really fun as a toy, so I moved them much earlier, to the antiques shop.

Let this be a lesson to you, children. Jokes can cost a lot of implementation time.]

Some Britishizing goggles are a wearable thing. The description is "An experimental prototype that (from the perspective of the viewer only) adds -u- into words ending in -or, and reverses -er into -re wherever possible. Subjects wearing the [Britishizing Goggles] generally began to develop implausible accents and to have better than usual success wooing American tourists. Otherwise, the goggles are not much use: like my monocle, they don't affect the actual form of an object in any way.

The surplus stock were mostly given away as rewards to supporters of public television, and the Bureau discouraged even recreational use in the 1980s as they began to make progress towards greater linguistic purity."

[Check wearing the Britishizing goggles while the player is wearing the monocle:
	try taking off the monocle;
	if the player is wearing the monocle:
		say "[You] can't fit the goggles over the monocle." instead.

Chapter 13 - The Umlaut Punch

[Because the player shouldn't stop having fun things just because it's late in the game. The anagramming gun was a pretty ambitious thing to add and brought in a lot of extra objects, but I wanted the Bureau basement to feel rich in possibilities even if I couldn't afford to make another half dozen genuinely useful objects. Hence the umlaut punch, which works, but just for a moment -- so there's no risk of it expanding the object trees.

Originally there was no gameplay value to the punch, but later when the generator room was introduced, I decided I wanted to include a power cord, and the power chord concept was born. ]

The description of the umlaut punch is "A very heavy, solid object manufactured in Stuttgart. A wire basket holds the item to be punched; two sharp metal tines descend into the basket at the moment of use." Understand "wire basket" or "basket" or "sharp" or "metal" or "tines" as the umlaut punch. The heft of the umlaut punch is 3. The umlaut punch is a container.


Understand "punch [something]" as umlaut-punching when the umlaut punch is visible.

umlaut-punching is an action applying to one thing.

The power chord is an r-abstract noisy thing. "A power chord vibrates ominously in the air." The description of the power chord is "The chord [--] played as though by electric guitar [--] almost makes it sound as though heavy machinery is in use in here."
	The introduction of the power chord is "Having a leftover like this is… unusual. A sign of spare reification energy in this area, maybe. Like radiation left over from some really high energy abstraction work."

Instead of listening to the power chord:
	say "The repeated power chord makes it sound as though some heavy equipment is being used in here even when it's not."

Chapter 14 - The Catalan punt volat Needle

[This is a wholly unnecessary toy that exists (a) to give the player something to fiddle with briefly if stuck with the anagramming gun; and (b) to suggest a wider world of language use beyond the shores of Atlantis.]	

The description of the Catalan punt volat needle is "An infinitely delicate tool designed to slip between two Ls. It has no application in English."

Sanity-check inserting the Catalan punt volat needle into something:
	try poking the second noun with the noun instead.
	
Check poking something with something:
	if the player does not carry the second noun:
		try taking the second noun;
	if the player does not carry the second noun:
		stop the action.
		
Check poking something with something which is not the Catalan punt volat needle:
	say "[The second noun] [is-are] not very suitable for the purpose." instead.
	
Check poking the Catalan needle with the Catalan needle:
	say "[The noun] doesn't bend that way." instead.
	
Carry out poking something with the Catalan punt volat needle:
	let sample be indexed text;
	let sample be "[noun]";
	now sample is "[sample in lower case]";
	if sample matches the regular expression "(.*l)(l.*)":
		say "The needle slips into place, trying to construct '[text matching subexpression 1]·[text matching subexpression 2]'. It fails, however, to make any recognizable word out of this, and the needle wire grows hotter and hotter in our hand as it tries to fix the change. Finally [you] have to pull out." instead;
	otherwise:
		say "There's nowhere for the needle to slide in, because there are no paired Ls in [the noun]." instead.
		
Understand "use [catalan punt volat needle] on [something]" as poking it with (with nouns reversed).
Understand "poke [something] with [catalan punt volat needle]" as poking it with. Poking it with is an action applying to one thing and one carried thing.
Understand "poke [something] with [something]" as poking it with.
Understand "poke [something] in/into [something]" as poking it with (with nouns reversed).

Understand the commands "pierce" and "stick" and "penetrate" as "poke".

Chapter 15 - The Workshop Platform

The programmable dais is an enterable supporter in the Workshop. Understand "machine" or "equipment" or "platform" or "big" or "black" or "metal" or "round" or "machinery" or "coil" or "coils" as the dais.
	"A programmable dais sits in the middle of the room. It has the raw look of lab equipment rather than a nice smooth commercial instrument."
	The description is "It's a round black metal platform with substantial stabil[izing] coils visible underneath, five or six feet in diameter. This is experimental lab grade letter equipment, ferociously powerful, insanely dangerous." 
	
After examining the programmable dais:
	say "The dais has [a list of things which are part of the dais]."
	
The big lever is part of the programmable dais. The big lever is a device. The description is "One of those big heavy levers you see at demolitions. You won't be tripping this thing by accident."

Understand "flip [something]" as pushing. Understand "use [big lever]" as pushing.

Sanity-check pulling the big lever:
	try switching on the programmable dais instead.
	
Sanity-check pushing the big lever:
	try switching on the programmable dais instead.

Sanity-check putting something irretrievable on the programmable dais:
	if the noun is the player:
		make no decision;
	say "Since [the noun] contain[s] [if the noun encloses the tub][the tub][otherwise]something useful[end if], it might be a bad idea to change its form. [You] might not be able to get the contents back." instead.
	
Sanity-check switching on the programmable dais:
	try switching on the big lever instead.

Sanity-check switching off the programmable dais:
	say "It doesn't stay on long enough to need turning off." instead.
	

[Joke responses. These duplicate, more or less, code for the synthesizer above; inelegant, but there aren't enough of these jokes to be worth a more elaborate implementation of synthesis generally that would take them into account.]

Instead of switching on the big lever when the switch-setting of the massive switch is synthesize and the programmable dais supports the roll and the programmable dais supports the rock:
	say "You can't get to rock & roll with just synthesis. You'd need an ampersand generator, which unfortunately (despite promising research and a prototype resembling a pretzel-maker) has yet to achieve stable results."

Instead of switching on the big lever when the switch-setting of the massive switch is synthesize and the programmable dais supports the sill and the programmable dais supports the cate:
	say "It feels like [you] ought to be close to getting a silicate out of all this, but no, I fear not. That final L on SILL is going nowhere."
	
Instead of switching on the big lever when the switch-setting of the massive switch is synthesize and the programmable dais supports the key-lime and the programmable dais supports a pi-object:
	say "What, are you hoping for key lime π? I'm afraid synthesis doesn't do puns as such."
	
Instead of switching on the big lever when the switch-setting of the massive switch is synthesize and the programmable dais supports the pan and the programmable dais supports the ear:
	say "That Indian soft cheese is called paneer, you know, not panear." 


Instead of switching on the big lever:
	if the boiler is not switched on or a massive plug is free:
		say "[You] pull the lever, but a lot of nothing happens. It doesn't look like there is power flowing to the machine." instead;
	if the switch-setting of the massive switch is:
		-- synthesize:
			if the number of things on the programmable dais is not two:
				say "[The programmable dais] goes red, then dims again when it doesn't find sufficient contents for synthesis." instead;
			synthesize contents of programmable dais instead;
		-- swap homonym:
			if the programmable dais does not support something:
				say "[The programmable dais] goes red. There's a hot smell, as though you'd turned on the stove with no pot on the burner. Finally it dims again." instead;
			if exactly one thing (called target) is on the programmable dais:
				let result be the homonym-match of the target;
				if the result is not the player:
					if something (called the source) proffers the target:
						now the result is not proffered by anything;
						now the source proffers the result;
					abide by the dangerous destruction rules for the target;
					move the result to the programmable dais;
					move the target to the repository;
					if the result is the passage-place:
						say "[The programmable dais] glows deep red, then deeper. There's a roar like a stadium being demolished, and a passage opens, descending into the dais itself." instead;
					otherwise:
						say "[The programmable dais] glows deep red. Almost at once [the result] [is-are] lying on the surface. [result description][line break]" instead;
			say "[The programmable dais] goes red, then dims again. Apparently it can't find a homonym to fit [the list of things on the programmable dais]." instead; 
	now the big lever is switched off.

The massive switch is part of the programmable dais. The description is "A large black switch with a red arrow painted on it. There are two stops, labeled with black marker on tape: [i]swap homonym[/i] and [i]synthesize[/i]. It is currently set to [switch-setting of the massive switch]."

The switch-setting is a kind of value. The switch-settings are swap homonym and synthesize. The massive switch has a switch-setting. The switch-setting of the massive switch is swap homonym. Understand "swap" or "homonym" or "swap homonym" as swap homonym. Understand "synthesise" as synthesize.


[This will catch FLIP SWITCH and a range of similar attempts:]
Sanity-check pushing the massive switch:
	try turning the massive switch instead.
	
Sanity-check pulling the massive switch:
	try turning the massive switch instead.

Carry out turning the massive switch:
	if the switch-setting of the massive switch is swap homonym:
		now the switch-setting of the massive switch is synthesize;
	otherwise:
		now the switch-setting of the massive switch is swap homonym.
		
Report turning the massive switch:
	say "[You] give the switch a strong twist and turn it to [i][the switch-setting of the massive switch][/i]." instead.
	
Understand "switch [massive switch]" as turning.
Understand "switch [massive switch] to [a switch-setting]" as switching it to. 
Understand "switch [something] to [a switch-setting]" as switching it to. 
Understand "set [massive switch] to [a switch-setting]" as switching it to.
Understand "turn [massive switch] to [a switch-setting]" as switching it to.

Understand "set [programmable dais] to [a switch-setting]" as switching it to.
Understand "turn [programmable dais] to [a switch-setting]" as switching it to.

Switching it to is an action applying to one thing and one switch-setting.

Sanity-check switching the programmable dais to the switch-setting understood:
	now the noun is the massive switch.

Check switching something which is not the massive switch to the switch-setting understood:
	say "That is not a setting of [the noun]." instead.
	
Check switching the massive switch to the switch-setting of the massive switch:
	say "[The massive switch] is already set to [switch-setting understood]." instead.
	
Carry out switching the massive switch to the switch-setting understood:
	now the switch-setting of the massive switch is the switch-setting understood.
	
Report switching the massive switch to the switch-setting understood:
	say "[You] give the switch a strong twist and turn it to [the switch-setting of the massive switch]." instead.
	

Test programmable with "tutorial off / x platform / x switch / turn switch / x switch / set switch to swap homonym / switch switch to swap homonym / turn switch to swap homonym / put the crate and the ring on the platform / turn on lever / shoot cratering with gun" holding the crate and the anagramming gun and the ring in the Workshop.

Chapter 16 - The Cryptolock aka Vowel Rotator

[ The cryptolock is a variation on the idea of the spinner introduced much earlier in the game. 

The puzzle here is completely different depending on whether you're playing hard mode or easy mode.]

The cryptolock is a scenery container in the Generator Room. It is fixed in place. The printed name of the cryptolock is "brushed steel bucket". Understand "brushed" or "steel" or "container" or "bucket"  as the cryptolock. 

The cryptoswitch is a device. The cryptoswitch is part of the cryptolock. The printed name of the cryptoswitch is "reverse switch". Understand "reverse" or "switch" as the cryptoswitch.

Report switching on the cryptoswitch:
	say "The switch thunks over into the Reverse position." instead.

The description of the cryptolock is "Attached to the machine is a [cryptolock], with insulated walls; it looks like a large version of an ice bucket for chilling sparkling wines. 

Around the outside of the bucket are all sorts of odd gears, sprockets, parts, and bits, which have been attached in a haphazard way with bolts, wire, and duct tape. Presumably this does something to items placed in the bucket.

At the lip of the bucket is a switch labeled REVERSE. The switch is currently [if the cryptoswitch is switched on]on[otherwise]off[end if]." The carrying capacity of the cryptolock is 1.

The sprocket-bits are part of the cryptolock. Understand "odd" or "gears" or "sprocket" or "sprockets" or "parts" or "bits" or "part" or "bit" or "bolt" or "wire" or "duct" or "tape" as the sprocket-bits. The description of the sprocket-bits is "They're all different metals and component sizes, as though scavenged from other machines. But for what? It would take a much better engineer than I am to guess that."

Check inserting something into the cryptolock when the cryptolock contains something (called the blockage):
	try taking the blockage;
	if the blockage is in the cryptolock:
		stop the action.
		
Check inserting something into the cryptolock when the heft of the noun is greater than 3:
	say "[The noun] [is-are] too big to fit into [the cryptolock]." instead.

A dangerous construction rule for something (called the target):
	if the target is in the cryptolock and the heft of the target is greater than 3:
		now the target is in the Generator Room;
		say "[The target] [is-are] too big to fit into the bucket, and fall[s] out during the process of formation."
		
Test bucket-size with "put coat in bucket / wave a-remover at coat / get cot / put cot in bucket" holding the coat in the Generator Room. 

After inserting something into the cryptolock: 
	let goal text be indexed text;
	if hardness is true:
		if the cryptoswitch is switched on:
			let goal text be the back hard encryption of the noun; 
		else:
			let goal text be the hard encryption of the noun; 
	otherwise:
		if the cryptoswitch is switched on:
			let goal text be the back encryption of the noun; 
		else:
			let goal text be the encryption of the noun; 
	let source hash be the letter-hash of goal text;
[	say "[substitute text]";]
	let chosen article be the noun;
	repeat with item running through things in the repository:
		if the hash code of the item is the source hash:
			let item text be indexed text;
			now item text is "[item]";
			now item text is "[item text in lower case]";
			if the goal text is item text:
				now the chosen article is the item; 
	if the chosen article is not the noun:
		abide by the dangerous destruction rules for the noun;
		now the chosen article is not proffered by anything; 
		now everything which proffers the noun proffers the chosen article;
		if the chosen article is enormous:
			say "There is a churning noise from within [the cryptolock] and '[goal text]' appears in letters of vivid purple smoke. Additional letters read 'SAFETY OVERRIDE.' Then the smoke dissipates without result." instead;
		if an essential thing (called source) proffers the chosen article:
			now the chosen article is essential; 
		[ if something which proffers the chosen article encloses an essential thing:
			now the chosen article is essential; ]
		now everything which is in the cryptolock is in the repository;
		move the chosen article to the cryptolock;
		abide by the dangerous construction rules for the chosen article;
		say "There is a churning noise from within [the cryptolock], and a moment later [you] see inside [a list of things in the cryptolock]. ";
		record "using the vowel rotator" as achieved;
		if the boiler is switched off:
			now the boiler is switched on;
			say "[paragraph break]This appears to have unlocked the mechanism. With a growl, the boiler comes to life.";
		otherwise:
			say "The boiler growls but cannot become any more on than it already is.";
	otherwise:
		say "There is a churning noise from within [the cryptolock] and '[goal text]' appears in letters of hot pink smoke. Then the smoke dissipates without result.". 
		
Test cryptoreverse with "tutorial off / autoupgrade / put gimlet in cryptolock / put earring in cryptolock / put pastis in cryptolock / put pea in cryptolock / put ball in cryptolock / wave g-remover at sign / put sin in cryptolock / put son in cryptolock / put tub in bucket / turn on switch / x cryptolock / put tab in bucket" in the Generator Room holding the tub and ball and the pastis and the earring and the pea and the gimlet and the garish sign.
		
Test crypto with "tutorial off / autoupgrade / x boiler / look through pane / w / turn on platform / e / put gimlet in cryptolock / put earring in cryptolock / put pastis in cryptolock / put pea in cryptolock / put ball in cryptolock / wave g-remover at sign / put sin in cryptolock / put son in cryptolock / x boiler / look through pane / w / turn on platform" in the Generator Room holding the ball and the pastis and the earring and the pea and the gimlet and the garish sign.
	
[In easy mode, each vowel is replaced by the one subsequent, and U in turn becomes A. Y is not considered a vowel for these purposes. 

To avoid confusion during the replacement process, we replace lower-case letters with upper-case ones to show they've already been changed.]

To decide what indexed text is the encryption of (X - a thing):

	let goal text be "[goal text in lower case]";
	decide on goal text. 
	

[In hard mode, each vowel becomes the next consonant in the alphabet and each consonant becomes the next vowel. This has the effect of vastly reducing the number of possible letters in output, and is a bit tricky to think through; but it is possible to get LAMB > OBOE.

To figure out whether the game supplied any objects that could fruitfully be encrypted this way, we ran the encryption on every object in the game and inspected the results for things that were really words.]

Section 3 - Individual Items Broken Down By Product

[ For each source object, we work out the plausible changes on what that item could be made into. Scenery objects for the most part are not changeable, and neither are most objects with attached adjectives, except using the anagramming gun in the end-game. So that cuts down somewhat on the chaos.

Nonetheless, there's still an awful lot to account for. To figure out what needed to be implemented for the letter-remover, I used some perl-created subsets of the Scrabble word list; for instance, I had one reference file that consisted of nothing but valid letter removals, of the form

geniuses with i removed -> genuses

Then whenever I needed to check derivations, I could search this file for the object I was adding to the game (recursively, of course), and see what letter removals were possible. 

A similar wordlist covered words that could be constructed from pairs of other words, for use with the synthesizer. In the process I learned a lot of new words: I'd never heard of ASSART before, for instance, which is the crime of stealing someone's plants. 

To come up with words that could be used with the spinner, I also made a bit of use of this list of semordnilaps:

	http://kgfamily.com/files/semordnilaps.html

For the vowel rotator, I went the other way and ran rotations on everything that already existed in the game world, then culled this to produce a short list of things that were real objects. The algorithm produced a long and surprisingly pleasing (to me, at 1 AM) list of entries such as 

	bokono buttums
	iligently wontir polut
	...
	swetch
	wend betch
	...
	bellcuck
	bentem
	bendot
	...
	shromp cuckteol
	shattlicuck
	spollegi
	sockist uffel
	...
	etc. for hundreds of lines

...which seemed just consistent enough to belong to their own language or possibly to some dialect form of English, while still being essentially silly. Who are these sockists anyway, and why do they keep deluging us with their uffel?

For anagrams, I mostly relied on the internet anagram server website.

The good thing about the anagramming gun is that, while it can produce prodigious numbers of possibilities, I didn't have to implement them as thoroughly, because anagramming is not a completely deterministic process. For instance, the accent flipper would anagram to the flint crepe cap and back again, and the player would have no way to try to specify any other possible variant anagrams. So it was only necessary to provide multiple anagrams of the same phrase if I thought those objects would be interesting or funny to have in the game; otherwise, I just picked the single item that seemed most amusing or tractable and included that.

Despite these attempts at rigor, beta-testers did still discover a number of items that weren't handled. I declined to include the 'vaginal foam sop' that one could hypothetically create out of the the map of Slangovia, but I did incorporate a number of others, from the embarrassingly-obvious-how-did-I-leave-that-out COAT > TACO to the more esoteric COUNTERWEIGHT > TOWERING CHUTE. I did very much want the player at this stage of the game to be encouraged to try the anagramming gun widely -- especially on things with long names -- so that he'd be in the right frame of mind when he came up against Atlantida in the end.]

Chapter 2 - Content Details By Alphabet

[Items in the repository have already been defined, above, but they lack definitions and specialized behavior. This chapter provides those things, in alphabetical order for lack of other organizational principle.]

Section 1 - A

The heft of an aa is 3. The indefinite article of an aa is "some". The description of the aa is "A chunk of rough black lava, scratchy and porous: the kind of rock made when a volcano fountains into the air, not like the ropy smoother sort formed when lava flows in rivers."

Some aas-object are a plural-named thing. The heft of the aas-object is 5. The description of the aas-object is "A large heap of black lava, mounded up as though by a recent eruption." The printed name of the aas-object is "aas". Understand "aas" as the aas-object.

Instead of searching the aas-object: 
	say "There are a surprising number of sharp bits: this is friable stone, but it hasn't yet been eroded into smoothness."


The description of the ad is "A folded, rumpled newspaper ad for [ad subject]." The ad has some text called the ad subject. The heft of the ad is 1.

Before examining the ad for the first time:
	if the restoration gel is not seen:
		change the ad subject of the ad to "Restoring Gel: a unique patented formula to restore lost letters and undo the effects of a letter-remover";

I, on the other hand, am trying to roll our eyes.[or]He acknowledges our glance, then quite deliberately looks away. Do you really go for this stuff?[or]He looks us up and down as though calculating what exactly [you] look like under this modern attire.[as decreasingly likely outcomes]". Understand "gentleman" or "man" or "fellow" as the cad.

[In a much, much earlier version of the game, there were puzzles involving making the cad and then ordering him to do things (first bribing him with a kiss). As the game progressed and the tone shifted, this bit of silliness came to seem out of place; and, worse, it became obvious that having dozens and dozens of possibly persuadable, action-taking NPCs would significantly complicate implementation. So all the persuasion rules were axed and there are no puzzles involving getting generated NPCs to do things, aside from the mechanic in the garage.]

		persuasion fails. ]

Instead of kissing the cad: 
	say "[one of]Summoning your courage and all my patience, [you] stand on tip-toes and kiss the gentleman. He returns the fav[our], with all the skill that his nature requires.
	
You, I can tell, are enjoying this. I on the other hand am going to have to gouge it out of my brain with a power drill later.[or]You repeat your earlier performance, while I do my level best to stop you.[stopping]".


Every turn when the player carries the cad:
	move the cad to the location;
	say "[The cad] turns out to be a tall and somewhat muscular gentleman, and [you] are unable to support him during the transformation; by the time it is done, he is more standing in our embrace than actually being carried by us. I take a hasty, embarrassed step back.
	
He smiles knowingly, but merely straightens his cuffs."
	
[Unsuccessful attempt by the cad trying doing something:
	say "[one of]But [--] wouldn't you have expected it? [--] the cad is unable to fulfill his promise.[or][paragraph break]'I regret,' he says, with a bow, 'that I am unable to oblige.'[paragraph break]After trying for a moment, he says, 'Alas, I believe you have asked too great a fav[our].'[or][paragraph break]'This is harder than I expected,' he remarks after a moment. 'And insufficiently entertaining.'[or][paragraph break]'This is worse than the incident with Sally Jersey and her chambermaid,' he mutters under his breath, giving up.[as decreasingly likely outcomes]". ]
	
Instead of putting the restoration gel on the cad:
	say "As you approach, he takes a step backward and fends you off with one (finely-boned yet manly) hand. [one of]'I think not,' he says, in a low voice that thrills you deeply. 'I never would allow a lady to apply an unknown liniment to my person.'[or]Apparently he hasn't changed his stance on unidentified substances.[stopping]".

[card]


[The aim here is to hint at an Atlantean tarot, focusing especially on cards that have something to do with the relationship of the state and the individual, or duality within the individual. Strength is traditionally shown as a young lady managing a tame lion, but there are no lions on Atlantis; whereas the squid is associated with Atlantean inventiveness and power but suggests tentacle porn as well; the squid is a subversive force.

'Take 10 gallons of ale and a large cock, the older the better; parboil the cock, flay him, and stamp him in a stone mortar until his bones are broken (you must gut him when you flay him). Then, put the cock into two quarts of sack, and put to it five pounds of raisins of the sun-stoned; some blades of mace, and a few cloves.

topic	num	description
"1942"	1942	"Here is her militant 1940s rendition, where she stands bestride Atlantis; Axis planes are flying past her at head level. At any moment she might bite one and shake it, like a bulldog"
"1951"	1951	"Atlantida sits on a throne, wearing a blue dress and an incongruous string of housewifely pearls. In her right hand is the letter A with atom-like rings around it [--] as though to claim that letters are the true atoms of the universe"
"1958"	1958	"A sassy, security-conscious spirit of Atlantis, wearing a secretarial suit and putting a finger to her lips: the wink apparently means that it's alluring not to tell things to spies"
"1964"	1964	"This dossier contains a political cartoon: under comic OOPS lettering, Atlantida is seen shoveling dirt back over an assortment of ancient-looking lamps, pottery, and broken columns. Probably a reference to that incident where a portion of a Roman villa came to light and caused a temporary disruption in the strength of local conversions"
"1968"	1968	"The 1968 edition was some sort of hippy goddess of plenty (flowing hair, flowing skirts, cornucopia of local fruits)"

"1975"	1975	"There isn't any official propaganda for this year, only a contemporary magazine cover showing Atlantida arm in arm with Uncle Sam. Hard to tell for sure whether that was praise or criticism"

"1989"	1989	"Newspaper clippings only. In one cartoon, Atlantida is imprisoned, looking out of the bars of her cell at Czechoslovakian and Romanian revolutionaries in envy at their newfound freedom. Another is just a written column commenting on the bicentennial of the French Revolution and suggesting that the figure of Atlantida is now associated with the spirit of revolutionary change"
"1991"	1991	"Photographs of rioters in Deep Street show people carrying posters of a bare-breasted Atlantida"
"1994"	1994	"Print-offs from an the early days of the world wide web show Atlantida's Home Page, plainly an organ[izing] platform for those interested in overthrowing the Bureau and promoting the more frequent and rigorous use of referendum voting. One imagines the site was shut down shortly thereafter"
"2003"	2003	"The dossier for 2003 is very thick. Memos back and forth indicate that officials are increasingly concerned with Atlantida and feel it is time (for some reason) to reclaim the figure as a 'government-positive' image.

"knights" or "templar" or "knights templar"	"I'm not quite sure, because the language is deliberately obscure, but I think it's meant as an indictment of religious avocation. But I'm not sure.

[One of the things I set out to do with the puzzle system in my previous game Savoir-Faire was to duplicate all the dull standard puzzles I was sick of seeing, but with some new twist on them that hadn't been done before. The one that there was really no way to include, however, was the password puzzle: too many IF games use password puzzles as a form of riddle (where you have to guess on the basis of some hints) or a cheap search puzzle (where the answer is written down on a note near the computer). Never in IF does anyone follow good security protocols with strong passwords that aren't written down. 

So, I thought, what about a puzzle where people do use fairly unguessable passwords, but the whole concept of a 'password' is compromised by some other law of the universe?]

		let the relevant keyboard be a random keyboard which is part of the relevant computer;

	carry out the rewarding successful answering activity with the chosen program;

Section 12 - Power Cord

[This section incorporates the power cord but also the rest of the socketry, etc. It would also have been reasonable to define this stuff in the Generator Room section, but it felt easier to keep all the relevant parts together in one place.

Plugging things into other things is one of those maddening verbs that needs a lot of implementation just to cover the standard idiomatic ways of talking about it. We want the player to feel there's enough depth here that they can unplug bits individually, but "PLUG IN DAIS" should also just work, given the presence of the power cord. 

Another complication comes from the destructibility of objects; if the player gels or anagrams the power cord while it's plugged in, it should automatically unplug, or some weird results may appear when it's reconstructed.]

Test cord with "test chord / get cord / test plugging".

Test plugging with "look / x socket / x wall socket / x dais / x dais socket / get wall socket / get dais socket / plug cord into wall socket / plug plug into dais socket / unplug dais / unplug wall socket / plug wall socket into dais / unplug cord / plug cord into dais / take plug / unplug cord / plug in dais / test gun-ownership / shoot cord with gun / look / shoot crow with gun / x cord / unplug cord / plug in dais" in the Workshop.

	if a massive plug is plugged into the dais socket and a massive plug is plugged into the wall socket:
		say ", connecting [the dais socket] to [the wall socket]. ";
	otherwise if a massive plug is plugged into the dais socket:
		say ", plugged into [the dais socket] and with the other end dangling free. ";

A power socket called a wall socket is fixed in place in the Workshop. "A specialized wall socket is built into the east wall, clearly not part of the ordinary power system for the Bureau."

A power socket called a dais socket is part of the programmable dais.

After printing the name of the dais socket while examining:
	say "[if something is plugged into the dais socket and there is a free massive plug] (with power cord attached, though the cord connects to nothing)[otherwise if something is plugged into the dais socket] (from which a power cord runs to the wall)[otherwise] (with no cord currently plugged in)[end if]"
	 
Attachment relates one massive plug to one power socket. The verb to be plugged into implies the attachment relation.

Sanity-check an actor inserting the power cord into a power socket:
	if a free massive plug (called target plug) is part of the power cord:
		try the actor plugging the target plug into the second noun instead.
		
Sanity-check inserting a massive plug into a power socket:
	try the actor plugging the noun into the second noun instead.
	
Sanity-check taking a massive plug:
	if the noun is plugged into something (called the target):
		try unplugging the noun from the target instead;
	otherwise:
		try taking the power cord instead.

Understand "unplug [a massive plug] from [a power socket]" as unplugging it from. Understand "unplug [something] from [something]" as unplugging it from. Unplugging it from is an action applying to two things. Understand "unplug [something]" as unplugging it from.

Rule for supplying a missing second noun when unplugging something from:
	if the noun is a massive plug:
		if the noun is plugged into something (called target socket):
			now the second noun is the target socket;
		otherwise:
			say "[The noun] is not plugged in anyhow." instead;
	otherwise if the noun is a power socket:
		if something (called target plug) is plugged into the noun:
			now the second noun is the noun;
			now the noun is the target plug;
		otherwise:
			say "Nothing is plugged into [the noun] anyway." instead;
	otherwise if the noun incorporates a power socket (called target socket):
		if something (called target plug) is plugged into the target socket:
			now the second noun is the target socket;
			now the noun is the target plug;
		otherwise:
			say "Nothing is plugged into [the noun] anyway." instead;
			
Sanity-check unplugging something which incorporates a power socket from something which incorporates a power socket:
	try freeing the power cord instead.

Sanity-check unplugging something which is not a massive plug from something:
	say "[The noun] [is-are] not a plug to start with." instead.
	
Sanity-check unplugging something from something which is not a power socket:
	say "[The second noun] [is-are] not a socket." instead.
	
Sanity-check unplugging a free massive plug from something:
	say "[The noun] [is-are] not plugged in anyway." instead.

Carry out unplugging something from something:
	now the noun is not plugged into the second noun.
	
Report unplugging something from something:
	say "[You] unplug [the noun] from [the second noun][if two free massive plugs are part of the power cord]. Both ends of the power cord are now free[otherwise]. The other plug is still attached to [the random power socket which is not the second noun][end if]."
	
Understand "unplug [the power cord]" as freeing. Freeing is an action applying to one thing.

Sanity-check freeing the power cord:
	if the number of free massive plugs is 2:
		say "The power cord is already detached." instead.

Carry out freeing:
	repeat with item running through massive plugs which are plugged into a power socket:
		if the item is plugged into a power socket (called target socket):
			try unplugging the item from the target socket.
	
Understand "plug [a free massive plug] into [a power socket]" as plugging it into. Understand "plug [a massive plug] into [a power socket]" as plugging it into.  Understand "plug [something] into [something]" as plugging it into. 

Understand "plug in [a free massive plug] to [a power socket]" as plugging it into. Understand "plug in [a massive plug] to [a power socket]" as plugging it into.  Understand "plug in [something] to [something]" as plugging it into. 


Plugging it into is an action applying to two things.

Definition: a massive plug is free if it is not plugged into a power socket. 

Sanity-check plugging something which is not a massive plug into a power socket:
	if the noun is the power cord:
		if a massive plug (called target plug) is free:
			try plugging the target plug into the second noun instead;
		otherwise:
			say "The power cord is already fully plugged in." instead;
	say "That's not what the best electrical safety engineers recommend." instead.
	
Sanity-check plugging a massive plug into something which is not a power socket:
	say "Better look for a socket instead." instead.
	
Sanity-check plugging the power cord into something:
	if the second noun is a power socket:
		if a massive plug (called target plug) is free:
			try plugging the target plug into the second noun instead;
		otherwise:
			say "The plugs are fully plugged in already." instead;
	otherwise if the second noun incorporates a power socket (called target socket):
		if a massive plug (called target plug) is free:
			try plugging the target plug into the target socket instead;
		otherwise:
			say "The plugs are fully plugged in already." instead;

Carry out plugging a massive plug into a power socket:
	if the power cord is not in the location:
		silently try dropping the power cord;
	now the noun is plugged into the second noun.
	
Report plugging a massive plug into a power socket:
	say "[You] plug the power cord firmly into [the second noun][if a free massive plug is part of the power cord]. The other end remains free and not plugged into anything[otherwise]. Both ends of the power cord are now plugged in, so the dais is connected to the wall socket[end if]." instead.
	
Sanity-check going somewhere when the player carries the power cord:
	if the number of free massive plugs is less than 2:
		try dropping the power cord;
		if the player carries the power cord:
			stop the action.

Understand "plug [a power socket] into [a power socket]" as connecting it to.  Understand "plug in [a power socket] in [a power socket]" as connecting it to. Connecting it to is an action applying to two things.

Sanity-check an actor connecting something to something:
	if the actor does not carry the power cord:
		if the actor can see the power cord:
			try the actor taking the power cord;
		if the actor does not carry the power cord:
			if the actor is the player:
				say "Some kind of power cord would be needed to bridge the gap.";
			stop the action.
		
Carry out an actor connecting something to something:
	unless something is plugged into the noun:
		let the target plug be a random free massive plug;
		try plugging the target plug into the noun;
	if a massive plug (called next target plug) is free:
		try plugging the next target plug into the second noun;

Understand "plug in [something]" as connecting.
	Connecting is an action applying to one thing.
	
Sanity-check connecting something:
	if the noun is a power socket: 
		make no decision;
	if the noun is a massive plug:
		make no decision;
	if the noun incorporates a power socket:
		make no decision;
	if the noun incorporates a massive plug:
		make no decision;
	if the noun is a device:
		say "[The noun] appear[s] to be adequately powered already." instead;
	say "[The noun] feature[s] no dangling power cords or sockets." instead.

Carry out an actor connecting something:
	try the actor connecting the dais socket to the wall socket.

[There's really no particular point to having the britishizing goggles change the compatibility of the plug. I just couldn't resist.]

Sanity-check putting something which is not wearable on the rack:

[Originally the rock was described as "hefty and jagged, like the result of a volcanic event". Then I went to Kilauea on vacation and picked up some volcanic rocks, and they were the lightest rocks I've ever lifted. So that had to go. I decided that Brock's supportive personality, rather than his unpredictability, was the thing I wanted to express in the rock description. 

geology.about.com lists basalt as a fairly dense rock, denser than limestone, marble, or granite; other weighty options included peridotite, gabbro, and diorite, but I figured those would be less familiar to the player.]

The description of the rock is "Heavy, dark, and roughly hexagonal, like a slice of basalt column.". The rock is essential.
	The scent-description is "mud".

Before putting the restoration gel on the rock when the rock is in a container (called the holder):
	say "(first removing the rock so Brock isn't squished by [the holder])[command clarification break]";
	try taking the rock;
	if the player does not carry the rock:
		stop the action.

Test rock-bug with "put rock in t-inserter / open tub / gel rock" holding the rock and the tub in the Sensitive Equipment Testing Room.

The roc is a rideable animal. "The roc towers over us, looking smarter than a bird has the right to look." The description of the roc is "The bird is enormous[if the location is indoors], so big it seems incredible that it can even fit into the room[end if]. Brock is a tall man, but not nearly this tall. Its eyes are bright and (if [you] [are] not reading too much in) ironically clever; its plumage a little like an eagle's, if an eagle were made many times larger and feathered in a kind of sleek, luminous black."

[Every turn when the roc is in the Sunning Deck and the Sunning Deck is the location:
	say "[one of][The roc]'s claws dig into the cushions of the sunning deck as the yacht pitches[or][roc-igloo][or][The roc] stretches its wings out so that they reach the whole width of the yacht[or]I catch [the roc] looking at us[at random].".]
	
[To say roc-igloo:
	say "[one of][The roc] takes an interest in the white igloo-shaped thing that handles the yacht wifi[or]A tap of beak on plastic tells you [the roc] is checking out the wifi further[if Slango can see the roc][queue Slango-irritation as postponed optional][end if][or][The roc] turns its head experimentally and tries to fit the whole wifi antenna into its beak[stopping]".]

Instead of waving the letter-remover at the rock creating the roc when the location is indoors:
	say "[You][']d probably best wait until [you] [are] outside; I don't know what the consequence would be of generating a massive legendary bird of prey inside a small office building."

Instead of waving the letter-remover at the rock creating the roc when the location is the Open Sea:
	say "A bird that size would sink a little tiny boat like this one."
	
Rule for writing a paragraph about Slango when the roc is mentionable:
	say "[Slango] has come out, though he's standing well back from [the roc], which is surveying the scene speculatively.[paragraph break]"
	
Roc-flight is a scene. Roc-flight begins when the player can see the roc. Roc-flight ends when the player is enclosed by the roc. 
 
Sanity-check mounting the roc:
	if the player can see a heavy handled thing (called the encumbrance) which is not the roc:
		say "[You][']ll want to bring [the encumbrance], but in [its-their] current state, [it-they] [is-are] much too heavy." instead.

Before mounting the roc:
	repeat with item running through things in the location:
		if the item is handled:
			try the player taking the item.
	[repeat with item running through visible handled things which are not enclosed by the player:
		try the player taking the item;
	repeat with item running through visible handled things which are not enclosed by the player:
		try the roc taking the item.]
		
Every turn during roc-flight:
	if the roc is in the location and a random chance of 1 in 2 succeeds:
		say "[one of]The roc looks sharply at [the random visible thing][or]I am starting to find it unnerving how the roc looks at us[or]Are you sure that rocs don't eat people? It's giving us quite an intent stare[or]The roc paces up and down[or]The roc spreads its wings, then folds them again. It could really double as a pavilion if it would stay still in that position[or]The roc throws its head back and screams horribly for no obvious reason[or]The roc dips its beak in the water, then spits violently[at random]."
	
When roc-flight ends:
	say "It stares at us for a moment, and you climb carefully onto its back, putting our arms around its neck. A dozen drawbacks occur at the last minute. What if there isn't enough room for the takeoff? What if it needs to run [--] like a plane [--] before it can get airborne?";
	try the roc going down.
	
After roc going down from Precarious Perch: 
	try the roc going north;
	follow the compass-drawing rule.

Report the roc going north from Precarious Perch:
	say "The roc strains its neck forward, spreads its wings and steps off the cliff. Its flaps are slow and [you] [are] losing altitude [--] so fast that at first I think [you][']ll fall into the ocean [--] but it takes only five or six flaps before the bird is able to glide straight out to sea." instead.
	
Report the roc going north from Abandoned Shore:
	say "The roc rather awkwardly climbs to the highest spot of rock it can easily reach. Then it strains its neck forward, spreads its wings and steps off the cliff. Its flaps are slow and [you] are losing altitude [--] so fast that at first I think [you][']ll fall into the ocean [--] but it takes only five or six flaps before the bird is able to glide straight out to sea." instead.
	
[The roc flies more or less the way condors fly, as documented by youtube. I'm not sure how far a bird of the roc's mass would need to descend before starting to glide, and almost certainly I haven't given it enough clearance, but text is at least more forgiving than an animation would be.]
	
Roc-soaring is a scene. Roc-soaring begins when roc-flight ends. Roc-soaring ends when the time since roc-soaring began is 2 minutes.

Sanity-check doing something other than examining or looking during roc-soaring:
	say "I don't know about you, but I don't dare do anything but hang on." instead.
	
Sanity-check going somewhere during roc-soaring:
	say "I think [you] pretty much have to go where the roc wants to go." instead.

Instead of looking during roc-soaring:
	say "The ocean is many feet below; a fall might not kill us, but it would certainly hurt. The sun has nearly set, and the sky is a soft blue, tempered by the evening haze.

If [you] crane as far as [you] safely can over our left shoulder, [you] can see the coastline near my house, and the old city walls, and the last trails of sunlight on the water."

When roc-soaring ends:
	say "I keep thinking [you] [are] going to lose our grip, but somehow [you] manage to stay on. Sooner than I expect, [you] make out the shine of Slango's yacht, and in the next moment [you] [are] above it. The roc circles once or twice before coming to land on the Sunning Deck.";
	change the initial appearance of Slango to "Slango is out, having seen us landing. He looks nervy.";

Report examining the tale:
	record "Propper Rosehip award for talespinning" as an achievement;
	continue the action.

[Here we want to suggest a timeless but suitably Atlantean fairy tale, which we assemble in pseudo-Proppian fashion. Themes hint at rampant xenophobia, problems with distribution of wealth, concerns about class and democracy, the roles of science and superstition, ambivalence towards organized religion, layers of polytheistic as well as Christian culture, superstitions about language, uncertainty about the behavior of abstract objects and beings, and other problems that presumably were emerging over the past several centuries of Atlantean history. 

At the same time, the tale is generative and intentionally reveals its generative nature, rather than just being a cycling set of pre-written tales, for two reasons. One, I like some of the curious themes or idiosyncracies that arise from the automatic generation (e.g., a hero who defeats a robber... using something he himself stole; the hero gives up literacy to appease an angry demon and is rewarded with a mask of words...); two, many of the game's abstracts do have a randomized, unstable quality and I wanted to continue that feel. 

Conceptually, this passage also owes a little bit to Andrew Plotkin's Matter of the Monster and to some blog comments from Ian Millington about generating semi-random content. It's not, of course, a particularly elegant implementation of that concept.

Contrast the inciting fable, which needs to have one and just one form.]

A tab is r-abstract. The description of the tab is "It lists the price of a tasting menu for two at the Literal Restaurant (seven courses not counting the intermezzo beet sorbet), with accompanying wine flights, espresso, and brandy to follow. Someone's expense account is shivering in a corner right now."

The heft of the tack is 1. The description of a tack is "The kind of thing used to stick papers to corkboards. It's pointy."

The description of the tat is "It looks like the end-of-day leftovers from a particularly ill-fav[our]ed yard sale. What's not broken is dirty, and what's not dirty is in terrible taste. There's a mechanical pencil with no lead, and a kiddie pool that leaks; a stained tablecloth that once had a pattern of squid tentacles on it; a bobble-headed doll representing the head player of the Maiana football team thirteen years ago."

The ten-object is r-abstract. The heft of the ten-object is 0. Understand "ten" or "10" as the ten-object. The description of a ten-object is usually "The number of fingers, the number of toes." The printed name of a ten-object is usually "ten".

The description of the Tao is "It presents itself as one of those circular yin-yang symbols, part black, part white. I'm afraid Atlantean understanding of Asian philosophies is fairly simplistic."

The description of the tea is "It manifested steaming hot." Understand "earl grey" or "earl gray" or "lapsang" or "souchong" or "green tea" or "toasted rice" as the tea. [I was very very tempted to put the tea in a vintage tea cup, as I spent part of the summer collecting such cups on eBay for a party, and I had in the process cluttered my brain with a lot of useless information about historical tea cup brands and patterns that clearly needed to go somewhere. But then I realized that it would be kind of a bother implementing the cup separately from the tea, and inconsistent with how other liquid manifestations usually work, and so I decided not to after all. The reader is invited to picture her choice of Aynsley, Paragon, Wedgewood, Royal Albert, Limoges, Lomonosov, etc. tea cup as she wishes.]

Check waving the letter-remover at the tea when the current setting of the letter-remover is "t":

[The tick is a problem. It's technically an animal, but it shouldn't act like animals act because it's too small. In fact, it's so small that it's not realistic for the player to be able to hold onto it for long. Fortunately, though, the stick isn't an essential item in the game, so we can afford to lose it. This is one place where I have Alex really step in and take some action if the player doesn't do something: either we change the tick back into the sticky in a few moves, or we lose it.]

Tick-removal is a scene. Tick-removal begins when the player can see the tick.

Every turn during tick-removal:
	say "[one of]That is, of course, if it doesn't attach to our skin and give us Lyme disease[or]I guess what I'm trying to say here is that I don't want our very own pet tick[or]...Okay, sorry, there's something I just need to do here. Blame my phobias if you will[stopping]."

The description of the till is "An old-fashioned cash register with separate keys for half- and quarter-cents: Atlantean currency inflated more slowly than most, and still had absurdly low numbers until we went over to the Euro. Both sides are molded with a graceful female figure holding a cornucopia of goods from land and sea." The till is an openable closed container.

The description of the tills is "There is a whole heap of them, mostly old-style cash registers from before they were computerized, but also some more recent sorts, and even one of those clever modern ones that is just a prop for a tablet computer."

The tillage is r-abstract. The description of the tillage is "The fleeting images show acres of rolling farmland being worked over in preparation for planting. It looks like more wide-open space than we usually have in one place here on Atlantis. Perhaps the farmland pictured is French or even American."

	Instead of opening a tin-can:

A tint is r-abstract. The description of a tint is "A [one of][primary-modifier] shade of [primary-color][or][pastel-modifier] shade of [pastel-color][or][secondary-modifier] shade of [secondary-color][at random], as though someone had watercol[our]ed that bit of air."

The description of the alterna-tit is "It is indeed a severed breast. Maybe a C-cup, creamy-skinned and all, but the fact that it looks like it's been raggedly chopped off by a serial killer really decreases the appeal."

The titter is r-abstract and noisy. The description of the titter is "It's just about invisible except as a ripple in the air, but it sounds like a girl laughing behind her hand. Repeatedly."

Instead of listening to the titter:
	say "The titter says, '[titter-noise]!'"

[There's really no need for the randomized laughter here, but then again, why not? It's in keeping with lots of other elements in the game.]

To say titter-noise:
	let sound be indexed text;
	let sound be "[one of]hee[or]he[or]hu[at random]";

 It is background-information.

[This pointless bit of cheeseshop-style foolishness doesn't really accomplish anything, but for some reason my beta-testers kept coming up with new vegetables to ask him about until I expanded the range of conversation quite a bit.

Section 8 - Backpacking Girl

[The backpacking girl is your basic standard NPC impediment -- much more so than just about any of the NPCs who come after, though both Waterstone and Higgate are fetch-quest NPCs after a fashion. 

From a narrative point of view, the backpacking girl is present to establish early on

-- that some people do come to Atlantis as tourists; it's not completely sheltered; on the other hand, their expectations are not the same as those of people used to the island long-term

-- to establish a line in the level of social inappropriateness our protagonist is allowed to show. Violence, no; doing things that may shock, surprise, or distress other characters is, however, allowed within reason. (The backpacking girl doesn't really take any harm from the experience.)

-- to bond Alex and Andra as people who are both, in their own ways, significantly more knowing than she is

The Vatican snowglobe is a real souvenir that some fellow hostel-dwellers in Rome produced with great delight. ]

			say run paragraph on; 
			try the backpacking girl trying examining the player;
		otherwise:
			say "[one of]She tosses restlessly[or]She turns over[or]She bangs her head against the space where a pillow ought to be[or]She scrubs at her eyes with one hand[at random].[run paragraph on]".

	
Report the backpacking girl trying dropping the heavy pack:
	say "With a grunt, she shrugs off her pack and puts it on the ground near one of the beds.[run paragraph on]" instead.
	
Report the backpacking girl trying entering a bed:
	say "She eyes the beds thoughtfully, punches each of the mattresses in turn, and then climbs into the one she's selected.[run paragraph on]" instead.

Report the backpacking girl trying examining a thing:
	say "She checks out [the noun].[run paragraph on]" instead.
	
Report the backpacking girl trying getting off a bed:
		say "The bed creaks as she rolls off it in unseemly haste. She doesn't meet our eye, but mutters something about needing to go buy something right away." instead.

[Report the backpacking girl trying going to a room (called destiny) when the actor is avoiding:
	record "getting the dorm room to ourselves" as achieved;
	say "A moment later she is gone." instead. ]
	 
Report the backpacking girl trying saying hello to the player:

[The scene with the activist is not a puzzle in any meaningful sense: we can walk on past the activist at any time. However, it does serve as a pacing device, slowing down access to SJ Hall. It also provides some useful exposition about what Alex is working on.

We can end the scene in three ways: by leaving, by donating money to the cause (which Alex won't like, since he considers it culpably naive), and by explaining to her at length why her idea is flawed.

Once the activist has left the area, her sign will be available for us to take, and we can make it into a sin or a sig if we're so inclined. (It is one of four signs we can affect, not including the sign on Atlantida's neck.)]

Studies have shown that people's word concepts are very persistent in that way [--] and anyway there are a variety of reasons why even if you could do it, it would be very bad to overwrite the linguistic efficacy of [']water['].'".
 The response is "She purses her lips. 'You're in Language Studies, aren't you?' she asks. 'I was warned about people from your department. You can be very negative.'".
 It quip-supplies the activist.
 It directly-follows whether this liquid will be water.

 It mentions environment, research.
 The comment is "'Negative or not, it is true,' we say. 'If you try to teach people a new word for an existing substance, you have to fight with their preconceptions about how to categor[ize] that substance.

 The response is "'All right,' she says belligerently. 'How would you do it?' [paragraph break]At this precise moment I feel myself fall for this girl. She's still naive and earnest and probably too young for me, but there is something about the determination and assertion and the spirit of I-dare-you-to-think-of-one-better that makes me want to drag her off to a coffee shop and enlighten her for four or five hours. 

But I bet you wouldn't like to play gooseberry to that expedition.".

Forget Spanish, Hindi, Russian, Arabic. You have to make a [i]new language[/i] to resolve these difficulties, and you have to teach it on an epic scale.'".
 The response is "She has been leaning in, breathlessly, to listen to this explanation, but now she backs up and looks at us like we've sprouted a second head, which, all things considered, would not be all that unnatural. [paragraph break]'That would take forever!' she exclaims. (I had calculated maybe fifty or a hundred years to the first significant successes, but I suppose that is not unlike forever if you're sufficiently short-sighted.) 'And you'd need a huge amount of money!' [paragraph break]I sigh. 'All the same,' we say, a little sadly. 'It would work better than what you're proposing here. I'm sorry.

Section 2 - The Barman

[Parker the barman has two critical functions:

-- to guide us towards Lena as our next contact
-- to let us play the game that wins the origin paste.

Once these things have occurred, he fades into the background somewhat; after Slango appears at Counterfeit Monkey, Parker's description in the room is partially suppressed to reflect the fact that the protagonist's attention has moved elsewhere.

Conceptually, the game-playing trick sort of recapitulates the bit with the barker at the very beginning of the game, except that this time the challenge is considerably more difficult and at the same time Andra provides more coaching on it. 

Another way to look at it is that tests and games are a narratively lazy excuse to introduce puzzles. This is a valid criticism. However, there are a couple of compensating advantages that made me think it was worth using them anyway. First, these games create a sense of playfulness in Atlantean culture about the effects of letter-removal; otherwise, we mostly see it being used either to exert authoritarian power (when used by the Bureau) or to conduct criminal activities (when used by the smugglers and others). Second, this particular game demonstrates the funny way that the Counterfeit Monkey skirts illegality using technically permissible activities.]

Understand "ask [barman] for [any barman-carried thing]" as requesting it from (with nouns reversed).  

Definition: a thing is barman-carried if it is carried by the barman.

The barman is criminal and alert. Understand "man" or "bar man" as the barman.

The greeting of the barman is "[one of]'Help you?' asks Parker the barman unenthusiastically[or]Parker acknowledges our return with a nod[stopping]."

whether he hath seen slango is a questioning quip.
 The printed name is "whether he has seen Slango". The true-name is "whether he hath seen slango". 
 Understand "has" or "if" or "parker" or "barman" or "bartender" as whether he hath seen slango.  The comment is "'I wonder whether you've seen an associate of mine,' we say to Parker. 'Name of Slango.'".
 It mentions Slango.
 The response is "Parker looks over the bar at us. 'He comes in here from time to time,' he says. 'Very regular customer. Always has about three rum and cokes.' [paragraph break]This is a lie, and therefore a test. Slango doesn't drink alcohol himself and doesn't permit drunkenness in his crew.".
 It quip-supplies the barman.
 It is restrictive.

 challenge Parker about the rum is a performative quip. The comment is "'Must be a different Slango,' we say. 'Mine is more of a root beer man. Thanks anyway though[slango-friendship].'".
 It mentions Slango.
 The response is "'Oh, [i]that[/i] Slango,' Parker says[if the origin paste is visible and the origin paste is not seen], thoughtfully moving [the origin paste] sitting on the bar[end if]. 'He's been around town the last couple of days, but not today. If you know his lady friend[lena-needed], you might try her.' [paragraph break]Lady friend? [if the Aquarium is visited]Lena, presumably, but you didn't real[ize] she and Slango had progressed to quite that status[otherwise]This can only mean Lena, she being the only female native with whom Slango spends much time socially. But you wouldn't have guessed that she'd advanced to the status of [i]lady friend[/i]. Either way, Lena is a rather odd woman who keeps a used bookstore off Deep Street[end if].".
 It quip-supplies the barman.
 It directly-follows whether he hath seen slango.
Understand "barman" or "him" or "bartender" as challenge Parker about the rum.

 Understand "have" or "if" as whether we can hath origin paste.  The comment is "'That Origin Paste for sale?' ".
 It mentions origin paste.
 The response is "'Well now,' he says, grinning, 'that would surely be illegal, would it not? Origin Paste is after all a controlled substance in this country, due to its unhappy association with fraudulent activities. On the other hand there is no law against someone [i]winning[/i] the Origin Paste in a completely legitimate game of chance or skill.'".
 It quip-supplies the barman.

The comment is "'Explain this game as though I have no idea what you're talking about,' you say, leaning on the bar in an interested fashion. Are you flirting with Parker? No? Okay. Good to know.".
 It mentions origin paste.
 The response is "'It's a designated challenge game,' says Parker. You've seen this played before, but he explains the rules anyway. [paragraph break]'There are two contestants, one challenger and one defender.

'The challenger chooses any object he likes and shows it to the moderator ahead of time. 

'The defender, without seeing the object, stipulates a general category. The challenger has five minutes to turn his designated object into an item that fits the defender's category, or he forfeits his ante.'".

	if the player consents:
		continue the action;
	otherwise:

To decide whether game is in progress:
	if origin paste is won:
		no;
	if the wager is not yourself:
		yes;

		yes;
	no.
	
[An availability rule for give up:

 It mentions yourself, origin paste.
 The response is "He grins and shrugs sympathetically. 'Bad luck.'".
 It quip-supplies the barman ]

wager-won is an NPC-directed quip.
	The response is "'A winner!' says the barman, straightening up. 'What do you know?

Section 3 - Slango

[ Slango is our first live encounter with anyone out of Andra's past; he's significant because he introduces the first really serious setback of the plot.

In conversation with Slango, we see Andra's personality surfacing a little bit more and coming into conflict with Alex's. Because she's comfortable with Slango, Andra becomes brasher, a little cruder, and more outspoken; more like the self she's become in the company of the smugglers. (Some of the same characteristics surface with Lena.)

This scene can only end in one way -- with the player agreeing to pursue clues about Brock -- because otherwise we'd be missing the whole rest of the game. 

Given all this, the chief design problems are to maximize expressiveness during this part of the plot and help the player feel it's something other than completely railroaded. (That is to say, most of the available choices are expressive and reflective choices, but that doesn't make them wholly meaningless.) We can choose to push Slango or to go along with him, and emotive options are more richly implemented in this scene than in many of the other scenes of the game.]

The greeting of Slango is "'Hiya,' Slango says."
	
Rule for beat-producing during consulting-Slango:
	if the barman does not know slango-friendship:
		now the barman knows slango-friendship;
		say "Out of the corner of our eye, we see the barman looking steadily at us[if the barman recollects whether he hath seen slango]. Concluding that we know Slango after all, perhaps[otherwise]. We turn deliberately back to Slango[end if].[run paragraph on]";
	otherwise:
		say "[one of]Over the voices of the crowd comes the sound of the barman setting out another round[or]Raised voices near the bar interrupt you for a moment[or]We're all silent as the door of the pub opens and closes and a large man walks past us[or]A squabble breaks out over by the darts board[or]A dart bounces off the dart board and lands near your foot. A gruff man retrieves it with muttered apologies[as decreasingly likely outcomes]. [run paragraph on]".

consulting-Slango is a scene. consulting-Slango begins when the current interlocutor is Slango. consulting-Slango ends when "Finally find Slango at Counterfeit Monkey" is completed.

Instead of saying hello to Slango when Slango does not recollect who we seem:
	try discussing who we seem.


 who we seem is an informative quip. 
 The printed name is "who we are". The true-name is "who we seem". 
 Understand "are" as who we seem. 
 Understand "I am" as who we seem. 
 It mentions yourself.
 The comment is "'Slango,' you say. 'Lena gave me a totally unwanted visual about your yaklike proportions. Guess you also got a yak's sense of clock time?'".
 The response is "'It was an emergency. I figured you'd go to Lena, and I was right.'[queue whether we can leave now]

'You were lucky. I knew her a little, but I had no idea you two were making the yak with two humps.'

'No such thing as a bactrian yak,' Slango replies. 'My apologies. I assumed that what Brock knows, he passes on to you, and he certainly knows about me and Lena.' He scowls into his root beer. 'Nearly gave himself a hernia laughing,' Slango adds under his breath.".
 It quip-supplies Slango.
 The proper scene is consulting-Slango.

After laughing when the current interlocutor is Slango and the current quip is who we seem:

 It mentions Lena.
 The response is "'She's thirty-two,' says Slango crisply. 'She runs Radio Free Atlantida single-handed with electronics she built herself. And if she [i]were[/i] old enough to be my spinster aunt, that would still be my business.'

Section 4 - Lena

The as is a thing. The description of the as is "[one of]It appears to be an as, a [or]A [stopping]Roman coin of very low denomination[one of]. (Your knowledge, not mine. Should I ask how you know such things?)[or].[stopping] It is made of copper and has the letters S C stamped on one side." Understand "roman" or "coin" or "copper" as the as. The heft of the as is 1.

Instead of searching or looking under the as:

'Is that a board game?'[or]'Maybe a Slango is a kind of juice drink?' she suggests.[or]'I have no idea what you're talking about,' she says. Stonewalling.[or]She just shrugs. We're going to have to convince her to trust us first, it appears. How unutterably tedious.[stopping]".
	
Instead of saying goodbye to Lena when whether she hath seen slango is available and Lena knows trust-me:
	say "No, don't! I'm [i]sure[/i] she's about to tell us where Slango's gotten to, and if you've forgotten about getting off this island, I have not."

 It mentions Slango.
 The response is "'Slango and I were catching up. Bless that man, he's hung like a yak,' she says. 'But he got bad news and had to hurry back to the yacht. Said something about not being able to keep an appointment. I take it you're the appointment? I can try reaching him for you, if you want.'".

'But since you're here, whoever you are, I wonder whether you'd like to have a look at some merchandise of mine that could use a spruce.' [paragraph break]Aha.

 It quip-supplies Lena.

offer-contraband is an NPC-directed quip.
	The response is "Lena goes off into a corner and rummages among the suspicious piles of books, and uncovers a box. 'C'mere,' she says; and obediently I wander over to that area of the store, which incidentally happens to be tucked away and half-hidden by shelves.
	
'[prepare contraband]See here,' she says. 'See what you can do with it, eh?'"

Section 5 - Professor Brown

The greeting of professor brown is "He grunts."
The generic positive of professor brown is "yes".
The generic negative of professor brown is "no".
The generic confrontational of professor brown is "uh".

 what he seems doing is a questioning quip. 
 The printed name is "what he is doing". The true-name is "what he seems doing". 
 Understand "is" as what he seems doing. 
 It mentions research and Professor Brown.
 The comment is "'What are you up to there?' we ask. Asking Brown questions when he's working is a bit of a crap-shoot, I tell you now.".
 The response is "He wiggles his nose back and forth. I knew him for three months before I figured out what the wiggle is: it is his hands-free way of working his spectacles back up his nose when they start to slide down. [paragraph break]Without looking at us, he says, 'I'm getting ready to do a new calibration run on [']love['].' [paragraph break]This is a fav[our]ite of his, because you can get it so easily from a glove, so the materials are inexpensive.".
 It quip-supplies Professor Brown.

 what love looks like is a questioning quip. 
 It mentions research.
 The comment is "'What does love look like, then?' we ask, as though I hadn't seen this a bunch of times already.".
 The response is "[long love answer]".
 It quip-supplies Professor Brown.
 It indirectly-follows what he seems doing.

To say long love answer:
	say "'It varies,' Professor Brown replies. 'The manifestation of a complex concept depends on a variety of circumstances; by default if multiple concepts are available, the letter tool will produce whichever concept requires least energy to produce, but in cases where several concepts are indistinguishably popular, the results are apparently random. 

'Recent research suggests that the outcome can be influenced by the language community surrounding the operation and even by the intention of the tool's user (to a limited degree); but I am not interested in pursuing those angles at present.' [paragraph break]There: Professor Brown in a nutshell. Did he tell you anything you wanted to know? No.[paragraph break]";
	say "The deal is that manifestations of 'love' tend to look like stuff you'd find on a greeting card: roses, hearts, kiss symbols. Every once in a while you get something a little more platonic. But it's a let-down, if you want to know the truth. Most significant abstracts are like that: all you get by reifying them is a popular visual[ization]. "

 what he thinks of Higgate is a questioning quip. 
 It mentions Professor Higgate.
 The comment is "'What do you think of Professor Higgate?' we ask..".
 The response is "He gives a convulsive jerk of the shoulders. 'She's okay,' he says. 'She comes down here a lot and she keeps trying to get me to join her Conversational Lojban Tea, and I don't much see the point of her research, but I don't hate her or anything.'".
 It quip-supplies Professor Brown.
 It is background-information.
	
 what he thinks of you is a questioning quip. 
 It mentions yourself.
 The comment is "'So... There's a guy who I think is a graduate student here [--] Matthew Rosehip? Do you know him?'".
 The response is "This startles Brown enough that he turns around and looks at us. There is a curiously wary look in his eyes, and it hits me: He's worried. [paragraph break]See, about a month ago I was down here talking to Brown and I let slip some general hints about what I've been working on, and I had the impression that for once he was listening. When I was done with the very rough outlines, he told me to be careful, really really careful [--] not just on the island, but in the outside world, too, because there were a lot of people who wouldn't want a plan like that to succeed. [paragraph break]'I know all the graduate students,' he replies, turning another knob until his equipment gives a high-pitched whine. There is no functional purpose to that knob, he confessed once, other than to make strangers and idiots think they're interrupting a dangerous test. 'I'm not supervising his research, if that's what you mean. His advisor is Professor Waterstone.'".
 It quip-supplies Professor Brown.
 It is background-information.

 what he thinks of Waterstone is a questioning quip. 
 It mentions Professor Waterstone.
 The comment is "'Do you get along with Professor Waterstone?' we ask.".
 The response is "He is silent for a minute. Then he says, 'Once Professor Waterstone gave me a conch shell. He said I could s-remove it and settle the dispute about the afterlife once and for all.' 

This is not an anecdote I've heard before, but that sounds like a typically Waterstonian way of sending someone to blazes. 'What did you say?' I make us ask.

'I pointed out that in the phrase [']conch shell['], [']conch['] is a strongly-adhering adjective, so that actually you can't make a conch shell into much of anything, and moreover that reifications merely represent an amalgam of the most common beliefs about an abstract, rather than having any essential truth value.'

Brown sniffs. 'He didn't have a come-back to that.'".
 It quip-supplies Professor Brown.
 It is background-information.

why Waterstone gave him the conch shell is a questioning quip. 
 It mentions Professor Waterstone.
 The comment is "'Do you have any idea why Professor Waterstone, er, offered you the conch shell?'".
 The response is "Brown twitches. 'I was just in his office talking to him. Suddenly he got testy and sarcastic and gave me the shell. Some of the department here don't have very good people skills.'".
 It quip-supplies Professor Brown.
 It indirectly-follows what he thinks of Waterstone.

 what Professor Brown thinks of the academic job market is a questioning quip. 
 Understand "he" as what Professor Brown thinks of the academic job market.
 It mentions Employment.
 The comment is "'How is the job search going?' we ask. 'Are you still considering moving?'".
 The response is "He looks confused, so I have us hastily add, 'I heard from one of the graduate students that you were on the market.' [paragraph break]'Yes well,' he replies, in a tortoise-like voice you have heard often before. 'Under recent circumstances it is unlikely that I would receive a visa to work elsewhere. Nonetheless, I do send out the applications every fall, just in case the contract does not get renewed. Sometimes I even get a telephone interview or two.'".
 It quip-supplies Professor Brown.
 It is background-information.

 wish Professor Brown luck is a performative quip.
 Understand "wish him luck" as wish Professor Brown luck.
 It mentions employment, Professor Brown.
 The comment is "'Well, good luck with that.'".
 The response is "'At this point I need some kind of major change in the universe more than I need lu[--]' He stops and stares into the middle distance through the green spectacles. Then he bends over the work table and scribbles something in tiny writing on one of the scraps of paper there. [paragraph break]'Sorry!' he says. 'Had a thought.'".
 It quip-supplies Professor Brown.
 It directly-follows what Professor Brown thinks of the academic job market.

 how Professor Brown makes abstracts is a questioning quip.  
 Understand "he" as how Professor Brown makes abstracts.
 It mentions research.
 The comment is "'What equipment do you use to make your abstracts?' we ask.".
 The response is "'It's an ordinary letter-remover with a few adjustments,' Brown says. 'The department's computer can lift some of the legal overrides on standard letter tools. The job would be easier if I had access to higher-powered machinery, but...'".
 It quip-supplies Professor Brown.
 It indirectly-follows what he seems doing.

whether he can fix the letter-remover is a demonstration quip.
 It mentions the letter-remover.
 The comment is "'Could you fix my letter-remover to make abstract objects as well?'"
 The response is "'It's not difficult, you just[--] oh, stay here, I'm not supposed to bring students into the rectification room.' 

He takes the letter-remover and steps out into the hallway. I can hear him using his keycard on the door, going into the little room west of the hallway, doing something there. (Don't bother thinking we're going to cosh him and take the keycard. I'm sure there's a better way, and I don't cosh people.)

He comes back in a minute.

 The comment is "[one of]'Is there anything else that could be done to upgrade my letter-remover?' we ask naively.[or]'Anything else I should know about the letter-remover?' we ask.[stopping]".
 The response is "[one of]'Nothing I can help you with, I'm afraid,' he says. 'There are some safety overrides that could be programmed out, allowing you to make living creatures, but that's...' He does his spasmodic shrug. 'One of those things where I think the laws have a point. It's dangerous and possibly even cruel.'[or]'That's as good as I can make it for you,' he says. 'As I said, I think the law is right to prohibit living creatures.'[stopping]".
 It quip-supplies Professor Brown.
 It is repeatable.

 Understand "is" as why reifying living creatures seems cruel.  The comment is "'Why would it be cruel to make a living creature?' you ask.".
 It mentions letter-remover.
 The response is "'We don't know whether such creations have awareness and sensation like other creatures,' he says. 'If they do, it is horrible to bring them into existence only to send them out again.'".

 It quip-supplies Professor Brown.

what he thinks about the pasts is a demonstration quip.
 It mentions the pasts.
 The comment is "We demonstrate the pasts."
 The response is "'Yes,' says Brown, interested. 'This is good, very nice example of how an object can be affected by the creator and local environment. It appears to be a record of your own behavi[our] alone, but with the right laboratory conditions it ought to be possible to produce a past abstract referring to someone else, or to a place.'"

Section 6 - Professor Higgate

[ The professors were perhaps the easiest and most enjoyable characters to write. There are elements of caricature about each -- just as with the backpacking girl at the hostel -- but they're much more important figures in the plot and in Alex's life.

Professor Higgate is my favorite: genuinely and deeply committed to her subject, fond of her students, and so deeply part of her own academic culture that it's not always easy for her to see things as the world outside might. She's humane and well-meaning, she sees the pursuit of knowledge as a true and worthy calling in its own right, and yet she doesn't always understand what is happening to the world outside her doors, and that's what makes her defenseless in the end.

Higgate's dearness (to me) made her an obvious sacrificial candidate for the end of Act 3. I wanted to have something happen that would alarm Alex and make him feel that his world was under a true threat -- something more personal than the repressive but basically anonymous protest scene at the Roundabout. And the person Alex cares about most in an uncomplicated way is Higgate: she's supported and guided him through his career, almost another parent, except without the slightly stifling associations that his actual parents bring to bear. ]

The generic positive of Professor Higgate is "I suppose".
The generic negative of Professor Higgate is "[one of]not exactly[or]not really[at random]".
The generic adversative of Professor Higgate is "erm".
The generic confrontational of Professor Higgate is "er".

lojban-greeting is an NPC-directed quip. 
	The response is "She looks up when we come in. '.i xu do se bangu la lojban.' Higgate asks. She's asking whether we speak Lojban. For the present, I think it will raise fewer questions if we say no.".
	It is restrictive.
	
	
english-greeting is an NPC-directed quip.
	The response is "[one of]'Hello again,' says Higgate, obviously disappointed to see another non-Lojban speaker.[or]'You're back,' Higgate says[one of] flatly[or], putting aside her novel[or][at random].[stopping]".
	
Every turn when the current quip is lojban-greeting:
	say "Higgate is still looking at us expectantly, so I jump in. ";
	try discussing that we do not speak Lojban;
	try Higgate discussing that we do not speak Lojban.
	
Instead of saying no when that we do not speak lojban is available:
	try discussing that we do not.
	
Instead of saying yes when that we do not speak lojban is available:
	say "I could, of course, but she'd then wonder where we picked it up. Better not.";

 It mentions Professor Higgate.
 The comment is "'How are you?' we ask. 

Forgive me these irrelevant questions, but I haven't seen Professor Higgate for a few days, and she's one of my fav[our]ite people in the department. I worry about her a little.".
 The response is "She looks taken aback, as though trying to figure out whether she knows us. Then she shrugs this off and decides to proceed as though she does. 

'Oh, you know,' she says. 'It's that time of year when the energy's run out and the students have to be prodded with an electric rod to get them to do any work. And then I've got this book I've got to write, and Professor Waterstone keeps talking about how next year he would like to take a break from being Director of Graduate Studies...'".

 It indirectly-follows that we do not speak Lojban.

 what would be so bad about directing graduate studies is a questioning quip.

 The response is "'Nothing, nothing! It's just that I have this book I should be writing, and Professor Waterstone has done the job for so many years that he's[--]' 

She pulls up short, apparently remembering that she doesn't, actually, know us at all. 'He's very experienced, and I am not sure he would enjoy watching someone else do it differently,' she concludes tactfully. 'Our personal styles are not very similar.'".

 what the romance novel might be is a questioning quip. 
 It mentions heart to heart.
 The comment is "'What are you reading there?' we ask, in our best earnest undergraduate voice.".
 The response is "She blushes very faintly. 'It's a novel in Láadan,' she says. 'A relatively little-spoken language, but I'm trying to master it. It was designed as a language for women, which has interesting sociological implications, though I fear it was not as widely taken up as the designer might have hoped.'".
 It quip-supplies Professor Higgate.
It is background-information.

[Originally the novel was in Fukhian, which I picked off a webpage on constructed languages because I liked the look of the script. But later, reading Arika Okrent's In the Land of Invented Languages as research, I ran across Láadan, which — with its highly elaborated vocabulary of body parts, and the sentence modifiers that mean things like 'I say the following in a loving fashion' — seemed a more likely language for constructed romance novels.]

whether Professor Higgate would translate part of the novel is a questioning quip. 
 Understand "she" or "if" as whether Professor Higgate would translate part of the novel.
 It mentions constructed language, heart to heart.
 The comment is "'Would you translate part of it for me?' we ask.".
 The response is "The blush deepens. 'Well, some of the ideas are hard to express in single words of English. This suffix, for instance, has a pejorative meaning, so when it is attached to, ah, the word for experiencing a sexual act, that may suggest that the act was unsatisfactory.'".
 It quip-supplies Professor Higgate.
 It directly-follows what the romance novel might be.

 whether she encountered activists is a questioning quip.

 The comment is "'Did you by any chance encounter some activists on the way into the building?' we ask. 'I had a hard time getting in here because they wanted to talk to me about toxi waste.'".
 The response is "'[i]Yes[/i],' she says. 'Now those kids! If we needed proof of the social value of what we're doing here, they're a perfect example. I admire their enthusiasm, don't get me wrong, but the whole idea of single-term manipulation is hopelessly wrong-headed, and if they spent a semester or two in a Language Studies class, they'd understand why.'".

 It mentions seminar door, key.
 The response is "'Er... Do you have some student ID or something? You see, and this is a little embarrassing, I'm afraid I'm not quite placing you at the moment, and I'm not supposed to allow students into that room unless they have some affiliation with the department.' 

Of course we don't have any ID, and no prospect of getting any. But she might be persuaded by some other evidence of affiliation[if the player does not enclose the Problem of Adjectives]. Maybe a book to return[end if].".

[From early on in the game, PAINT was an available object, since it's very linguistically productive, offering PANT, PINT, PIN, PAN, PAT, etc. At one point, the player got this paint from Professor Higgate's office, a remnant of the redecoration in progress there.

But ultimately, PAINT didn't fit too well into the puzzle structure I was building, and many of the things it offered could be created from other objects sooner or later. So I cut the object and commented out the associated dialogue passages.]

Section 8  - Brock

[ Brock underwent several major character revisions over the course of development. Rescuing him was always a major goal of the game (though in earlier versions, the goal was to rescue him from inside the Customs House, where he'd been captured trying to escape through the standard channels). 

In the first draft, he was a love interest for Andra but one whose feelings for her were still undeclared. But as I wrote, that scenario began to feel increasingly childish and contrived. Here were two adults who had been living together in very close quarters for years. Imagining that their feelings had somehow gone unspoken and unexplored required that they either be people with major hangups about love and relationships, or that they conform to that television logic that dictates that people will postpone starting any new relationship until right at the end of the story, even when they've been perfect for one another for all seven seasons. 

So I decided to revise.

Next I recast Brock as a significantly less-nice figure, one who mildly harassed Andra and bossed her around without having any genuinely romantic feelings for her. In this version, Andra was motivated almost as strongly as Alex by a sense of being trapped in circumstances, unable to do what she wanted to do or be who she wanted to be. Though she felt bound by duty and circumstance to help rescue Brock, she was really very angry at him. The dynamic here was about Andra's need to develop a more assertive sense of self, against the background of a domineering family and a present-day environment in which she was used and taken for granted.

But as I worked on this, I started to feel that I'd made Andra too unsympathetic as a character: bullied by her family and then her colleagues, she was a resentful survivor. But there wasn't really enough time in the story to explore her struggle to define herself, so what came across was mostly someone embittered and miserable. We rarely saw any indication of warm feelings from her, and the dialogue written from 'her' voice tended to be anodyne and devoid of personality, or just plain sour. 

In light of that, I decided to revise Brock yet again. While I'd still like to write a story like the one I originally envisioned for Andra, there isn't room for that story to be inside Counterfeit Monkey. Instead, I made Brock a cocky character but one that Andra does love and with whom she has a history. I added the various memories about their relationship, to establish that they've grown together and that Brock helped Andra through some weird stuff.

That puts a lot of weight on this one scene. Though we've heard from and about Brock all game long, we never meet him until now, and we won't be allowed to interact with him again until the denouement. Moreover, we've just come through a somewhat tense and very linear passage. So the goals here are:

-- provide a less-linear gameplay sequence in which the player has several simple challenges doable in any order, something that feels like a relaxing oasis between the tense bureau entry and the even-tenser conflict with Alex's father
-- sketch in as rapidly as possible the emotional landscape between Brock and Andra: mutual affection and respect, some joking around, and a few not-too-buried resentments on Andra's part about the trouble he's caused -- though their relationship is healthy enough that she can bring those up without spiking the whole thing
-- present Brock as a fairly playful figure who reacts to a number of the things Andra does in his presence, so that even the mechanical puzzle-solving bits feel a bit expressive and communicative
-- let Brock earn a little of the player's goodwill (as well as Andra's) by having him be actively helpful -- turning up props to use, getting things out of the t-inserter when they're in our way, and so on. This is a fine line to walk, because we don't really want Brock to actually solve the puzzles for us, certainly not before the player has had a chance to do so
-- to make Brock seem sufficiently human, present, and likeable that the choice about whether to betray him seems like a genuine concern
]

Brock is a man in the repository. "Brock is preternaturally still.". The current mood of Brock is neutral.

Brock is alert. The description of Brock is "He looks a bit haggard to me, but I don't think anything too horrible has happened to him[one of]. So perhaps you can stop worrying[or][stopping]."

Brock-argument is a scene. Brock-argument begins when the location is the Equipment Testing Room and Brock is in the location.


When Brock-argument begins:
	if the location does not enclose an it-derivative:
		now Brock carries the last-sign.
	
Definition: a thing is it-derivative:
	if it is the spill or it is the pita or it is the piece or it is a sign:
		yes;
	if it is proffered by the spill or it is proffered by the pita or it is proffered by the piece or it is proffered by a sign:
		yes;
	no.

Brock-argument ends when Brock is not in the location.

Before inserting something into the t-inserter when Brock is in the location and the t-inserter contains something (called target):
	say "'[one of]Here, [the target] [is-are] in your way[or]Let me get that for you[or]Here[or]I've got that[at random].' [run paragraph on]";
	try Brock taking the target;
	if Brock is carrying the target:
		try Brock dropping the target.
	
Report Brock taking something:
	say "Brock fishes [the noun] out of the T-inserter. [run paragraph on]" instead.
	
Report Brock dropping something:
	say "He tosses [it-them of the noun] in the corner." instead.

[run paragraph on]".

Report Brock saying hello to the player for the first time:  
	now the player knows brock-found;
	complete "Find Brock";
	assign "Test T-inserter on making creatures" at Sensitive Equipment Testing Room;
	assign "Test T-inserter on making abstracts" at Sensitive Equipment Testing Room;
	assign "Test T-inserter on situations where it could build more than one thing" at Sensitive Equipment Testing Room;

You start to object, but I say, 'Yes, you'd better return to petrified form.' You know I'm right. He'll be easier to carry.

I could have stood for our previous meeting to be the last one [--] we had dinner and she hugged me goodbye then. This makes it all much much worse.

And you, you're nattering at me in our head, asking what she meant about the Bureau. It might be, I guess, that they've been watching me and that she got wind of it. That would be likely. But if so it doesn't matter, not any more.

'If it is Alex who comes back out, I can't possibly save your university career, but we might be able to make a case for clemency.' What he means by that[--] oh. Yes. I understand now.

He gives us a hard shove. We're half inside the room when we hear his last remark:

	The response is "'Don't move, Alexandra, or I'll split you in two.'
	
A very tall woman with Bureau-blue eyes steps into the room from the east, carrying [a restoration-gel rifle]. Her face is ageless, her mouth full-lipped but proud.

gel-shot is an NPC-directed quip.
	The response is "She fires again. The pellet hits us, cold and hard, in the shoulder. It stings like hell and for a moment I think our clavicle is broken. [You] put our hand over the wounded spot.
	
Our hand.

Atlantida lowers the rifle, surprised. 'Fused,' she says. 'Isn't that interesting. And so recently, too. If the gel rifle won't separate you, nothing will.' She smiles, not warmly. 'Pity. You would have been easier to deal with separately. Cold Storage for Andra, house arrest for Alex.'"
	It quip-supplies atlantida-woman.
	
summoning-guards is an NPC-directed quip.
	The response is "[if the restoration-gel rifle is visible and the restoration-gel rifle is not carried by Atlantida-woman]Atlantida real[ize]s that [the restoration-gel rifle] is now a couple of me[ter]s away from her. [otherwise]'And now it's time for you to go,' Atlantida says. [end if]

She presses a button on something in her hand. Far away, a high-pitched bell rings.
	
'Did you have anything else you wanted to ask me? I so rarely get to talk with ordinary citizens. Only ones with clearance, and those about to go into Cold Storage. A last interview with Saint Peter.'"

Instead of saying yes when the player carries the restoration-gel rifle and the current quip is summoning-guards:
	say "'Oh, I have lots of questions,' [you] say.";
	try shooting atlantida with the restoration-gel rifle.
	
Instead of saying no when the player carries the restoration-gel rifle and the current quip is summoning-guards:
	say "'Not really,' [you] say.";
	try shooting atlantida with the restoration-gel rifle.
	
not-long-now is an NPC-directed quip.
	The response is "'I see,' says Atlantida. 'You have the rifle. Clever, but do think. You might do some damage with that thing, but you won't escape. So why hurt anyone unnecessarily?'"

Waiting for guards is a scene. Waiting for guards begins when atlantida-woman recollects summoning-guards.

Waiting for guards ends in capture when the time since waiting for guards began is 2 minutes.

Report waiting during waiting for guards:

Waiting for guards ends in diversion when atlantida-woman is not visible.

When waiting for guards ends in capture:
	say "There are noises in the next room, and a moment later a couple of All-Purpose Officers burst into the room, gel rifles and real rifles drawn. 

'You're slow,' Atlantida says, seating herself on the ridiculous bed. 'I thought we had trained for this eventuality.'

Before shooting the atlantida-woman with the rifle:

'Maybe it's time,' I say. 'Maybe part of the business of democracy is having the arguments[--]' 

You don't let me finish. [run paragraph on]"


Instead of showing something to Atlantida-woman:
	say "You know better than to give away any unnecessary information, any advantage."

Rule for quip-introducing how fusion happens:
	say "Fused? We should be two pieces by now. Maybe she has an explanation? But you seem to be focused on her gun hand. How can you be so calm?";

'Forced into a choice [if the library message person is second person]he[otherwise]she[end if] would never have made on [if the library message person is second person]his[otherwise]her[end if] own. Impossible to separate because you aren't two whole people any more.'".
 It quip-supplies Atlantida-woman.
 It directly-follows gel-shot. 
	
thing-about-democracy is an NPC-directed quip.
	The response is "Atlantida smiles with half a mouth. 'You've arrived on a difficult day. In the ordinary course of things, I keep things quiet: the spirit of democracy, but none of the sordid wrangling and bribes and corruption and compromise. It's only when the spirit of the island itself is threatened, that we have to resort to such extreme measures[casually queue more-about-democracy][if the infertile astrologer is visible].'

The infertile astrologer sidles closer to us, smiling and making hand signs that I think are supposed to represent Aries. Old bat.[otherwise].'[end if]"

Instead of putting restoration gel on the infertile astrologer when Atlantida-woman does not recollect thing-about-democracy:
	say "The astrologer is still a little too far away to reach. She's moving towards us, though. If we wait, perhaps..."

more-about-democracy is an NPC-directed quip.
	The response is "'Do you think the protesters would feel happier if there had been a citizen referendum where their position had been voted down? The outcome would have been just the same, but they would feel much more responsible for it; surely an unpleasant position for them to be in, considering their moral objections.'"
	 

whether the protesters feel the same way is a questioning quip. The comment is "'What about the protesters?' [you] ask. 'They don't like your policy. Are you sure you're really representing the spirit of Atlantis, or have you gone some other way of your own?'".
 It mentions security, bureau.
 The response is "Atlantida shrugs off our question. 'A vocal minority. Most people are content to keep what they have. Imagine the chaos if everyone had free access to the Bureau's complete range of letter tools, and if there were no laws about how to use them[casually queue more-about-democracy].'".
 It quip-supplies Atlantida-woman.
 It directly-follows thing-about-democracy.
Understand "if" as whether the protesters feel the same way.

Instead of throwing the tub at the Atlantida-woman:
	say "We fling the tub at her. Unfortunately, the gel is sticky enough that it doesn't, as I had sort of hoped, spill out all over her. She dodges, then hurls it back at us [--] and she has better aim[casually queue anti-gel comment]."

Instead of going somewhere in the presence of Atlantida-woman:
	say "'I don't think so,' says Atlantida. As she's physically about twice our mass, I think she'll win this one."
	
Every turn when atlantida-woman is carrying something (called target) which is not the restoration-gel rifle:
	try Atlantida-woman dropping the target.
	
Report atlantida-woman dropping the infertile astrologer:

anti-gel comment is an NPC-directed quip.
	The response is "'Oh, no, my dear,' Atlantida says. 'They could remake me, but it wouldn't be the [i]same[/i] me, would it? It would be some new construct. The Atlantida of today. And that's not the way to a consistent policy, is it?'"

 It quip-supplies Atlantida-woman.

how she justifies cold storage is an unlisted questioning quip. The comment is "'How do you excuse putting people in Cold Storage? It's a human rights violation.'".
 It mentions crime, legislation.
 The response is "Atlantida makes a motion as though brushing away an insect. 'The laws of Atlantis are special. They keep us strong; they keep the rest of the world safe.'".
 It quip-supplies Atlantida-woman.

The printed name of atlantida-refreshed is "Atlantida". Understand "atlantida" as atlantida-refreshed.

	The comment is "'The two of us, Alex and Andra, we seem to be stuck together permanently. You don't happen to know how to remove our fusion?'"
	The response is "She shakes her head. 'We've never found a way to undo that effect completely,' she says. 'I'm sorry. But try to listen to both your voices. One may be the weaker now, but if you try to kill that self entirely, it tends to cause a severe mental illness.'"
	It quip-supplies atlantida-refreshed.

Carry out going to the Surveillance Room during Atlantida-shooing: 
	now Atlantida-refreshed is in the Surveillance Room;
	if the player is staid:
		say "Atlantida follows, looking around sharply. Her expression when she sees the computers and television screens is wry, but she doesn't say anything. No time now, perhaps."

Carry out going to the Tunnel during Atlantida-shooing: 
	now Atlantida-refreshed is in the Tunnel;
	if the player is staid:
		say "Atlantida accompanies us, close on our heels in the narrow space."

Carry out going to the Personal Apartment during Atlantida-shooing: 
	now Atlantida-refreshed is in the Personal Apartment;
	if the player is staid:
		say "Atlantida comes along with us."
		
Carry out going to the Private Solarium when Atlantida-shooing is happening or Portcullis-breaking is happening:
	now Atlantida-refreshed is in the Private Solarium;
	if the player is staid:
		say "She follows. 'Go, go,' she says. 'You've done good work today. Atlantis is grateful.'"
		
Carry out going through the tall window:
	now the tall window is closed;
	now the tall window is locked;
	if Atlantida-refreshed is in the Private Solarium:
		say "As soon as we're through, Atlantida closes the window behind us, and we hear it lock. No evidence that we came through here, now.";
	otherwise:
		say "[You] close the window behind us.";

Portcullis-threat is a scene. Portcullis-threat begins when Atlantida-shooing ends. Portcullis-threat ends in delay when the portcullis is closed. Portcullis-threat ends in capture when the time since Portcullis-threat began is 4 minutes.
	
When Portcullis-threat begins:
	say "Someone is coming into the workshop upstairs. There's at most a few seconds before they'll be down the tunnel.";

When Portcullis-threat ends in capture:
	say "The guards arrive. [You] [are] captured and taken away for interrogation, and it's some time before Atlantida is able to arrange for our release.";
	end the story saying "That could have gone better"
	
When Portcullis-threat ends in delay:
	say "The portcullis should at least slow down anyone coming after us. Though that's only moderately comforting."
	
Portcullis-breaking is a scene. Portcullis-breaking begins when Portcullis-threat ends in delay.

Portcullis-breaking ends in stupidity when the portcullis is open. Portcullis-breaking ends in final-threat when the location is the Solarium.

When Portcullis-breaking ends in stupidity:
	say "Reopening the portcullis turns out to have been a poor idea, because it means there's nothing to delay the guards storming down from above. [You] [are] captured and taken away for interrogation, and it's some time before Atlantida is able to arrange for our release.";
	end the story saying "That could have gone better"

When Portcullis-breaking ends in final-threat:
	say "From the other room, the noises make it sound as though someone is using a metal torch to dismantle the portcullis bar by bar."; 

Guard-capture is a scene. Guard-capture begins when Portcullis-breaking ends in final-threat. Guard-capture ends in capture when the time since Guard-capture began is 5 minutes.

Guard-capture ends in freedom when the location is Precarious Perch.

When Guard-capture ends in capture:
	say "Despite the admonishments of the new Atlantida, the Bureau officers who get through the door are not inclined to stop and chat. 
	
[You] [are] captured and taken away for interrogation, and it's some time before Atlantida is able to arrange for our release.";
	end the story saying "That could have gone better"


Volume 7 - Hint System

[ Once there were going to be hints. Then I realized just how much insanity that implied, given the many different solution paths. There was no chance of automating this the way Bronze does; and for that matter, just checking whether the player has an object that could be used to solve a given puzzle could be very hard. So I wussed out. ]

Chapter 1 - Hint Vocabulary

Understand "hint about [something]" or "think about [something]" as requesting hint about. Requesting hint about is an action out of world applying to one thing.

Sanity-check requesting hint about something:
	say "What, in hard mode? Really." instead.

Report requesting hint about something:
	say "Beats me, honestly."
	 

Chapter 2 - Hints for Reusable Items and Tools

Report requesting hint about the player:
	say "Each of us is perhaps a bit of a puzzle to the other, it's true. But we've only got to share this body for a few hours, right?" instead.
	
Report requesting hint about the letter-remover:
	say "This is a highly useful multi-purpose device, which we're going to need many times in order to get off this island, I'm guessing. We can set it to a particular letter and wave it at things — or, as a shortcut, just WAVE A-REMOVER AT COAT, for instance." instead.
	
Report requesting hint about the homonym paddle:
	say "The homonym paddle transforms any object into another object with the same name. We're not going to succeed in stealing it from the bartender, but in many cases she may be willing to make the transformation for us, if we show things to her." instead.
	
Report requesting hint about the t-inserter machine:
	say "Putting items into the T-inserter will add the letter T to them — in some cases, multiple Ts." instead.
	
Report requesting hint about the synthesizer:
	say "To synthesize two objects, we need to place both inside the synthesizer (so very large items may not fit), then turn the synthesizer on." instead.
	
Report requesting hint about the backpack:
	say "We carry things around in it, and of course it's a useful place to stash items that we might not want someone to notice on us at first glance." instead.
	
Report requesting hint about the monocle:
	say "The chief advantage of the monocle is that it lets us see what an item used to be before it underwent letter transformation (if it did). That works almost all of the time, unless someone has used Origin Paste on the item. But Origin Paste isn't that easy to come by." instead.
	
Report requesting hint about the authentication scope:
	say "The scope works like my monocle: it allows the secretary to detect items that were forged." instead.
	
Report requesting hint about the origin paste:
	say "RUB paste on something in order to disguise it from monocles and authentication scopes. It'll leave behind the scent of lavender for a little while, but sometimes, especially in outdoor or busy environments, people won't notice the scent. 
	
(And, incidentally, there's plenty of paste, so I doubt we should concern ourselves with the possibility of running out.)" instead.

Report requesting hint about the restoration gel:
	say "Think of this as a gigantic eraser for any mistakes we might make. It reverts any letter-changed items back to their original form, so if we create the wrong object or just want to retrieve the original, we can do so." instead.
	
Report requesting hint about the flash drive:
	say "This is full of my plans and schemes, and while I have every hope that it's going to be very very useful in the outside world, there's nothing in there that will help us with our escape. Just hanging onto it and getting off the island alive would meet my expectations, as far as the flash drive is concerned." instead.
	
Report requesting hint about the bills:
	say "There's enough money here to supply us anything we need to buy between now and the point where we get off the island." instead.

Report requesting hint about the plans:
	say "Personally, I don't care much about the plans at all, but they're evidently of considerable value to you, assuming you can get them off the island and into the hands of your prospective buyers. Between now and then, they're more of a liability than an asset." instead.
	
Report requesting hint about the restoration-gel rifle:
	say "This works like regular restoration gel, with the signal exception that it can act at a distance. SHOOT the rifle at things in order to restore them to their original letter form." instead.

Report requesting hint about the Britishizing goggles:
	say "I think they were a bit of a white elephant purchase on your part. I can't see what good they're ever going to do us." instead.

Report requesting hint about the Catalan punt volat needle:
	say "I can't think of any reason why that would ever be useful to us." instead.
	
Report requesting hint about the programmable dais:
	say "It looks to me as though this can do the functions of a synthes[ize]r and of a homonym paddle — and possibly also get around some of the size and power restrictions we've faced with earlier tools. Switching the switch will swap over from one function to the other." instead.

Report requesting hint about the spinner:
	if the spinner-gate is locked:
		say "[one of]If we put something on the spinner, it rotates the letters of the word to appear backwards[or]It seems that successfully rotating something on the spinner has the secondary effect of unlocking the gate[or]We will need something whose letters form a word when reversed as well[or]Buying a yam from the farmer's stall might give us the equipment we need[or]GO TO HESYCHIUS, then BUY YAM, then PUT YAM ON SPINNER[stopping]." instead;
	else:
		say "We've already unlocked the gate, but we can still use the spinner to rotate other words if we like." instead.

Chapter 3 - Hints about Useless Scenery

Report requesting hint about an unlocked door:
	say "[The noun] is unlocked, which seems sufficient for the time being." instead.
	
Report requesting hint about a scenery container:
	if something is in the noun:
		say "The only interesting thing about [the noun] is that [it-they] contain[s] [a list of things in the noun]." instead;
	say "I don't think [the noun] is likely to be of great significance to us, unless there's something useful inside." instead.
	
Report requesting hint about a scenery thing:
	say "[The noun] [is-are] too large to be converted into anything with the letter tools at our disposal, I think." instead. 
	
Report requesting hint about the altar:
	say "[one of]It is going to take something other than prayer to get us out of here[or]I don't think there's anything useful we can do with the altar[or]There might be something minorly amusing to do with the altar, but it won't solve any of our problems[stopping]." instead.
	
Report requesting hint about the customs house:
	say "The customs house is only useful for people who are leaving the island. The less we have to do with it before then, the better." instead.

Report requesting hint about a screen which is part of something (called the parent computer): 
	say "[The noun] [is-are] just there to let us read the output of [the parent computer]." instead.

Report requesting hint about portholes:
	say "[The noun] [is-are] only there to let in the light. I don't think we can use [it-them] for anything." instead.
	
Report requesting hint about a drain:
	say "[The noun] [is-are] an ordinary part of the plumbling here, but not terribly important." instead. 

Report requesting hint about a blanket:
	say "[The noun] [is-are]n't likely to be a lot of help to us." instead.
	
Report requesting hint about some sheets:
	say "[The noun] [is-are]n't likely to be a lot of help to us." instead.
	
Report requesting hint about a pillow:
	say "[The noun] [is-are]n't likely to be a lot of help to us." instead.

[Report requesting hint about the desk-attendant:
	say "I don't think she can help us with much. She might be able to make a bit of conversation, but to be honest, the less of an impression we make on her, the better." instead.]

Report requesting hint about the gift shop volunteer:
	say "To me, he looks like a slightly bored old man. Chat with him if you want, but I don't think he's going to solve any major problems for us." instead.
	
Report requesting hint about the depluralizing cannon:
	say "If it weren't for this thing, Anglophone Atlantis wouldn't exist — not as an independent country, anyhow. That said, I don't think we're going to find a use for it ourselves, and that's just as well. Depluralizing people is typically considered a war crime." instead.

	say "[one of]The balance will tilt if the contents of one pan are lighter than those of the other.[or]We can't take anything out, but perhaps we could change what's already there.[or]The letter-remover would come in handy for this.[or]There are several different changes we could make.[or]We could try WAVE R-REMOVER AT PEAR.[stopping]" instead.
	
Report requesting hint about the ticket:
	if the cinema lobby is not visited:
		say "Most likely this will come in handy somewhere where we need a ticket." instead;

		say "We have already gotten past the ticket-taker." instead;

		say "This might be more useful back at the cinema lobby." instead;
	say "Giving the ticket to the ticket-taker would probably get us into the screening room." instead.

	otherwise say "We could get the ticket and give it to the ticket-taker.";
	stop the action.

		say "It's a tempting article, but honestly I don't see any way to reach the gun from here." instead;

[Running this one is a major, major undertaking, producing thousands of lines of transcript output to go through. But it turned up a huge number of small bugs and implementation gaps as well: items that weren't marked plural when they should have been, animals that weren't set to the correct class, objects that should have a strong smell or sound associated but didn't. 

Other errors discovered this way:

	— >KISS MOTHER originally produced the response "Tempting, but no," 
	— the Gengis Khan-style Tartar smelled like deodorant
	— so did the Victorian papa and papas
	— PUSH TOTS NORTH had a come-back about how pushing people in directions only worked on small children
	— the tamale description sort of hinted that the contents might be interesting, then didn't react if you searched it
	— all sorts of things could be waved that weren't really wave-worthy
	— the stopcock and petcock were both described as not something we can open/close, when they are in fact forms of valve
	— the rock ballad wasn't marked as abstract, so you could wave it and rub it and so on
	— it was possible to "play" other items like an instrument any time the oboe was in the same location

			say "[italic type]showing [item] to [the interviewee]: [roman type]";
			try showing the item to the interviewee.
			
[We use this to test whether appropriate rules are being followed about what can be worn simultaneously with what else.]

Understand "cycle wardrobe" as cycling wardrobe. Cycling wardrobe is an action out of world.

Carry out cycling wardrobe:
	repeat with item running through wearable things:
		move the item to the player;
		try wearing the item.
		
Understand "pound bold descriptions" as testing boldness.

Testing boldness is an action applying to nothing.

Carry out testing boldness: 
	now boldening is true;
	repeat with destination running through rooms:
		move player to destination.
			
Section 4 - Construction Tests

[ This section is of chiefly archaeological interest.

These commands were written not to verify behavior already in the game but to help identify things that could or should be implemented. 'list sources' identifies portable in-game objects that ought to be analyzed for their word derivatives. 

'pound anagrams' helped to work out which objects in the game were anagrams of which others, and is very slow because it was implemented before the hash code was in; but it only needed to run once. This was more of a viability test than anything else.

'list syntheses' was to help with brainstorming about what synthetic objects should be made, though it does not account for objects with interleaved letters (again, because it was implemented before the hash code was added).

Understand "list syntheses" as listing syntheses. Listing syntheses is an action out of world.



Carry out listing syntheses:
	repeat with item running through fake things:
		repeat with second item running through fake things:
			say "[item][second item][line break]";
		say line break.
	
Understand "pound anagrams" as testing anagrams. Testing anagrams is an action applying to nothing.

Carry out testing anagrams:
	repeat with item running through synthesizable things:
		hash item;
		say " - [item][line break]";

To hash (N - a thing):
	let anagram key be a list of indexed text;
	let starting form be indexed text;
	let starting form be "[n]";
	let count be the number of characters in starting form;
	repeat with i running from 1 to count:
		add "[character number i in starting form]" to anagram key;
	sort anagram key;
	say anagram key.

Understand "list sources" as listing sources. Listing sources is an action applying to nothing.

Carry out listing sources:
	repeat with item running through portable things which are not off-stage:
		if the item is not part of something:
			say "[item][line break]".
			
Understand "list easy outcomes" as listing easy outcomes. Listing easy outcomes is an action applying to nothing.

Carry out listing easy outcomes:
	repeat with item running through synthesizable things:
		say "[item]: [encryption of item][line break]".
			
Understand "list hard outcomes" as listing hard outcomes. Listing hard outcomes is an action applying to nothing.

Carry out listing hard outcomes:
	repeat with item running through synthesizable things:
		say "[item]: [hard encryption of item][line break]". 
			
Understand "list back outcomes" as listing back outcomes. Listing back outcomes is an action applying to nothing.

Carry out listing back outcomes:
	repeat with item running through synthesizable things:
		say "[item]: [back encryption of item][line break]". 
		

			
Understand "list all outcomes" as listing all outcomes. Listing all outcomes is an action applying to nothing.

Carry out listing all outcomes:
	repeat with item running through synthesizable things:
		say "[item]: [encryption of item], [back encryption of item], [hard encryption of item], [back hard encryption of item][line break]". 


[The list length thing was added because I was investigating a different puzzle style -- one in which the player needed to make a word-object with specific characteristics such as length and consonant/vowel pattern, which would then function as a key in a particular type of Bureau lock. This turned out to be hard to construct and boring to solve, so I scrapped the concept.]

Understand "list length [number]" as listing lengths. Listing lengths is an action applying to one number.

Carry out listing lengths:
	repeat with item running through portable things:
		let starting form be indexed text;
		let starting form be "[item]";
		let N be the number of characters in starting form;
		if N is the number understood:
			say "[item][line break]".
			
Understand "list anagram probables" as listing anagram probables. Listing anagram probables is an action applying to nothing.

Carry out listing anagram probables:
	repeat with item running through portable things which are not fixed in place:
		if item is in the quip-repository:
			next;
		if item is part of something which is fixed in place:
			next;
		if item is a person:
			next;
		let starting form be indexed text;
		let starting form be "[item]";
		let N be the number of characters in starting form;
		if N is greater than 8:
			say "[item][line break]".
