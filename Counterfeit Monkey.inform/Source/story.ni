"Counterfeit Monkey" by Emily Short.


["The alphabet is a system of interchangeable parts. The word form can be surgically revised, instead of rewritten, to become the word farm or firm or fork or fort or from, or with a little more trouble, to become the word pineapple." -- Robert Bringhurst, The Elements of Typographic Style]

Chapter 1 - Bibliographical Data

Include (- Switches z; -) before "Other Configuration" in "Output.i6t".

The story headline is "A Removal".

The story description is "Anglophone Atlantis has been an independent nation since an April day in 1822, when a well-aimed shot from their depluralizing cannon reduced the British colonizing fleet to one ship.

Since then, Atlantis has been the world's greatest center for linguistic manipulation, designing letter inserters, word synthesizers, the diminutive affixer, and a host of other tools for converting one thing to another. Inventors worldwide pay heavily for that technology, which is where a smuggler and industrial espionage agent such as yourself can really clean up.

Unfortunately, the Bureau of Orthography has taken a serious interest in your activities lately. Your face has been recorded and your cover is blown.

Your remaining assets: about eight more hours of a national holiday that's spreading the police thin; the most inconvenient damn disguise you've ever worn in your life; and one full-alphabet letter remover.

Good luck getting off the island."

Release along with a file of "Customs Poster" called "Customs-Poster-Big.png", a file of "DCL Advertisement" called "DCLbig.png", a file of "Atlantida Poster" called "Atlantida.png", cover art, the library card, and a website.

Chapter 3 - Undo Handling

[Some interpreters do not allocate enough memory to allow Counterfeit Monkey to UNDO successfully after a turn has gone wrong. To make matters worse, sometimes UNDO stops working partway through a playthrough when it did work at the beginning.

Ultra Undo is an extension kindly written by Dannii Willis to use external file recording to ensure that UNDO remains available.]
