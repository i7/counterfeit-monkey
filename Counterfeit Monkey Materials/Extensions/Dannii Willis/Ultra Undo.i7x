"Handles undo using external files for very big story files"

Section - Tests

[ Test if the VM is able to perform an undo. This is necessary because Git won't tell us that it can't. ]

The Ultra Undo Test rule translates into I6 as "Ultra_Undo_Test".
The Ultra Undo Test rule is listed last in the startup rules.

[ Rerun the tests if we load a saved game. ]

Section (for use with Interpreter Sniffing by Friends of I7) 

The Ultra Undo Test rule is listed in the resniffing rules.

Ultra Undo ends here.

---- DOCUMENTATION ----

Some interpreters have limitations which mean that for very large story files the Undo function stops working. So far the only known example of this is Emily Short's Counterfeit Monkey, for which this extension was written. Ultra Undo will keep Undo working when the interpreter cannot, by using external files. You do not need to do anything other than include the extension - it will take care of everything for you, including cleaning up after itself (i.e., deleting those files when the player quits or restarts.)

There is a use option "maximum file based undo count" which controls how many how many turns can be undone using external files. By default that number is 10.

This extension is compatible with Conditional Undo by Jesse McGrew and Undo Output Control by Erik Temple.
