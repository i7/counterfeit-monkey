How it ends. What can I tell you about how it ends.

Sometime later, Atlantis changes, not just a little but very much
sometime later, it has not changed enough
sometime later, we all go to dinner with your parents and my parents and it is exceptionally strange, that meeting. Your parents are angry and sad that you've done something so unnatural, and my parents are not best pleased I'm one with a smuggler
Sometime later, we have our own graphic novel
Sometime later
