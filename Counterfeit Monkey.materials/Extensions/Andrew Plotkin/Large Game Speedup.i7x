Version 4/140731 of Large Game Speedup by Andrew Plotkin begins here.

"Performance improvements for games with several hundred objects."

Use authorial modesty.

Chapter - Miscellaneous Definitions

Use static object grouping translates as (- Constant STATIC_OBJECT_GROUPING; -). 

[These adjectives are much faster than "if nothing is in..." or "if the number of things in ... is zero". (Note that the Standard Rules do not define "empty" on containers and supporters; these adjectives are my invention.)]
Definition: a container is empty rather than non-empty if the first thing held by it is nothing.
Definition: a supporter is empty rather than non-empty if the first thing held by it is nothing.

Chapter - Table of Locale Priorities

Include (-
! Sort the first N rows of a table, rather than the whole thing. The rest
! of the table is untouched. Blank rows are sorted down to position N (not
! to the very end).
[ TableSortPartial tab rows col dir test_flag algorithm i j k f;
	for (i=1:i<=tab-->0:i++) {
		j = tab-->i; ! Address of column table
		if ((j-->1) & TB_COLUMN_DONTSORTME)
			return RunTimeProblem(RTP_TABLE_CANTSORT, tab);
	}
	if (col >= 100) col=TableFindCol(tab, col, false);
	k = rows; ! Not the entire table
	k = TableMoveBlanksToBack(tab, 1, k);
	if (test_flag) {
		print "After moving blanks to back:^"; TableColumnDebug(tab, col);
	}

	SetSortDomain(TableSwapRows, TableCompareRows);
	SortArray(tab, col, dir, k, test_flag, algorithm);

	if (test_flag) {
		print "Final state:^"; TableColumnDebug(tab, col);
	}
];
-) after "Sort" in "Tables.i6t".

To sort (T - table name) up to row (N - number) in (TC - table column) order
        (documented at ph_sortcolumn):
        (- TableSortPartial({T}, {N}, {TC}, 1); -).

[We have to clear these flags for every thing. It's worth having a routine that skips I7's usual SetEitherOrProperty() mechanism and all its safety checks.]
To rapidly set all things not mentioned: (- OptimizedAllThingsUnsetMentioned(); -).
To rapidly set all things not marked for listing: (- OptimizedAllThingsUnsetWorkflag(); -).

Include (-
[ OptimizedAllThingsUnsetMentioned obj;
	for (obj=IK2_First: obj: obj=obj.IK2_Link) {
		give obj ~mentioned;
	}
];
[ OptimizedAllThingsUnsetWorkflag obj;
	for (obj=IK2_First: obj: obj=obj.IK2_Link) {
		give obj ~workflag;
	}
];
-).

[We never want to search (or sort) through the entire Table of Locale Priorities, so we manually keep track of the number of "live" rows. We'll also avoid use of the I7 notion of blank rows. Unused rows will be marked by "nothing" in the object column.]
The locale-table-count is a number that varies.

[This replacement phrase is heavily optimized. It behaves the same as the standard version, except that deleted rows get "nothing" in the object column instead of being marked blank.]
To set the/-- locale priority of (O - an object) to (N - a number):
	if O is a thing:
		if N <= 0:
			now O is mentioned;
		[search the active part of the table for O; also note the first null row]
		let rownum be 0;
		let blanknum be 0;
		repeat with I running from 1 to locale-table-count:
			let ent be the notable-object in row I of  the Table of Locale Priorities;
			if ent is nothing:
				if blanknum is 0:
					now blanknum is I;
				next;
			if ent is O:
				now rownum is I;
				break;
		if rownum > 0: [found it]
			if N > 0:
				[change the existing row]
				choose row rownum in the Table of Locale Priorities;
				now the locale description priority entry is N;
			else:
				[delete the existing row, by putting in "nothing".]
				choose row rownum in the Table of Locale Priorities;
				now the notable-object entry is nothing;
				now the locale description priority entry is 999;
		otherwise: [didn't find it]
			if N > 0:
				if blanknum is 0:
					[add a new row]
					increment locale-table-count;
					choose row locale-table-count in the Table of Locale Priorities;
					now the notable-object entry is O;
					now the locale description priority entry is N;
				else:
					[use the found null row]
					choose row blanknum in the Table of Locale Priorities;
					now the notable-object entry is O;
					now the locale description priority entry is N.

The optimized initialise locale description rule is listed instead of the initialise locale description rule in the before printing the locale description rulebook.
This is the optimized initialise locale description rule:
	now the locale paragraph count is 0;
	rapidly set all things not mentioned; [loops through all things]
	[Mark the table as empty (without blanking every single row)]
	now the locale-table-count is zero.

The optimized interesting locale paragraphs rule is listed instead of the interesting locale paragraphs rule in the for printing the locale description rulebook.
This is the optimized interesting locale paragraphs rule:
	let the domain be the parameter-object;
	sort the Table of Locale Priorities up to row locale-table-count in locale description priority order;
	repeat with I running from 1 to locale-table-count:
		let O be the notable-object in row I of  the Table of Locale Priorities;
		if O is not nothing:
			carry out the printing a locale paragraph about activity with O;
	continue the activity.

The optimized you-can-also-see rule is listed instead of the you-can-also-see rule in the for printing the locale description rulebook.
This is the optimized you-can-also-see rule:
	let the domain be the parameter-object;
	let the mentionable count be 0;
	let the marked count be 0;
	rapidly set all things not marked for listing;  [loops through all things]
	repeat with I running from 1 to locale-table-count:
		let O be the notable-object in row I of the Table of Locale Priorities;
		if O is not nothing:
			let N be the locale description priority in row I of the Table of Locale Priorities;
			[say "[O] - [N].";]
			if N is greater than 0 and O is not mentioned:
				now O is marked for listing;
				increment the marked count;
			increase the mentionable count by 1;
	if the mentionable count is greater than 0:
		[note that mentioned things have not been marked for listing]
		begin the listing nondescript items activity with the domain;
		if the marked count is 0:
			abandon the listing nondescript items activity with the domain;
		otherwise:
			if handling the listing nondescript items activity:
				if the domain is a room:
					if the domain is the location, say "You ";
					otherwise say "In [the domain] you ";
				otherwise if the domain is a supporter:
					say "On [the domain] you ";
				otherwise if the domain is an animal:
					say "On [the domain] you ";
				otherwise:
					say "In [the domain] you ";
				say "can [if the locale paragraph count is greater than 0]also [end if]see ";
				let the common holder be nothing;
				let contents form of list be true;
				repeat with I running from 1 to locale-table-count:
					let list item be the notable-object in row I of the Table of Locale Priorities;
					if list item is nothing or list item is not marked for listing:
						next;
					if the holder of the list item is not the common holder:
						if the common holder is nothing,
							now the common holder is the holder of the list item;
						otherwise now contents form of list is false;

				filter list recursion to unmentioned things;
				if contents form of list is true and the common holder is not nothing,
					list the contents of the common holder, as a sentence, including contents,
						giving brief inventory information, tersely, not listing
						concealed items, listing marked items only;
				otherwise say "[a list of marked for listing things including contents]"; [loops through all things]
				if the domain is the location, say " here";
				say ".[paragraph break]";
				unfilter list recursion;
			end the listing nondescript items activity with the domain;
	continue the activity.

When play begins (this is the initially list contents rule):
	if the static object grouping option is active:
		follow the initially listing contents rules.

To initially group (OS - description of objects) together: (- InitiallyGroupTogether({OS}, {-list-together}); -).
To initially group (OS - description of objects) together giving articles: (- InitiallyGroupTogether({OS}, {-articled-list-together}); -).
To initially group (OS - description of objects) together as (T - text): (- InitiallyGroupTogether({OS}, {T}); -).

Large Game Speedup ends here.

---- DOCUMENTATION ----

Inform's Standard Rules take some shortcuts which are acceptable for most games, but which become inefficient in very large games. In particular, the "look" action can take several times longer than necessary.

If your game has less than a hundred things, you don't need this extension. The problems we're talking about arise when the game has four or five hundred things defined.

(Of course, if you have hundreds of things *in one room*, that will always be slow! And this extension does not address the problem of having big slow "every turn" rules. This is purely about the "look" action, and some related phrases that print lists.)

(This extension was written for Inform 6G60. It has not been tested with earlier or later releases)

The problem, in brief, is code such as

	now all things are not mentioned;

or

	repeat through all things:

(Or the Inform 6 equivalents.) The Standard Rules have such code in a few places. This extension removes some (though not all) of these.

- We improve the code that handles the Table of Locale Priorities. (Which is defined as having a blank row for each thing in the game.) It no longer has to repeat through or sort the entire table; it just deals with as many rows as needed to manage the current room.

- We improve the I6 list writer. Again, this removes most of the places where the code was iterating through all objects.

- We define more efficient "to say the list of..." phrases. One often writes phrases like

	say the list of things in the fridge;
	say a list of people on the sofa;

Despite their appearance, these wind up iterating through the entire universe, not just the container or supporter in question. This extension defines fast alternatives:

	say the list of things *in the fridge;
	say a list of people *in the sofa;

The star indicates that the "*in" phrase is mandatory, and understood as a parent object to iterate through. (Note that it is "*in", not "*on", even for supporters.)

- We define an efficient "empty" adjective for containers and supporters. The Standard Rules do not define this, and it's tempting to use idioms such as "if nothing is in the box" or "if the number of things in the box is zero". These are slow. The "if the box is empty" term defined here is fast.

(If you have defined an "empty" term for your containers or supporters, this extension will conflict with it. Sorry.)

- Finally, we define an alternate way to group objects in lists. The Standard Rules recompute object grouping every time a list is printed. But in most games, object groups are fixed -- perhaps the Tarot cards are one group, the Scrabble tiles are another group, and so on. So it's possible to compute this once, when the game begins, and then leave it alone.

Because this alternate plan is less flexible, it doesn't happen automatically. You have to invoke it by defining an option:

	Use static object grouping.

You must then modify all your "Before listing contents..." grouping rules. If you have a rule such as

	Before listing contents:
		group Tarot cards together.

...change it to:

	Rule for initially listing contents:
		initially group Tarot cards together.

Do *not* use the standard "group X together" phrases when static option grouping is on; always use the "initially group X together" form. (The "...giving articles" and "...as (text)" variants are available.) And don't do either in a "before listing contents" rule. Move all of this logic to a "rule for initially listing contents".

Example: ** Four Hundred Things - A small game with a lot of stuff.

This game contains 400 offstage objects. (We build these 50 at a time, because the compiler refuses to create hundreds at once.) It demonstrates the "static object grouping" option, and the fast idiom for listing contents.

How much does this improve performance? I tested the example below with and without Large Game Speedup. (When removing the extension, I added a definition "a supporter is empty if nothing is on it." I also changed the "*in" and "initially listing" rules back to their standard forms.)

For each command, I list the number of Glulx VM opcodes and the time taken by the command in two interpreters (Glulxe in C, Quixe in JS). Tests on a 2.7GHz iMac.

	LOOK in Kitchen:
	without: 1013460 cycles (103.647 ms C, 1918 ms JS)
	with: 77386 cycles (20.791 ms C, 193 ms JS)

	JUMP
	without: 54474 cycles (18.451 ms C, 117 ms JS)
	with: 43752 cycles (16.606 ms C, 103 ms JS)

	EXAMINE MIRROR in Kitchen
	without: 75159 cycles (20.602 ms C, 178 ms JS)
	with: 45975 cycles (17.757 ms C, 104 ms JS)

	LOOK in Game Room
	without: 1025383 cycles (105.147 ms C, 1844 ms JS)
	with: 105354 cycles (22.663 ms C, 193 ms JS)

As you see, a lag of nearly two seconds (in the Javascript interpreter) is cut to a fraction of a second.


	*: "Four Hundred Things"

	Include Large Game Speedup by Andrew Plotkin.

	Use static object grouping.

	The player carries the bar of soap.

	The Kitchen is a room. "You're in the Kitchen. The Bathroom is east, and the Game Room is south."

	The table is a fixed in place supporter in the Kitchen.
	The description is "The table only shows up in the room description if something is on it."

	The backpack is a container in the Kitchen.
	Understand "back", "pack" as backpack.
	The book is in the backpack.

	Rule for writing a paragraph about the table:
		now the table is mentioned;
		if the table is not empty:
			say "A table stands here. On it [is-are a list of things *in the table]."

	The apple is in the Kitchen.
	The wedge of cheese is on the table.

	The mirror is in the Kitchen. "A portable mirror stands to one side."

	Check examining the mirror:
		instead say "In the mirror you see [a list of things *in the location]."
	Check searching the mirror:
		instead try examining the mirror.

	The Bathroom is east of the Kitchen. "This is the Bathroom. If you drop the soap here, you won't be able to see it. (Except in the mirror.)"

	The counter is a scenery supporter in the Bathroom.
	The description is "This is an ordinary scenery supporter."

	After choosing notable locale objects for the Bathroom:
		set the locale priority of the soap to 0.

	The Game Room is south of the Kitchen. "Games are piled around you."

	A piece is a kind of thing. The king, the pawn, the rook, and the bishop are pieces.
	All pieces are in the Game Room.
	A card is a kind of thing. The jack, the trey, and the ace are cards.
	All cards are in the Game Room.

	Rule for initially listing contents:
		initially group pieces together as "chess pieces";
		initially group cards together.

	Before grouping together cards: 
		say "[listing group size in words] playing cards (". 
	After grouping together cards: 
		say ")".

	Instead of jumping:
		say "You jump up and see all the rooms: [the list of rooms]."

	A clone is a kind of thing.
	There are 50 clones.
	There are 50 clones.
	There are 50 clones.
	There are 50 clones.
	There are 50 clones.
	There are 50 clones.
	There are 50 clones.
	There are 50 clones.

	Test me with "jump / get cheese, mirror / look / get apple / east / drop soap / put apple on counter / look / look in mirror / w / s / drop all / look".
