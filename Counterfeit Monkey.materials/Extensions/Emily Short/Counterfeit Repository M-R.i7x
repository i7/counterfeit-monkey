Understand "artificial grass" or "model" or "grass" as the motte.

Report putting the army on the motte:
	say "[We] arrange the army around the motte in position to storm up the sides of the hill.

It looks wrong, of course, because the motte belongs to medieval castle construction and the army is decorated for the late 19th, but this wouldn't trouble a small child, and we mustn't be deterred by it either." instead.

The mottes are a supporter. The heft of the mottes is 4. The description of the mottes is "A model of several artificial hills used for fortification.

It fits in perfectly with the rest of Lena's selection. Really amazing work. I've seen other people who were able to do impressive things with local field distortions [--] think hard enough and you can prejudice the outcome of a linguistic transition.

Thanks to these twin magical abilities (apparently), the Phoenicians were able to reach the shores of Atlantis."
"knights" or "templar" or "knights templar"	"I'm not quite sure, because the language is deliberately obscure, but I think it's meant as an indictment of religious avocation. But I'm not sure.

"space" or "aliens/alien" or "space alien/aliens" or "extraterrestrials" or "UFO/UFOs"	"I'm not sure the poet of this one was taking the task entirely seriously, because he suggests that UFOs landed in Atlantis and imbued the population with pseudo-telepathic abilities through a form of genetically modified chard."

[One of the things I set out to do with the puzzle system in my previous game Savoir-Faire was to duplicate all the dull standard puzzles I was sick of seeing, but with some new twist on them that hadn't been done before. The one that there was really no way to include, however, was the password puzzle: too many IF games use password puzzles as a form of riddle (where you have to guess on the basis of some hints) or a cheap search puzzle (where the answer is written down on a note near the computer). Never in IF does anyone follow good security protocols with strong passwords that aren't written down.

So, I thought, what about a puzzle where people do use fairly unguessable passwords, but the whole concept of a 'password' is compromised by some other law of the universe?]

The password-thing is an r-abstract thing. The description is "A glowing series of numbers and figures in the air, which changes and flickers now and then. Probably responding to its surroundings. It seems unstable just now." The printed name is "password". Understand "password" as the password-thing.

Report switching on a computer which is running a password-lock program when the password-thing is marked-visible:

	let target screen be a random screen that is part of the noun;
	try examining the target screen;
	say "[The password-thing] flickers meaningfully, then stabil[ize]s." instead.

Instead of examining the password-thing when a password-lock program (called target program) is marked-visible:
	say "Under the influence of [the random computer which is running the target program], the password has settled down and now reads '[password of the target program]'."

Rule for supplying a missing noun while password-entering (this is the guess the password while password-entering rule):
	now the noun is the password-thing.

Rule for supplying a missing second noun while password-entering something on (this is the guess a keyboard while password-entering rule):
	if the player can touch a keyboard (called target):
		now the second noun is the target;
	otherwise:
		say "You'll have to specify what you want to type on." instead.

Setting action variables for password-entering something on something which is not a keyboard:
	if the second noun is a computer:
		let the relevant keyboard be a random keyboard which is part of the second noun;
		now the second noun is the relevant keyboard;
	otherwise if the second noun is something which is part of a computer (called the relevant computer):
		let the relevant keyboard be a random keyboard which is part of the relevant computer;

The description of the plat is "A single map showing the land divisions of this immediate vicinity. The Bureau land abuts the park, of course, and a fair amount of land owned for offices by DCL. No private land is directly next to the Bureau land, presumably to make it more difficult for anyone to dig through or plant listening devices."

The description of the plats is "A roll of zoning commission plans, laying out the subdivision of some land at the outskirts of town. The Bureau is chary about allowing new housing developments because it worries about the limited land available on the island; so it is unsurprising that the housing areas allowed are designed for dense occupancy in the form of apartments."
The description of the plain-plate is "A commemorative plate celebrating the island's independence from England. It shows the Depluralized Marine [--] the single soldier captured after the island's deplural[izing] guns had a chance to work [--] chained unhappily to a wall."

	The greeting of Poe is "'Fascinating to meet you,' says Poe."

Report involuntarily-dropping Poe:
	say "[The noun] scrambles out of our embrace as rapidly as possible, looking extremely Victorian." instead.

Rule for writing a topic sentence about Poe when the location contains at least one mentionable person:
	say "[Poe] is looking [a random mentionable person] over and muttering to himself as though trying to find rhymes. "

The poi is an edible thing. The description is "It's a gloopy, purplish paste made of taro root according to Hawaiian traditions.

Curiously, therefore, the concept manifests itself as a little floaty cloud in which a flustered gent with Victorian [if the player wears the Britishizing goggles]moustaches[otherwise]mustaches[end if], verging on apoplexy."

Instead of listening to the poppycock, say "[one of]'POPPYCOCK!' shouts the little imaginary man[or]'ARRANT NONSENSE,' shouts the angry poppycock-gentleman[or]'STUFF! POPPYCOCK!' The imaginary man is beet red and his mustaches quiver[at random]."

The pose is an r-abstract thing. The heft of the pose is 0. The description of the pose is "At the moment it looks like a tiny man [one of]emulating The Thinker[or]staring importantly into the middle distance while tiny cameras flash[or]waving and smiling, in best Atlantean politico fashion, with a sprig of olive leaves pinned to his vest and a blue 'just voted' smudge on his thumb[or]semaphoring the letter A[or]demonstrating first position in ballet[as decreasingly likely outcomes]."

Section 12 - Power Cord

[This section incorporates the power cord but also the rest of the socketry, etc. It would also have been reasonable to define this stuff in the Generator Room section, but it felt easier to keep all the relevant parts together in one place.

Plugging things into other things is one of those maddening verbs that needs a lot of implementation just to cover the standard idiomatic ways of talking about it. We want the player to feel there's enough depth here that they can unplug bits individually, but "PLUG IN DAIS" should also just work, given the presence of the power cord.

Another complication comes from the destructibility of objects; if the player gels or anagrams the power cord while it's plugged in, it should automatically unplug, or some weird results may appear when it's reconstructed.]

Test cord with "test chord / get cord / test plugging".

Test plugging with "look / x socket / x wall socket / x dais / x dais socket / get wall socket / get dais socket / plug cord into wall socket / plug plug into dais socket / unplug dais / unplug wall socket / plug wall socket into dais / unplug cord / plug cord into dais / take plug / unplug cord / plug in dais / test gun-ownership / shoot cord with gun / look / shoot crow with gun / x cord / unplug cord / plug in dais" in the Workshop.


Test gun-ownership with "load gun" holding the anagramming gun and the bullets.

A ranking rule when the power cord is mentionable:
	increase the description-rank of the power cord by 10;
	increase the description-rank of the programmable dais by 12.

Definition: a power cord is deeply dull if 1 is 2.


A dangerous destruction rule for the power cord:
	while a massive plug (called target plug) is plugged into something (called the other):
		now the target plug is not plugged into the other.


Rule for writing a topic sentence about the power cord:
	say "[A power cord] snakes across the ground";
	if a massive plug is plugged into the dais socket and a massive plug is plugged into the wall socket:
		say ", connecting [the dais socket] to [the wall socket]. ";
	otherwise if a massive plug is plugged into the dais socket:
		say ", plugged into [the dais socket] and with the other end dangling free. ";
	otherwise if a massive plug is plugged into the wall socket:
		say ", one end plugged into [the wall socket] but the other unattached. ";
	otherwise:
		say ". Neither end is currently plugged into anything. ";
	say run paragraph on.

The description of the power cord is "This is the heaviest-duty cabling I've ever seen in my life: thick as a snake, covered in yellow sheathing, with a [random massive plug] at each end."
	The massive plug is a kind of thing. The description of a massive plug is "There are [unless the player wears the Britishizing goggles]two flat parallel prongs and one round grounding prong[otherwise]two flat horizontal prongs and one flat vertical prong[end if]. The prongs look extraordinarily sturdy and determined." Understand "prong" or "prongs" as a massive plug.
	Two massive plugs are part of the power cord.

A power socket is a kind of thing. The description of a power socket is usually "[if something is plugged into the item described]A power socket, with one end of the power cord currently plugged in[otherwise]A power socket suitable for plugging a cord into[end if]."

A power socket called a wall socket is fixed in place in the Workshop.
The initial appearance is "A specialized wall socket is built into the east wall, clearly not part of the ordinary power system for the Bureau."

A power socket called a dais socket is part of the programmable dais.

After printing the name of the dais socket while examining:
	say "[if something is plugged into the dais socket and there is a free massive plug] (with power cord attached, though the cord connects to nothing)[otherwise if something is plugged into the dais socket] (from which a power cord runs to the wall)[otherwise] (with no cord currently plugged in)[end if]"

Attachment relates one massive plug to one power socket. The verb to be plugged into implies the attachment relation.

Sanity-check an actor inserting the power cord into a power socket:
	if a free massive plug (called target plug) is part of the power cord:
		try the actor plugging the target plug into the second noun instead.

Sanity-check inserting a massive plug into a power socket:
	try the actor plugging the noun into the second noun instead.

Sanity-check taking a massive plug:
	if the noun is plugged into something (called the target):
		try unplugging the noun from the target instead;
	otherwise:
		try taking the power cord instead.

Understand "unplug [a massive plug] from [a power socket]" as unplugging it from. Understand "unplug [something] from [something]" as unplugging it from. Unplugging it from is an action applying to two things. Understand "unplug [something]" as unplugging it from.

Rule for supplying a missing second noun when unplugging something from:
	if the noun is a massive plug:
		if the noun is plugged into something (called target socket):
			now the second noun is the target socket;
		otherwise:
			say "[The noun] is not plugged in anyhow." instead;
	otherwise if the noun is a power socket:
		if something (called target plug) is plugged into the noun:
			now the second noun is the noun;
			now the noun is the target plug;
		otherwise:
			say "Nothing is plugged into [the noun] anyway." instead;
	otherwise if the noun incorporates a power socket (called target socket):
		if something (called target plug) is plugged into the target socket:
			now the second noun is the target socket;
			now the noun is the target plug;
		otherwise:
			say "Nothing is plugged into [the noun] anyway." instead;

Sanity-check unplugging something which incorporates a power socket from something which incorporates a power socket:
	try freeing the power cord instead.

Sanity-check unplugging something which is not a massive plug from something:
	say "[The noun] [are] not a plug to start with." instead.

Sanity-check unplugging something from something which is not a power socket:
	say "[The second noun] [are] not a socket." instead.

Sanity-check unplugging a free massive plug from something:
	say "[The noun] [are] not plugged in anyway." instead.

Carry out unplugging something from something:
	now the noun is not plugged into the second noun.

Report unplugging something from something:
	say "[We] unplug [the noun] from [the second noun][if two free massive plugs are part of the power cord]. Both ends of the power cord are now free[otherwise]. The other plug is still attached to [the random power socket which is not the second noun][end if]."

Understand "unplug [the power cord]" as freeing. Freeing is an action applying to one thing.

Sanity-check freeing the power cord:
	if the number of free massive plugs is 2:
		say "The power cord is already detached." instead.

Carry out freeing:
	repeat with item running through massive plugs which are plugged into a power socket:
		if the item is plugged into a power socket (called target socket):
			try unplugging the item from the target socket.

Understand "plug [a free massive plug] into [a power socket]" as plugging it into. Understand "plug [a massive plug] into [a power socket]" as plugging it into.  Understand "plug [something] into [something]" as plugging it into.

Understand "plug in [a free massive plug] to [a power socket]" as plugging it into. Understand "plug in [a massive plug] to [a power socket]" as plugging it into.  Understand "plug in [something] to [something]" as plugging it into.


Plugging it into is an action applying to two things.

Definition: a massive plug is free if it is not plugged into a power socket.

Sanity-check plugging something which is not a massive plug into a power socket:
	if the noun is the power cord:
		if a massive plug (called target plug) is free:
			try plugging the target plug into the second noun instead;
		otherwise:
			say "The power cord is already fully plugged in." instead;
	say "That's not what the best electrical safety engineers recommend." instead.

Sanity-check plugging a massive plug into something which is not a power socket:
	say "Better look for a socket instead." instead.

Sanity-check plugging the power cord into something:
	if the second noun is a power socket:
		if a massive plug (called target plug) is free:
			try plugging the target plug into the second noun instead;
		otherwise:
			say "The plugs are fully plugged in already." instead;
	otherwise if the second noun incorporates a power socket (called target socket):
		if a massive plug (called target plug) is free:
			try plugging the target plug into the target socket instead;
		otherwise:
			say "The plugs are fully plugged in already." instead;

Carry out plugging a massive plug into a power socket:
	if the power cord is not in the location:
		silently try dropping the power cord;
	now the noun is plugged into the second noun.

Report plugging a massive plug into a power socket:
	say "[We] plug the power cord firmly into [the second noun][if a free massive plug is part of the power cord]. The other end remains free and not plugged into anything[otherwise]. Both ends of the power cord are now plugged in, so the dais is connected to the wall socket[end if]." instead.

Sanity-check going somewhere when the player carries the power cord:
	if the number of free massive plugs is less than 2:
		try dropping the power cord;
		if the player carries the power cord:
			stop the action.

Understand "plug [a power socket] into [a power socket]" as connecting it to.  Understand "plug in [a power socket] in [a power socket]" as connecting it to. Connecting it to is an action applying to two things.

Sanity-check an actor connecting something to something:
	carry out the caching scope activity with the actor;
	if the actor does not carry the power cord:
		if the the power cord is marked-visible:
			try the actor taking the power cord;
		if the actor does not carry the power cord:
			if the actor is the player:
				say "Some kind of power cord would be needed to bridge the gap.";
			stop the action.

Carry out an actor connecting something to something:
	unless something is plugged into the noun:
		let the target plug be a random free massive plug;
		try plugging the target plug into the noun;
	if a massive plug (called next target plug) is free:
		try plugging the next target plug into the second noun;

Understand "plug in [something]" as connecting.
	Connecting is an action applying to one thing.

Sanity-check connecting something:
	if the noun is a power socket:
		make no decision;
	if the noun is a massive plug:
		make no decision;
	if the noun incorporates a power socket:
		make no decision;
	if the noun incorporates a massive plug:
		make no decision;
	if the noun is a device:
		say "[The noun] [appear] to be adequately powered already." instead;
	say "[The noun] feature[s] no dangling power cords or sockets." instead.

Carry out an actor connecting something:
	try the actor connecting the dais socket to the wall socket.

[There's really no particular point to having the britishizing goggles change the compatibility of the plug. I just couldn't resist.]

Sanity-check putting something which is not wearable on the rack:
	if the noun is the gel or the noun is the tub:

The description of the rite is "Flickering images depict [one of]candles and incense carried by those processing around the New Church on a holy day[or]a woman kneeling before a small rustic shrine and placing the figure of a metal god on it[or]a man drawing the letter A on his son's forehead with a grease pencil[or]a bonfire at the beach, over which a pig is being roasted. The pig's ears, hoofs, and entrails have been set to one side[at random]."

Test rite with "tutorial off / autoupgrade / wave p-remover at pear / put ear in t-inserter / get tear / gonear first aid station / put tear in bucket / get tier / load gun / shoot tier / x rite" [holding the pear and the tub and the anagramming gun and the anagram bullets in the Sensitive Equipment Room.]

[Originally the rock was described as "hefty and jagged, like the result of a volcanic event". Then I went to Kilauea on vacation and picked up some volcanic rocks, and they were the lightest rocks I've ever lifted. So that had to go. I decided that Brock's supportive personality, rather than his unpredictability, was the thing I wanted to express in the rock description.

geology.about.com lists basalt as a fairly dense rock, denser than limestone, marble, or granite; other weighty options included peridotite, gabbro, and diorite, but I figured those would be less familiar to the player.]

The description of the rock is "Heavy, dark, and roughly hexagonal, like a slice of basalt column.". The rock is essential.
	The scent-description is "mud".

Before putting the restoration gel on the rock when the rock is in a container (called the holder):
	say "(first removing the rock so Brock isn't squished by [the holder])[command clarification break]";
	try taking the rock;
	if the player does not carry the rock:
		stop the action.

"rock-bug"	{ rock, tub }	Sensitive Equipment Testing Room

Test rock-bug with "put rock in t-inserter / open tub / gel rock" [holding the rock and the tub in the Sensitive Equipment Testing Room.]

The roc is a rideable animal.
The initial appearance is "The roc towers over us, looking smarter than a bird has the right to look."
The description of the roc is "The bird is enormous[if the location is indoors], so big it seems incredible that it can even fit into the room[end if]. Brock is a tall man, but not nearly this tall. Its eyes are bright and (if [we] [are] not reading too much in) ironically clever; its plumage a little like an eagle's, if an eagle were made many times larger and feathered in a kind of sleek, luminous black."

[Every turn when the roc is in the Sunning Deck and the Sunning Deck is the location:
	say "[one of][The roc]'s claws dig into the cushions of the sunning deck as the yacht pitches[or][roc-igloo][or][The roc] stretches its wings out so that they reach the whole width of the yacht[or]I catch [the roc] looking at us[at random].".]

[To say roc-igloo:
	say "[one of][The roc] takes an interest in the white igloo-shaped thing that handles the yacht wifi[or]A tap of beak on plastic tells you [the roc] is checking out the wifi further[if Slango can see the roc][queue Slango-irritation as postponed optional][end if][or][The roc] turns its head experimentally and tries to fit the whole wifi antenna into its beak[stopping]".]

Instead of waving the letter-remover at the rock creating the roc when the location is indoors:
	say "[We][']d probably best wait until [we] [are] outside; I don't know what the consequence would be of generating a massive legendary bird of prey inside a small office building."

Instead of waving the letter-remover at the rock creating the roc when the location is the Open Sea:
	say "A bird that size would sink a little tiny boat like this one."

Rule for writing a paragraph about Slango when the roc is mentionable:
	say "[Slango] has come out, though he's standing well back from [the roc], which is surveying the scene speculatively.[paragraph break]"

Roc-flight is a scene. Roc-flight begins when the roc is in location. Roc-flight ends when the player is enclosed by the roc.

Sanity-check mounting the roc:
	if a heavy handled thing (called the encumbrance) which is not the roc is enclosed by location:
		say "[We][']ll want to bring [the encumbrance], but in [their] current state, [they] [are] much too heavy." instead.

Before mounting the roc:
	repeat with item running through things in the location:
		if the item is handled:
			try the player taking the item.
	[repeat with item running through visible handled things which are not enclosed by the player:
		try the player taking the item;
	repeat with item running through visible handled things which are not enclosed by the player:
		try the roc taking the item.]

Every turn during roc-flight:
	if the roc is in the location and a random chance of 1 in 2 succeeds:
		say "[one of]The roc looks sharply at [the random marked-visible thing][or]I am starting to find it unnerving how the roc looks at us[or]Are you sure that rocs don't eat people? It's giving us quite an intent stare[or]The roc paces up and down[or]The roc spreads its wings, then folds them again. It could really double as a pavilion if it would stay still in that position[or]The roc throws its head back and screams horribly for no obvious reason[or]The roc dips its beak in the water, then spits violently[at random]."

When roc-flight ends:
	say "It stares at us for a moment, and you climb carefully onto its back, putting our arms around its neck. A dozen drawbacks occur at the last minute. What if there isn't enough room for the takeoff? What if it needs to run [--] like a plane [--] before it can get airborne?";
	try the roc going down.

After roc going down from Precarious Perch:
	try the roc going north;
	follow the compass-drawing rule.

Report the roc going north from Precarious Perch:
	say "The roc strains its neck forward, spreads its wings and steps off the cliff. Its flaps are slow and [we] [are] losing altitude [--] so fast that at first I think [we][']ll fall into the ocean [--] but it takes only five or six flaps before the bird is able to glide straight out to sea." instead.

Report the roc going north from Abandoned Shore:
	say "The roc rather awkwardly climbs to the highest spot of rock it can easily reach. Then it strains its neck forward, spreads its wings and steps off the cliff. Its flaps are slow and [we] are losing altitude [--] so fast that at first I think [we][']ll fall into the ocean [--] but it takes only five or six flaps before the bird is able to glide straight out to sea." instead.

[The roc flies more or less the way condors fly, as documented by youtube. I'm not sure how far a bird of the roc's mass would need to descend before starting to glide, and almost certainly I haven't given it enough clearance, but text is at least more forgiving than an animation would be.]

Roc-soaring is a scene. Roc-soaring begins when roc-flight ends. Roc-soaring ends when the time since roc-soaring began is 2 minutes.

Sanity-check doing something other than examining or looking during roc-soaring:
	say "I don't know about you, but I don't dare do anything but hang on." instead.

Sanity-check going somewhere during roc-soaring:
	say "I think [we] pretty much have to go where the roc wants to go." instead.

Instead of looking during roc-soaring:
	say "The ocean is many feet below; a fall might not kill us, but it would certainly hurt. The sun has nearly set, and the sky is a soft blue, tempered by the evening haze.

If [we] crane as far as [we] safely can over our left shoulder, [we] can see the coastline near my house, and the old city walls, and the last trails of sunlight on the water."

When roc-soaring ends:
	say "I keep thinking [we] [are] going to lose our grip, but somehow [we] manage to stay on. Sooner than I expect, [we] make out the shine of Slango's yacht, and in the next moment [we] [are] above it. The roc circles once or twice before coming to land on the Sunning Deck.";
	now the initial appearance of Slango is "Slango is out, having seen us landing. He looks nervy.";
	move the roc to the Sunning Deck;
	set the current interlocutor to Slango;
	[queue altern-where-is-Brock as immediate obligatory;]
	move the player to the Sunning Deck;
	follow the compass-drawing rule instead.
