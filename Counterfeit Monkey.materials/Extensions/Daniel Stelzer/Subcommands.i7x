Subcommands by Daniel Stelzer begins here.

"Exposes the snippets referring to each noun."

An object has a snippet called the subcommand. The subcommand property translates into I6 as "parsed_snippet".

Include (-
Property parsed_snippet;
Constant EmptySnippet = 100;

Subcommands ends here.

---- DOCUMENTATION ----

This extension exposes the snippet which refers to each individual object, as its 'subcommand'.

	the subcommand of (object) -> snippet

If the player types "take the wand", referring to the black rod with a rusty star on the end, then the subcommand of the rod is "wand". This can be useful in disambiguation, or in adapting a description to use the player's phrasing.

Example: ** Subcommand Laboratory - A simple demonstration of how subcommands affect the parser.

Include Subcommands by Daniel Stelzer.

Before doing anything:
	if the noun is not nothing:
		say "Noun subcommand: [the subcommand of the noun].";
	if the second noun is not nothing:
		say "Second noun subcommand: [the subcommand of the second noun].";
	continue the action.

The Laboratory is a room. A red apple, a green apple, a red pear, and a green pear are in the Laboratory.
A shiny wooden box is a container in the Laboratory. It is closed and locked. The player carries a silver metal key.

Does the player mean taking the red apple when the subcommand of the red apple includes "red": it is very likely.
Does the player mean taking the green apple when the subcommand of the green apple includes "apple": it is very likely.

Test fruit with "get red / drop it / get apple / get pear".
Test box with "unlock the shiny wooden box with the silver key".
