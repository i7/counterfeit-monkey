Book 6 - Map Declarations

Chapter 1 - Main Map

[ The idea of having a map came in fairly early in the project, but it wasn't until late that I decided on the style.

I felt that this was the single most important piece of art to provision, since the player was going to have to spend the whole game staring at it, but even though I found some artists whose styles I really liked in general, I wasn't sure they suited Atlantis. I wanted something that instantly conveyed a sense of the major thoroughfares and significant monuments, but didn't take away from the pleasure of reading room descriptions for the first time. I wanted something less bland than a street map, less silly than a standard tourist map. It also needed to be clean enough not to distract the player with locations that weren't going to be accessible, and that was tricky because in practice this amount of urban space would contain many many more buildings than the player actually gets to go inside.

Ultimately I decided the typographical map would provide the right level of abstraction, fit Atlantis better than any of the other options, and also be something I might be able to put together myself. I started by having Inform build an EPS map of the game space, and then I started layering text layers over that. The majority of the fonts used are from the collection of HP Lovecraft Historical Society prop fonts ( http://www.cthulhulives.org/toybox/propdocs/propfonts.html ), a collection I bought a few years ago and have found almost endlessly useful: they come in many weights and densities and play together nicely.

There are a couple of exceptions. The font used for the half-hidden Greek font under New Church is Porson, a classic 19th century font for Greek lettering and one of my favorites for extended reading. The Bureau buildings are done inevitably in medium Helvetica, which is intentionally unaesthetic in context. Hoefler Ornaments provides the printer's ornament for the center of the roundabout.

For the player's you-are-here symbol, I used a nethack-like @ . I also experimented with a double dagger ‡ -- which to my eye was vaguely reminiscent of a stick figure but sort of doubled, as Alex and Andra are. But in the end I found that the round form of the @ was easier to position attractively in a range of locations; it especially looked better inside the O of the rotunda or inside the turret.

The @ sign indicating the player could in theory be placed as a transparent sprite over the appropriate part of the map. In practice, however, I needed to do a lot of brightness and outline adjustment to the @ sign depending on what was going beneath it. There were also particular small touches that would have been harder to add with a sprite, such as rotating the @ sign when the player was traveling on the winding path to the beach, or showing it underneath a layer of other text when the player was down in the crawlspace. I wanted the map to have a playful quality -- to feel individually considered, rather than mechanized.

Consequently, each place where the player's @ can appear gets its own copy of the image.

These are the definitions of images associated with room maps. They have to go after the rooms themselves are defined, and it was easier keeping them all in one place than scattering the declarations through the rest of code, so this section could be commented out for testing.]

Chapter 2 - Inside the Bureau

[

The design aims for the Bureau-internal maps are:

-- to create a sense of forward movement and discovery, both by opening new territory that the protagonists haven't seen before, and by rewarding the player's exploration with further map revelations
-- to establish a kind of chaos and alarm in the Wonderland portions of the map

]

Chapter 3 - Aboard the Yacht

[The yacht plans are different in almost every respect from the maps elsewhere. They use images exclusively rather than words, replace the player's @ sign with a yellow you-are-here star, and portray close-up details (such as beds and even toilets) that wouldn't even be hinted at in the main game area.

The design aims for the yacht plans are:

-- to convey the scope and concept of the yacht almost instantly, because the player will have relatively little time to explore
-- to make it clear that we're in a different sort of environment -- metaphysically different, even -- from Atlantis, and to suggest movement away from Atlantis (the bottom half of the screen is Bureau blue, the top half black)
-- to establish the claustrophobic self-containment of this little world
-- to keep rewarding the player with slightly surprising new visuals even at the end of the game
-- at the same time, to present an image whose colors and crisp design sensibilities do line up with those of the earlier maps]
