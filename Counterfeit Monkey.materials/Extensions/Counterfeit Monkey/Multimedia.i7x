Chapter 1 - Images

Section 1 - Compass Rose

[The aim of the graphics is to provide the player with visual orientation. We don't ever want the player to feel lost or to feel pressure to take notes. With a large game space, this is a challenge to achieve. Even though Bronze provided GO TO and FIND commands *and* came with a manual with a pre-drawn map, a number of players reported making maps of their own. This was a failure. Note-taking should be completely unnecessary unless the player happens to enjoy map-making for some reason.

The map concept borrows from commercial game minimaps that show goal locations as the player progresses.

Like the compass rose in Bronze, the compass rose here shows exits in different shades depending on whether the rooms in those directions have already been visited. The compass is also hyperlinked so that the player can click on it as an alternative to typing directions. ]

[The following is a hack. Originally the figure name associations were all properties of the direction objects, but some sort of memory bug happened when image properties were added to the nautical directions. The result was that the map itself was reconfigured weirdly -- for instance, Slango's Head was declared in source to be aft from Slango's Bunk, but in the game model it would be port of Slango's Bunk instead.]

To decide what figure-name is the dim image of (way - a direction):
	if way is:
		-- fore-port:
			decide on figure of dim fore-port;

			decide on figure of dim south;
		-- southeast:
			decide on figure of dim southeast;
		-- up:
			decide on figure of dim up;
		-- down:
			decide on figure of dim down.

To decide what figure-name is the unvisited image of (way - a direction):

A direction has a number called x-coordinate. A direction has a number called y-coordinate.

The compass width is a number that varies. The compass width is 120.

To establish compass graphlinks:
	let ZE be grid-margin;
	let D be grid-size;
	let DD be 2 * D;
	let DDD be compass width;
	let graphics window height be the height of the graphics window;
	let top-edge be graphics window height - (D * 4);
	let upper-mid be top-edge + D;
	let lower-mid be top-edge + DD;
	let bottom-edge be graphics window height - D;
	let super-top be graphics window height - (D * 5);
	let true-bottom be graphics window height;
	increase D by grid-margin;
	increase DD by grid-margin;
	increase DDD by grid-margin;
	if the location is nautical:
		set a graphlink identified as "goFP" from ZE by top-edge to D by upper-mid as "fore-port";
		set a graphlink identified as "goF" from D by top-edge to DD by upper-mid as "fore";
		set a graphlink identified as "goFSB" from DD by top-edge to DDD by upper-mid as "fore-starboard";
		set a graphlink identified as "goP" from ZE by upper-mid to D by lower-mid as "port";
		set a graphlink identified as "lookHere" from D by upper-mid to DD by lower-mid as "look";
		set a graphlink identified as "goSB" from DD by upper-mid to DDD by lower-mid as "starboard";
		set a graphlink identified as "goAP" from ZE by lower-mid to D by bottom-edge as "aft-port";
		set a graphlink identified as "goA" from D by lower-mid to DD by bottom-edge as "aft";
		set a graphlink identified as "goASB" from DD by lower-mid to DDD by bottom-edge as "aft-starboard";
		set a graphlink identified as "goD" from DD by bottom-edge to DDD by true-bottom as "down";
		set a graphlink identified as "goU" from ZE by bottom-edge to D by true-bottom as "up";
	otherwise:
		set a graphlink identified as "goNW" from ZE by top-edge to D by upper-mid as "northwest";
		set a graphlink identified as "goN" from D by top-edge to DD by upper-mid as "north";
		set a graphlink identified as "goNE" from DD by top-edge to DDD by upper-mid as "northeast";
		set a graphlink identified as "goW" from ZE by upper-mid to D by lower-mid as "west";
		set a graphlink identified as "lookHere" from D by upper-mid to DD by lower-mid as "look";
		set a graphlink identified as "goE" from DD by upper-mid to DDD by lower-mid as "east";
		set a graphlink identified as "goSW" from ZE by lower-mid to D by bottom-edge as "southwest";
		set a graphlink identified as "goS" from D by lower-mid to DD by bottom-edge as "south";
		set a graphlink identified as "goSE" from DD by lower-mid to DDD by bottom-edge as "southeast";
		set a graphlink identified as "goD" from DD by bottom-edge to DDD by true-bottom as "down";
		set a graphlink identified as "goU" from ZE by bottom-edge to D by true-bottom as "up";

To clear compass graphlinks:
	[first the nauticals]
	clear the graphlink identified as "goFP";
	clear the graphlink identified as "goF";
	clear the graphlink identified as "goFSB";
	clear the graphlink identified as "goP";
	clear the graphlink identified as "lookHere";
	clear the graphlink identified as "goSB";
	clear the graphlink identified as "goAP";
	clear the graphlink identified as "goA";
	clear the graphlink identified as "goASB";
	[and now the regular directions]
	clear the graphlink identified as "goNW";
	clear the graphlink identified as "goN";
	clear the graphlink identified as "goNE";
	clear the graphlink identified as "goW";
	clear the graphlink identified as "lookHere";
	clear the graphlink identified as "goE";
	clear the graphlink identified as "goSW";
	clear the graphlink identified as "goS";
	clear the graphlink identified as "goSE";
	clear the graphlink identified as "goD";
	clear the graphlink identified as "goU";

After going somewhere (this is the update compass on movement rule):
	redraw the map and compass;
	continue the action.

After someone going somewhere when the actor encloses the player:
	redraw the map and compass;
	continue the action.

[We want the compass to stay down in a corner of the screen and not to scale up too huge if the screen is resized. One of the irritating things about Glulx window management is that it's impossible to force an aspect ratio on the player, so I have no idea whether they're going to go tall-and-skinny or short-and-wide. Testers playing in full-screen mode sometimes found that the compass got way too large and encroached on the upper part of the map if I just set the compass to be one quarter the width of the window.]

To decide what number is grid-size:
	let width-quarter be (the width of the graphics window / 4);
	let height-quarter be (the height of the graphics window / 4);
	if width-quarter is greater than height-quarter:
		now compass width is height-quarter;
	else:
		now compass width is width-quarter;
	let D be compass width / 3;
	decide on D;

To decide what number is grid-margin:
	decide on grid-size / 2.

This is the compass-drawing rule:
	if glulx graphics is supported:
		clear compass graphlinks; [We need to reset the graphlinks every time the player resizes the window, because if the height of the screen changes, the compass may move vertically.]
		establish compass graphlinks;
		redraw the map and compass;

To determine compass coordinates:
	let ZE be 0;
	increase ZE by grid-margin;
	let D be grid-size;
	let DD be 2 * D;
	let DDD be compass width;
	let graphics window height be the height of the graphics window;
	let TE be graphics window height - (D * 4);
	let UM be TE + D;
	let LM be TE + DD;
	let BEE be graphics window height - D;
	increase D by grid-margin;
	increase DD by grid-margin;
	increase DDD by grid-margin;
	now x-coordinate of up is ZE;
	now y-coordinate of up is BEE;
	now x-coordinate of down is DD;
	now y-coordinate of down is BEE;
	now x-coordinate of fore-port is ZE;
	now y-coordinate of fore-port is TE;
	now x-coordinate of fore is D;
	now y-coordinate of fore is TE;
	now x-coordinate of fore-starboard is DD;
	now y-coordinate of fore-starboard is TE;
	now x-coordinate of port is ZE;
	now y-coordinate of port is UM;
	now x-coordinate of starboard is DD;
	now y-coordinate of starboard is UM;
	now x-coordinate of aft-port is ZE;
	now y-coordinate of aft-port is LM;
	now x-coordinate of aft is D;
	now y-coordinate of aft is LM;
	now x-coordinate of aft-starboard is DD;
	now y-coordinate of aft-starboard is LM;
	now x-coordinate of northwest is ZE;
	now y-coordinate of northwest is TE;
	now x-coordinate of north is D;
	now y-coordinate of north is TE;
	now x-coordinate of northeast is DD;
	now y-coordinate of northeast is TE;
	now x-coordinate of west is ZE;
	now y-coordinate of west is UM;
	now x-coordinate of east is DD;
	now y-coordinate of east is UM;
	now x-coordinate of southwest is ZE;
	now y-coordinate of southwest is LM;
	now x-coordinate of south is D;
	now y-coordinate of south is LM;
	now x-coordinate of southeast is DD;
	now y-coordinate of southeast is LM.

[Layer the image: a black background to fill in the top of the screen; blue for the bottom half so that if the map is too small, it will still look blue at the edges; then the map itself, proportionally scaled as large as it can reasonably be given the window dimensions; then the compass, built from the current circumstances.

In theory, it would have been possible to make the map images carry the compass directions as well. In practice, that presented several problems: more difficult to cope with minor map changes during final revisions, inability to indicate which directions have already been explored.]

Figure of background colour is the file "map-background-colour.png".

To redraw the map and compass:
	if glulx graphics is supported:
		clear the graphics window;
		[ Draw the background at slightly more than half the window height to ensure odd heights don't leave a 1 pixel black line ]
		let half height be (height of the graphics window / 2) + 1;
		draw figure of background colour in graphics window at x 0 and y half height scaled to width (width of the graphics window) and height half height;
		draw the local map of the location in graphics window;
		draw Figure of center-squiggle in graphics window at x x-coordinate of north and y y-coordinate of west scaled to width grid-size and height grid-size;
		determine compass coordinates;
		repeat with way running through directions:
			if the way is a listable exit:
				let X be the x-coordinate of way;
				let Y be the y-coordinate of way;
				if the room way from the location is visited:
					draw the visited image of the way in graphics window at x X and y Y scaled to width grid-size and height grid-size;
				otherwise:
					draw the unvisited image of the way in graphics window at x X and y Y scaled to width grid-size and height grid-size;



Chapter 2 - Sounds

[Once upon a time, when this was a much smaller and more comedic game, I was going to have sound effects communicating successes and failures with the various letter-manipulating instruments. But then the tone of the game changed and the game itself got a lot longer, and it felt like the cuteness of this would wear off long before hour eight or so of play.

Also, not all interpreters support Glulx sound, so I would have had to commit to a lot of extra testing work in order to get anything done in this line.

Ultimately it didn't seem worth it and the sounds were scrapped from the gameplay. I did have a fun afternoon once picking royalty-free sounds from a special effects database, though.]

[Sound of record scratch is the file "scratch14.aif".
Sound of sudden growth is the file "maximize04.aif".
Sound of scope success is the file "organic_nav_16.aif".
Sound of scope failure is the file "hi-tech_05.aif".
Sound of gel splort is the file "pop_15.aif". ]
