[The boar attack is based on several accounts of real life attacks in which the boar repeatedly rushed the victim (often unprovoked), gashing in several places. The most serious wounds generally are abdominal wounds inflicted after the boar has knocked the victim down. It would be more true to life if the boar also left gashes in the protagonist's leg in the process of knocking her down, but I decided to skip that because I didn't want to deal with a game state in which the protagonist was wounded but not dead: it would have needlessly complicated the writing of the end-game to no interesting narrative effect.]

A cad is a man. The description of the cad is "He is dressed with careless elegance, as I would expect from a rake and betrayer of ladies.

I, on the other hand, am trying to roll our eyes.[or]He acknowledges our glance, then quite deliberately looks away. Do you really go for this stuff?[or]He looks us up and down as though calculating what exactly [we] look like under this modern attire.[as decreasingly likely outcomes]". Understand "gentleman" or "man" or "fellow" as the cad.
	The scent-description of the cad is "old-fashioned cologne".

Rule for writing a topic sentence about the cad:
	if a woman is mentionable:

	otherwise:
		say "A gentleman in regency dress lounges against the far wall: evidently, this is the cad produced by [the letter-remover]. "

[In a much, much earlier version of the game, there were puzzles involving making the cad and then ordering him to do things (first bribing him with a kiss). As the game progressed and the tone shifted, this bit of silliness came to seem out of place; and, worse, it became obvious that having dozens and dozens of possibly persuadable, action-taking NPCs would significantly complicate implementation. So all the persuasion rules were axed and there are no puzzles involving getting generated NPCs to do things, aside from the mechanic in the garage.]

[A persuasion rule for asking the cad to try doing something:
	if the cad is amenable:
		now the cad is disinclined;
		say "'This one fav[our],' the cad allows. [run paragraph on]";
		persuasion succeeds;
	otherwise:
		say "[one of]'I will try [--] and only try [--] anything you ask me,' he says, 'but only at the cost of a kiss.'[or]'You know the forfeit by now,' he says.[or]'I accept payments only in advance.'[or]He smiles meaningfully.[stopping]";
		persuasion fails. ]

Instead of kissing the cad:
	say "[one of]Summoning your courage and all my patience, [we] stand on tip-toes and kiss the gentleman. He returns the fav[our], with all the skill that his nature requires.

You, I can tell, are enjoying this. I on the other hand am going to have to gouge it out of my brain with a power drill later.[or]You repeat your earlier performance, while I do my level best to stop you.[stopping]".


Every turn when the player carries the cad:
	move the cad to the location;
	say "[The cad] turns out to be a tall and somewhat muscular gentleman, and [we] are unable to support him during the transformation; by the time it is done, he is more standing in our embrace than actually being carried by us. I take a hasty, embarrassed step back.

He smiles knowingly, but merely straightens his cuffs."

[Unsuccessful attempt by the cad trying doing something:
	say "[one of]But [--] wouldn't you have expected it? [--] the cad is unable to fulfill his promise.[or][paragraph break]'I regret,' he says, with a bow, 'that I am unable to oblige.'[paragraph break]After trying for a moment, he says, 'Alas, I believe you have asked too great a fav[our].'[or][paragraph break]'This is harder than I expected,' he remarks after a moment. 'And insufficiently entertaining.'[or][paragraph break]'This is worse than the incident with Sally Jersey and her chambermaid,' he mutters under his breath, giving up.[as decreasingly likely outcomes]". ]

Instead of putting the restoration gel on the cad:
	say "As you approach, he takes a step backward and fends you off with one (finely-boned yet manly) hand. [one of]'I think not,' he says, in a low voice that thrills you deeply. 'I never would allow a lady to apply an unknown liniment to my person.'[or]Apparently he hasn't changed his stance on unidentified substances.[stopping]".

[card]


[The aim here is to hint at an Atlantean tarot, focusing especially on cards that have something to do with the relationship of the state and the individual, or duality within the individual. Strength is traditionally shown as a young lady managing a tame lion, but there are no lions on Atlantis; whereas the squid is associated with Atlantean inventiveness and power but suggests tentacle porn as well; the squid is a subversive force. The figure of the Magician represents an All-Purpose Officer with his weird array of very special[ize]d tools; Justice is Atlantida herself, somewhat ironically.]

Card-style is a kind of value. Some card-styles are defined by the Table of Card-Styles.

Strength	""	"A young nude lady lounges in the embrace of a giant squid. They are apparently on very good terms"
Tower	"the "	"It represents the Tower of Babel being struck by lightning. The top of the tower is falling over, and terrified builders run in every direction. In Atlantean terms it is the end of the world"

Twins	"the "	"They're male and female. A floating, sky-born figure above them is either choosing one or about to shoot one: it's hard to know what to make of the pointer or arrow it wields"
Temperance	""	"An official-looking man is operating a gigantic synthes[ize]r. Out of its bottom fall a flood of oxymoronic figures: a dwarf elephant, a giant mouse, a bittersweet cake."

The description of the card is "Not a playing card, as I might have expected, or a calling card, or even an index card, but a Tarot card, representing [article of (card-style of the card)][card-style of the card].

	else:
		if the Roundabout is not visited:

[My beta-tester Sam Kabo Ashwell is responsible for the inclusion of this nauseating substance, for which he helpfully provided the following recipe:

'Take 10 gallons of ale and a large cock, the older the better; parboil the cock, flay him, and stamp him in a stone mortar until his bones are broken (you must gut him when you flay him). Then, put the cock into two quarts of sack, and put to it five pounds of raisins of the sun-stoned; some blades of mace, and a few cloves.

topic	num	description
"1942"	1942	"Here is her militant 1940s rendition, where she stands bestride Atlantis; Axis planes are flying past her at head level. At any moment she might bite one and shake it, like a bulldog"
"1951"	1951	"Atlantida sits on a throne, wearing a blue dress and an incongruous string of housewifely pearls. In her right hand is the letter A with atom-like rings around it [--] as though to claim that letters are the true atoms of the universe"
"1958"	1958	"A sassy, security-conscious spirit of Atlantis, wearing a secretarial suit and putting a finger to her lips: the wink apparently means that it's alluring not to tell things to spies"
"1964"	1964	"This dossier contains a political cartoon: under comic OOPS lettering, Atlantida is seen shoveling dirt back over an assortment of ancient-looking lamps, pottery, and broken columns. Probably a reference to that incident where a portion of a Roman villa came to light and caused a temporary disruption in the strength of local conversions"
"1968"	1968	"The 1968 edition was some sort of hippy goddess of plenty (flowing hair, flowing skirts, cornucopia of local fruits)"

"1975"	1975	"There isn't any official propaganda for this year, only a contemporary magazine cover showing Atlantida arm in arm with Uncle Sam. Hard to tell for sure whether that was praise or criticism"
"1982"	1982	"A business-like, formidable Atlantida in the early 80s, looking Strong On Def[ense] and Tough On Misspelling, with an olive branch in one hand and an anagramming gun in the other"
"1983"	1983	"This year's folder doesn't contain any official propaganda posters; instead it's bulging with copies of a protest leaflet that shows a bare-breasted Atlantida leading rebels against the Bureau of Orthography, carrying placards in fav[our] of more referenda and true individual liberty"
"1989"	1989	"Newspaper clippings only. In one cartoon, Atlantida is imprisoned, looking out of the bars of her cell at Czechoslovakian and Romanian revolutionaries in envy at their newfound freedom. Another is just a written column commenting on the bicentennial of the French Revolution and suggesting that the figure of Atlantida is now associated with the spirit of revolutionary change"
"1991"	1991	"Photographs of rioters in Deep Street show people carrying posters of a bare-breasted Atlantida"
"1994"	1994	"Print-offs from an the early days of the world wide web show Atlantida's Home Page, plainly an organ[izing] platform for those interested in overthrowing the Bureau and promoting the more frequent and rigorous use of referendum voting. One imagines the site was shut down shortly thereafter"
"2003"	2003	"The dossier for 2003 is very thick. Memos back and forth indicate that officials are increasingly concerned with Atlantida and feel it is time (for some reason) to reclaim the figure as a 'government-positive' image. Consultations with an expensive New York advertising firm and a series of tv spots do not seem to have had the desired effect, however, because the project was canceled"

[One of the things I set out to do with the puzzle system in my previous game Savoir-Faire was to duplicate all the dull standard puzzles I was sick of seeing, but with some new twist on them that hadn't been done before. The one that there was really no way to include, however, was the password puzzle: too many IF games use password puzzles as a form of riddle (where you have to guess on the basis of some hints) or a cheap search puzzle (where the answer is written down on a note near the computer). Never in IF does anyone follow good security protocols with strong passwords that aren't written down.

So, I thought, what about a puzzle where people do use fairly unguessable passwords, but the whole concept of a 'password' is compromised by some other law of the universe?]

The password-thing is an r-abstract thing. The description is "A glowing series of numbers and figures in the air, which changes and flickers now and then. Probably responding to its surroundings.

	now the noun is the password-thing.

Rule for supplying a missing second noun while password-entering something on (this is the guess a keyboard while password-entering rule):
	if the player can touch a keyboard (called target):

	otherwise:
		say "You'll have to specify what you want to type on." instead.

Setting action variables for password-entering something on something which is not a keyboard:
	if the second noun is a computer:

	otherwise if the second noun is something which is part of a computer (called the relevant computer):
		let the relevant keyboard be a random keyboard which is part of the relevant computer;
		now the second noun is the relevant keyboard;

	carry out the rewarding successful answering activity with the chosen program;

To say randomly doing something:
	choose a random row in the Table of Past Actions;
	say the chosen action entry.

waiting
with 25 blank rows.

Every turn:
	if the number of blank rows in the Table of Past Actions is 0
	begin;
		choose a random row in the Table of Past Actions;
		blank out the whole row;
	end if;
	choose a blank row in the Table of Past Actions;
	now the chosen action entry is the current action.

Section 12 - Power Cord

[This section incorporates the power cord but also the rest of the socketry, etc. It would also have been reasonable to define this stuff in the Generator Room section, but it felt easier to keep all the relevant parts together in one place.

Plugging things into other things is one of those maddening verbs that needs a lot of implementation just to cover the standard idiomatic ways of talking about it. We want the player to feel there's enough depth here that they can unplug bits individually, but "PLUG IN DAIS" should also just work, given the presence of the power cord.

Another complication comes from the destructibility of objects; if the player gels or anagrams the power cord while it's plugged in, it should automatically unplug, or some weird results may appear when it's reconstructed.]

Test cord with "test chord / get cord / test plugging".

Test plugging with "look / x socket / x wall socket / x dais / x dais socket / get wall socket / get dais socket / plug cord into wall socket / plug plug into dais socket / unplug dais / unplug wall socket / plug wall socket into dais / unplug cord / plug cord into dais / take plug / unplug cord / plug in dais / test gun-ownership / shoot cord with gun / look / shoot crow with gun / x cord / unplug cord / plug in dais" in the Workshop.


Test gun-ownership with "load gun" holding the anagramming gun and the bullets.

A ranking rule when the power cord is mentionable:
	increase the description-rank of the power cord by 10;
	increase the description-rank of the programmable dais by 12.

Definition: a power cord is deeply dull if 1 is 2.


A dangerous destruction rule for the power cord:
	while a massive plug (called target plug) is plugged into something (called the other):
		now the target plug is not plugged into the other.


Rule for writing a topic sentence about the power cord:
	say "[A power cord] snakes across the ground";
	if a massive plug is plugged into the dais socket and a massive plug is plugged into the wall socket:
		say ", connecting [the dais socket] to [the wall socket]. ";
	otherwise if a massive plug is plugged into the dais socket:
		say ", plugged into [the dais socket] and with the other end dangling free. ";
	otherwise if a massive plug is plugged into the wall socket:
		say ", one end plugged into [the wall socket] but the other unattached. ";
	otherwise:
		say ". Neither end is currently plugged into anything. ";
	say run paragraph on.

The description of the power cord is "This is the heaviest-duty cabling I've ever seen in my life: thick as a snake, covered in yellow sheathing, with a [random massive plug] at each end."
	The massive plug is a kind of thing. The description of a massive plug is "There are [unless the player wears the Britishizing goggles]two flat parallel prongs and one round grounding prong[otherwise]two flat horizontal prongs and one flat vertical prong[end if]. The prongs look extraordinarily sturdy and determined." Understand "prong" or "prongs" as a massive plug.
	Two massive plugs are part of the power cord.

A power socket is a kind of thing. The description of a power socket is usually "[if something is plugged into the item described]A power socket, with one end of the power cord currently plugged in[otherwise]A power socket suitable for plugging a cord into[end if]."

A power socket called a wall socket is fixed in place in the Workshop.
The initial appearance is "A specialized wall socket is built into the east wall, clearly not part of the ordinary power system for the Bureau."

A power socket called a dais socket is part of the programmable dais.

After printing the name of the dais socket while examining:
	say "[if something is plugged into the dais socket and there is a free massive plug] (with power cord attached, though the cord connects to nothing)[otherwise if something is plugged into the dais socket] (from which a power cord runs to the wall)[otherwise] (with no cord currently plugged in)[end if]"

Attachment relates one massive plug to one power socket. The verb to be plugged into implies the attachment relation.

Sanity-check an actor inserting the power cord into a power socket:
	if a free massive plug (called target plug) is part of the power cord:
		try the actor plugging the target plug into the second noun instead.

Sanity-check inserting a massive plug into a power socket:
	try the actor plugging the noun into the second noun instead.

Sanity-check taking a massive plug:
	if the noun is plugged into something (called the target):
		try unplugging the noun from the target instead;
	otherwise:
		try taking the power cord instead.

Understand "unplug [a massive plug] from [a power socket]" as unplugging it from. Understand "unplug [something] from [something]" as unplugging it from. Unplugging it from is an action applying to two things. Understand "unplug [something]" as unplugging it from.

Rule for supplying a missing second noun when unplugging something from:
	if the noun is a massive plug:
		if the noun is plugged into something (called target socket):
			now the second noun is the target socket;
		otherwise:
			say "[The noun] is not plugged in anyhow." instead;
	otherwise if the noun is a power socket:
		if something (called target plug) is plugged into the noun:
			now the second noun is the noun;
			now the noun is the target plug;
		otherwise:
			say "Nothing is plugged into [the noun] anyway." instead;
	otherwise if the noun incorporates a power socket (called target socket):
		if something (called target plug) is plugged into the target socket:
			now the second noun is the target socket;
			now the noun is the target plug;
		otherwise:
			say "Nothing is plugged into [the noun] anyway." instead;

Sanity-check unplugging something which incorporates a power socket from something which incorporates a power socket:
	try freeing the power cord instead.

Sanity-check unplugging something which is not a massive plug from something:
	say "[The noun] [are] not a plug to start with." instead.

Sanity-check unplugging something from something which is not a power socket:
	say "[The second noun] [are] not a socket." instead.

Sanity-check unplugging a free massive plug from something:
	say "[The noun] [are] not plugged in anyway." instead.

Carry out unplugging something from something:
	now the noun is not plugged into the second noun.

Report unplugging something from something:
	say "[We] unplug [the noun] from [the second noun][if two free massive plugs are part of the power cord]. Both ends of the power cord are now free[otherwise]. The other plug is still attached to [the random power socket which is not the second noun][end if]."

Understand "unplug [the power cord]" as freeing. Freeing is an action applying to one thing.

Understand "detach [the power cord]" as freeing.

Sanity-check freeing the power cord:
	if the number of free massive plugs is 2:
		say "The power cord is already detached." instead.

Carry out freeing:
	repeat with item running through massive plugs which are plugged into a power socket:
		if the item is plugged into a power socket (called target socket):
			try unplugging the item from the target socket.

Understand "plug [a free massive plug] into [a power socket]" as plugging it into. Understand "plug [a massive plug] into [a power socket]" as plugging it into.  Understand "plug [something] into [something]" as plugging it into.

Understand "plug in [a free massive plug] to [a power socket]" as plugging it into. Understand "plug in [a massive plug] to [a power socket]" as plugging it into.  Understand "plug in [something] to [something]" as plugging it into.


Plugging it into is an action applying to two things.

Definition: a massive plug is free if it is not plugged into a power socket.

Sanity-check plugging something which is not a massive plug into a power socket:
	if the noun is the power cord:
		if a massive plug (called target plug) is free:
			try plugging the target plug into the second noun instead;
		otherwise:
			say "The power cord is already fully plugged in." instead;
	say "That's not what the best electrical safety engineers recommend." instead.

Sanity-check plugging a massive plug into something which is not a power socket:
	say "Better look for a socket instead." instead.

Sanity-check plugging the power cord into something:
	if the second noun is a power socket:
		if a massive plug (called target plug) is free:
			try plugging the target plug into the second noun instead;
		otherwise:
			say "The plugs are fully plugged in already." instead;
	otherwise if the second noun incorporates a power socket (called target socket):
		if a massive plug (called target plug) is free:
			try plugging the target plug into the target socket instead;
		otherwise:
			say "The plugs are fully plugged in already." instead;

Carry out plugging a massive plug into a power socket:
	if the power cord is not in the location:
		silently try dropping the power cord;
	now the noun is plugged into the second noun.

Report plugging a massive plug into a power socket:
	say "[We] plug the power cord firmly into [the second noun][if a free massive plug is part of the power cord]. The other end remains free and not plugged into anything[otherwise]. Both ends of the power cord are now plugged in, so the dais is connected to the wall socket[end if]." instead.

Sanity-check going somewhere when the player carries the power cord:
	if the number of free massive plugs is less than 2:
		try dropping the power cord;
		if the player carries the power cord:
			stop the action.

Understand "plug [a power socket] into [a power socket]" as connecting it to.  Understand "plug in [a power socket] in [a power socket]" as connecting it to. Connecting it to is an action applying to two things.

Understand "connect [a power socket] to [a power socket]" as connecting it to.

Sanity-check an actor connecting something to something:
	carry out the caching scope activity with the actor;
	if the actor does not carry the power cord:
		if the the power cord is marked-visible:
			try the actor taking the power cord;
		if the actor does not carry the power cord:
			if the actor is the player:
				say "Some kind of power cord would be needed to bridge the gap.";
			stop the action.

Carry out an actor connecting something to something:
	unless something is plugged into the noun:
		let the target plug be a random free massive plug;
		try plugging the target plug into the noun;
	if a massive plug (called next target plug) is free:
		try plugging the next target plug into the second noun;

Understand "plug in [something]" as connecting.
	Connecting is an action applying to one thing.

Sanity-check connecting something:
	if the noun is a power socket:
		make no decision;
	if the noun is a massive plug:
		make no decision;
	if the noun incorporates a power socket:
		make no decision;
	if the noun incorporates a massive plug:
		make no decision;
	if the noun is a device:
		say "[The noun] [appear] to be adequately powered already." instead;
	say "[The noun] feature[s] no dangling power cords or sockets." instead.

Carry out an actor connecting something:
	try the actor connecting the dais socket to the wall socket.

[There's really no particular point to having the britishizing goggles change the compatibility of the plug. I just couldn't resist.]

The description of the preamp is "It looks like just one specimen from the group from which you were working."

The PTA is an ambiguously plural person. The description of the PTA is "About a half-dozen soccer moms in sensible shoes, and a lone father, who looks bemused." The PTA is noisy. Understand "soccer moms" or "moms" or "shoes" or "lone" or "father" as the PTA.

Sanity-check putting something which is not wearable on the rack:
	if the noun is the gel or the noun is the tub:
		make no decision;
	else:

[Originally the rock was described as "hefty and jagged, like the result of a volcanic event". Then I went to Kilauea on vacation and picked up some volcanic rocks, and they were the lightest rocks I've ever lifted. So that had to go. I decided that Brock's supportive personality, rather than his unpredictability, was the thing I wanted to express in the rock description.

geology.about.com lists basalt as a fairly dense rock, denser than limestone, marble, or granite; other weighty options included peridotite, gabbro, and diorite, but I figured those would be less familiar to the player.]

The description of the rock is "Heavy, dark, and roughly hexagonal, like a slice of basalt column.". The rock is essential.
	The scent-description is "mud".

Before putting the restoration gel on the rock when the rock is in a container (called the holder):

The roc is a rideable animal.
The initial appearance is "[if the location is Sunning Deck][roc-aboard][otherwise]The roc towers over us, looking smarter than a bird has the right to look.[end if]".
The description of the roc is "The bird is enormous[if the location is indoors], so big it seems incredible that it can even fit into the room[end if]. Brock is a tall man, but not nearly this tall. Its eyes are bright and (if [we] [are] not reading too much in) ironically clever; its plumage a little like an eagle's, if an eagle were made many times larger and feathered in a kind of sleek, luminous black."

[Every turn when the roc is in the Sunning Deck and the Sunning Deck is the location:

Section 16 - Tale


A tale is r-abstract. The heft of a tale is 0. The description of a tale is "It begins with 'once upon a time,' and the letters scroll up delicately through the air when [we] start to read. It weaves a narrative as follows: [paragraph break][i][generated tale][/i]".

Report examining the tale:
	record "Propper Rosehip award for talespinning" as an achievement;
	continue the action.

[Here we want to suggest a timeless but suitably Atlantean fairy tale, which we assemble in pseudo-Proppian fashion. Themes hint at rampant xenophobia, problems with distribution of wealth, concerns about class and democracy, the roles of science and superstition, ambivalence towards organized religion, layers of polytheistic as well as Christian culture, superstitions about language, uncertainty about the behavior of abstract objects and beings, and other problems that presumably were emerging over the past several centuries of Atlantean history.

At the same time, the tale is generative and intentionally reveals its generative nature, rather than just being a cycling set of pre-written tales, for two reasons. One, I like some of the curious themes or idiosyncracies that arise from the automatic generation (e.g., a hero who defeats a robber... using something he himself stole; the hero gives up literacy to appease an angry demon and is rewarded with a mask of words...); two, many of the game's abstracts do have a randomized, unstable quality and I wanted to continue that feel.

Conceptually, this passage also owes a little bit to Andrew Plotkin's Matter of the Monster and to some blog comments from Ian Millington about generating semi-random content. It's not, of course, a particularly elegant implementation of that concept.

Contrast the inciting fable, which needs to have one and just one form.]

The description of the tat is "It looks like the end-of-day leftovers from a particularly ill-fav[our]ed yard sale. What's not broken is dirty, and what's not dirty is in terrible taste. There's a mechanical pencil with no lead, and a kiddie pool that leaks; a stained tablecloth that once had a pattern of squid tentacles on it; a bobble-headed doll representing the head player of the Maiana football team thirteen years ago."

[I was very very tempted to put the tea in a vintage tea cup, as I spent part of the summer collecting such cups on eBay for a party, and I had in the process cluttered my brain with a lot of useless information about historical tea cup brands and patterns that clearly needed to go somewhere. But then I realized that it would be kind of a bother implementing the cup separately from the tea, and inconsistent with how other liquid manifestations usually work, and so I decided not to after all. The reader is invited to picture her choice of Aynsley, Paragon, Wedgewood, Royal Albert, Limoges, Lomonosov, etc. tea cup as she wishes.]

Check waving the letter-remover at the tea when the current setting of the letter-remover is "t":

[The tick is a problem. It's technically an animal, but it shouldn't act like animals act because it's too small. In fact, it's so small that it's not realistic for the player to be able to hold onto it for long. Fortunately, though, the stick isn't an essential item in the game, so we can afford to lose it. This is one place where I have Alex really step in and take some action if the player doesn't do something: either we change the tick back into the sticky in a few moves, or we lose it.]

Tick-removal is a scene. Tick-removal begins when the tick is enclosed by the location.

Every turn during tick-removal:
	say "[one of]That is, of course, if it doesn't attach to our skin and give us Lyme disease[or]I guess what I'm trying to say here is that I don't want our very own pet tick[or]...Okay, sorry, there's something I just need to do here. Blame my phobias if you will[stopping]."

Instead of putting the tick on something:
	say "If [we] set it down, it'll be lost for good."

Instead of inserting the tick into something:
	say "If [we] set it down, it'll be lost for good."

Instead of dropping the tick:
	say "If [we] set it down, it'll be lost for good."

When tick-removal ends painfully:
	if the restoration gel is marked-visible:
		try putting the restoration gel on the tick;
	otherwise:
		now the tick is nowhere;
		say "Whoops, I seem to have lost our tick! Oh well. Here's hoping it has a juicy and eventful life."

The description of the ticket is "It reads ADMIT ONE in large black letters."
