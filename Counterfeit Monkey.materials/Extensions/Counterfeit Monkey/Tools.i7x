Chapter 1 - The Letter-Remover

Section 1 - Normal Behavior

Definition: a thing is irretrievable:
	if it is the player:
		no;
	if it encloses the player:
		no; [because we've got a different disaster lined up to deal with this.]
	if it is the letter-remover:
		yes;
	if it is the tub:
		yes;
	if it encloses an essential thing:
		yes;
	no.

Check waving the letter-remover at something irretrievable:
	unless the second noun is the letter-remover or the second noun is the locker:
		abide by the don't change irretrievable rules for the second noun.

The don't change irretrievable rules is an object-based rulebook.

A don't change irretrievable rule for a thing (called the item):
	if the item is the tub or the item is the letter-remover or the item is the restoration gel:
		say "It would be a bad idea to change the form of [the item]. [We] might not be able to get it back.";
		the rule fails;
	if the item is a closed opaque container:
		say "It would be a bad idea to change the form of [the item]. [We] might not get the contents back.";
		the rule fails;
	if the item is a person:
		make no decision;
	say "First [we] try to remove anything useful from [the item]. [run paragraph on]";
	let essential-list be the list of essential things enclosed by item;
	let taken-list be a list of things;
	let holder-list be a list of things;
	repeat with the target running through essential-list:
		silently try taking the target;
		if the player carries the target:
			add target to taken-list;
			add holder of target to holder-list;
		otherwise:
			repeat with N running from 1 to the number of entries in taken-list:
				move entry N of taken-list to entry N of holder-list;
			the rule fails;
	if the number of entries in taken-list is at least 1:
		say "[We] take [taken-list with definite articles].[paragraph break]";
	if the item is irretrievable:
		say "Since [the item] [contain] [the essential-list with definite articles], it might be a bad idea to change [regarding the item][their] form. [We] may not be able to get the contents back.";
		the rule fails.

Instead of waving the letter-remover device:
	say "Whoa, whoa! Just waving that thing around without an exact aim could do a lot of damage. Wave it AT something, or don't wave it at all."

The letter-remover device is a thing. It is essential. Understand "letter remover" or "plastic device" or "device" or "blunt-nosed" as letter-remover.
	The description of the letter-remover device is "It is a blunt-nosed plastic device, about the size of a laser pointer, that can be waved at things to remove excess [current setting in upper case]s. It is not very powerful, and often fails against large items. On the other hand, it has a wide range of action: it can be set to any letter [we] choose."
	The introduction is "These are, if not exactly cheap, hardly unknown in Atlantis."
	Understand "remover" as the letter-remover device.
	The printed name of the letter-remover device is "[current setting in upper case]-remover". The indefinite article of the letter-remover device is "your".

After printing the name of the letter-remover device while taking inventory:
	if the letter-remover device is upgraded:
		if the letter-remover device is creature-enabled:
			say " (upgraded to handle animates and abstracts)";
		otherwise:
			say " (upgraded to handle abstracts)";
	otherwise if the letter-remover device is creature-enabled:
		say " (upgraded to handle animates)".

The letter-remover device has some text called current setting. The current setting of the letter-remover device is "r".

To say a-an (item - letter-remover device):
	if the current setting of the letter-remover device is listed in the vowel-starting list:
		say "an";
	otherwise:
		say "a";
	say " [letter-remover device]";

The vowel-starting list is a list of texts that vary. The vowel-starting list is { "a", "e", "f", "h", "i", "l", "m", "n", "o", "r", "s", "x" }.

A small knob is part of the letter-remover device. Understand "dial" as the small knob when the lock is marked invisible. The description is "It is very delicately made and stamped with letters around the circumference. The currently up-facing letter is [the current setting of the letter-remover device]."

After printing the name of the small knob:
	say " on your [letter-remover]".

Before doing something to the small knob:
	now the noun is the letter-remover device;
	try the current action instead.

Understand "[letter-remover] [something]" as waving it at.

After reading a command:
	say "[run paragraph on]";
	let N be "[the player's command]";
	replace the regular expression " [current setting of the letter-remover]-remover" in N with " letter-remover";
	change the text of the player's command to N;
	say "[run paragraph on]";

After reading a command when the player can touch the letter-remover:
	let N be "[the player's command]";
	if N matches the regular expression ".-remover":
		if N matches the regular expression "(.*) (.)-remover (.)*":
			replace the regular expression "(.*) (.)-remover (.)*" in N with "\2";
		otherwise if N matches the regular expression "(.*) (.)-remover":
			replace the regular expression "(.*) (.)-remover" in N with "\2";
		otherwise:
			replace the regular expression "(.)-remover.*" in N with "\1";
		if the current setting of the letter-remover exactly matches the text "[N]":
			make no decision;
		if the number of characters in N is greater than 1:
			make no decision;
		now N is "[N in lower case]";
		unless N matches the regular expression "\l":
			say "Only the 26 letters of the English alphabet are available to the letter-remover.";
			reject the player's command;
		now the current setting of the letter-remover is "[N]";
		now the letter-remover is changing;
	otherwise:
		say "[run paragraph on]";



The letter-remover can be static or changing. The letter-remover is static.

Sanity-check doing something when the noun is the letter-remover and the letter-remover is changing:
	now the letter-remover is static;
	if the player does not carry the letter-remover:
		silently try taking the letter-remover;
		if the player does not carry the letter-remover:
			stop the action;
	say "[one of][We] smoothly, and almost without thinking about it, reset your device to be [a-an letter-remover][or][We] run our thumb over the dial, setting the device to [a-an letter-remover][or][We] reset the device to [current setting of letter-remover][stopping]. [run paragraph on]";
	if taking:
		say paragraph break;
		stop the action.

Understand "set [something]" as vaguely setting. Vaguely setting is an action applying to one thing.

Check vaguely setting:
	say "That is insufficiently exact [--] [we][']d have to set [the noun] to something." instead.

Instead of vaguely setting the letter-remover:
	say "You have to set it to a specific letter, as in SET [letter-remover] TO X."

Understand "set [letter-remover device] to [text]" or "tune [letter-remover device] to [text]" or  "turn [letter-remover device] to [text]" as tuning it to.  [Understand "set [something] to [text]" as tuning it to.] Tuning it to is an action applying to one carried thing and one topic.

Check tuning it to:
	if the noun is not the letter-remover device, say "[The noun] cannot be tuned." instead.

Check tuning it to:
	let N be "[the topic understood]";
	if the number of characters in N is greater than 1:
		say "[We] can only tune the letter-remover device to one letter at a time." instead;
	now N is "[N in lower case]";
	unless N matches the regular expression "\l":
		say "Only the 26 letters of the English alphabet are available to the letter-remover." instead.

Carry out tuning it to:
	now the current setting of the letter-remover device is the topic understood.

Report tuning it to:
	say "You flick our thumb over the small knob: [we] now have [a-an letter-remover device]."

Report tuning the letter-remover to something for the third time:
	say "[first custom style][bracket]You can also tune the device just by using another name for it: referring to the device as, for instance, an N-remover will automatically set it to n.[close bracket][roman type][paragraph break]"

Understand "remove [thing] from [thing]" as removing it from.

Understand "remove [text] from [something]" or "letter-remove [text] from [something]" as letter-removing it from. Letter-removing it from is an action applying to one topic and one visible thing.

Carry out letter-removing the topic understood from something:
	let noun-text be "[topic understood]";
	if the number of characters in noun-text is greater than 1:
		if the player's command includes "remove":
			[The parser has likely misunderstood our attempt to remove objects from the second noun as letter-removing. Try to give a reasonable response to this.]
			if the second noun is a closed openable opaque container:
				say "[The second noun] [are] closed." instead;
			if the player's command includes "remove all/everything from":
				if the first thing held by second noun is nothing:
					try empty-removing the second noun instead;
				otherwise:
					try removing the first thing held by the second noun from the second noun instead;
			say "[We] can't see any such thing [in-on the second noun]." instead;
	try tuning the letter-remover to the topic understood;
	try waving the letter-remover at the second noun.

Understand "wave [something preferably held] at/toward/over/around/on/across [thing]" as waving it at. Waving it at is an action applying to one carried thing and one visible thing.

Understand "use [letter-remover] on [thing]" as waving it at. Understand "point [letter-remover] at [thing]" as waving it at.

Understand "wave [something preferably held] at/toward/over/around [any locally-present room]" as waving it at.

Understand "use [letter-remover] on [any locally-present room]" as waving it at. Understand "point [letter-remover] at [any locally-present room]" as waving it at.

Check waving something at something:
	if the noun is not a letter-remover device,
		say "Nothing interesting happens." instead.

Check waving something at a room:
	if the noun is not a letter-remover device,
		say "Nothing interesting happens." instead;
	say "If we were to succeed in transforming the entire room [--] mercifully, that's unlikely, given the power requirements [--] but if we did succeed, you and I would be rendered inanimate, along with any other hapless passers-by." instead.

Check waving the letter-remover device at the letter-remover device:
	say "This is physically impossible as well as pointless." instead.


[Check waving the letter-remover device at something which encloses the player:
	say "A safety override prevents [the letter-remover] from working on objects which actually contain the operator at the time."]


The letter-remover device can be upgraded. The letter-remover device is not upgraded.
The letter-remover device can be creature-enabled. The letter-remover device is not creature-enabled.

The waving it at action has an object called the generated object (matched as "creating").
The waving it at action has a truth state called the letter absence.

Setting action variables for waving the letter-remover device at an object which is not the letter-remover device:
	if the second noun is a direction:
		make no decision;
	now the letter absence is false;
	let Y be the single-letter-hash of the current setting;
	if hash code of second noun is 0:
		reset hash code of second noun;
	let comparison number be the hash code of the second noun with Y removed;
	if comparison number is the hash code of the second noun:
		now letter absence is true;
	otherwise:
		let starting text be "[second noun]";
		now starting text is "[starting text in lower case]";
		if the second noun is yourself:
			now starting text is "alexandra";
		replace the regular expression "[current setting]" in the starting text with "";
		now generated object is the letter-remover device;
		let match-list be a list of things;
		repeat with item running through things in repository:
			if comparison number is the hash code of the item:
				let goal text be "[printed name of the item]";
				let goal text be "[goal text in lower case]";
				if the goal text is the starting text:
					if second noun proffers item:
						now the generated object is item;
						make no decision;
					add item to match-list;
		unless match-list is empty:
			now the generated object is substitute from match-list;
		if the generated object is the letter-remover device:
			now the disappointment text is the starting text.

The disappointment text is some text that varies.

[When creating something new by letter-removing, the code could previously pick an object from the repository that was already part of another "creation chain", i.e. it was already proffered by another object. This would make the resulting item part of two different creation chains, which could make it disappear out of your hand when you gelled or letter-transformed something seemingly unrelated. (Though in practice I only saw this happen with the as.) The rule below avoids this by picking a preferred object from a list of matches.]

[The jury is still out on whether this could ever happen when using the other letter-transformation tools.]

To decide what thing is the substitute from (matchlist - a list of things) (this is the intelligent substitution rule):
	let L be the number of entries in matchlist;
	if L is greater than 1:
		let high-scorers be a list of things;
		let high-score be 0;
		repeat with N running from 1 to L:
			let contender be entry N in matchlist;
			let scr be 500;
			let prof-list be the list of things that proffer contender;
			remove contender from prof-list, if present;
			if prof-list is not empty:
				decrease scr by 150;
				[Something else proffers the contender. Don't choose this.]
			if the first thing held by contender is something:
				increase scr by 100;
				[The contender contains something. Prefer this.]
			if contender is r-abstract and the letter-remover is not upgraded:
				decrease scr by 100;
			if contender is a person and the letter-remover is not creature-enabled:
				decrease scr by 100;
			if scr is high-score:
				add contender to high-scorers;
			otherwise:
				[This is the new highest score. Clean out the old ones.]
				if scr is greater than high-score:
					now high-score is scr;
					now high-scorers is {};
					add contender to high-scorers;
		[sort high-scorers in random order;]
		[Choose an object from those with the highest score]
		decide on entry 1 in high-scorers;
	otherwise:
		decide on entry 1 in matchlist.

[Check waving the letter-remover at a foreign-tongued thing:
	say "[The letter-remover] squeaks as though frightened[one of]. Apparently encountering objects that aren't in English generates its own alarm tone[or] by the foreign-language [second noun][stopping]." instead. ]

Check waving the letter-remover at a direction:
	say "'[The second noun]' is a concept, not a concrete thing, and it eludes letter-removers." instead.

Check waving the letter-remover at something:
	if the letter absence is true:
		say "The letter-remover finds no [current setting of the letter-remover] in [the second noun]." instead.

Check waving the letter-remover at the restoration gel:
	abide by the don't change irretrievable rules for the restoration gel.

Check waving the letter-remover at something which is enclosed by the player:
	if the player wears the second noun:
		try taking off the second noun;
		if the player does not carry the second noun:
			say "Altering one's clothes while they're on can have some unfortunate side effects." instead;
	if the player does not carry the second noun:
		try taking the second noun;
		if the player does not carry the second noun:
			let enclosure be the holder of the second noun;
			say "It isn't a good idea to change objects while they're [in-on the enclosure]." instead.

Check waving the letter-remover at something creating the letter-remover:
	if the disappointment text matches the regular expression ".*\s.*":
		let presumed second noun be "[second noun]";
		let C be the number of words in presumed second noun;
		let presumed second noun be "[word number C in presumed second noun]";
		now the prior named object is the second noun;
		say "The device buzzes, puzzled. It has tried to create a '[disappointment text]': evidently '[presumed second noun]' [are] too tightly bound to [their] modifiers and can't be manipulated separately[one of]. This is a serious problem in my field of study, incidentally[or][stopping][if the second noun is fixed in place or the second noun is scenery]. Or perhaps it just doesn't have sufficient power to handle [the second noun][end if]." instead;
	otherwise:
		if disappointment text is "":
			say "The device emits a distinctive triple tone, which means that the requested action would have entirely destroyed the target object. There are safety overrides to prevent it doing such a thing." instead;
		otherwise:
			say "The device buzzes, puzzled. It is unable to create anything recognizable called '[disappointment text]'[if the second noun is fixed in place or the second noun is scenery], or perhaps it just doesn't have sufficient power to handle [the second noun][end if]." instead.

Check waving the letter-remover at something creating a crude thing:
	say "A safety override mechanism kicks into play before the operation is complete; the device plays a short snickering noise. Evidently its one joy in life is detecting and foiling practical jokes." instead;

Check waving the letter-remover at something creating a person when the letter-remover device is not creature-enabled:
	say "[The second noun] flickers and there is a brief image of [a generated object] in [regarding the second noun][their] place, but a legal override kicks in: [a-an letter-remover] is hardware-crippled to prevent generating any living creature." instead;

Check waving the letter-remover at something creating an r-abstract thing when the letter-remover device is not upgraded:
	say "[The second noun] flickers and there is a brief image of [a generated object] in [regarding the second noun][their] place [--] the concept strangely embodied in a physical form [--] before the power gives out[one of]. I guess your device there just isn't tuned to reify abstracts[stopping]." instead;

Check waving the letter-remover device at something (this is the checking for danger rule):
	abide by the dangerous destruction rules for the second noun;
	[abide by the dangerous construction rules for the generated object.]

Check waving the letter-remover at a room creating the letter-remover:
	say "[The letter-remover] is powerless to make [the second noun] into anything called '[disappointment text]', but perhaps this is to be expected considering the size of the target. The device is after all a mere portable device with limited resources."

Check waving the letter-remover at something (called target) creating an uncontained fluid thing (called the liquid):
	if the target is in a container (called target holder) and the number of things in target holder is greater than 1 and target holder is not the synthesizer:
		say "[The liquid] would make a real mess in [the target holder]." instead.

Check waving the letter-remover at a room creating something which is not the letter-remover:
	abide by the dangerous destruction rules for the second noun;
	[abide by the dangerous construction rules for the generated object.]

Carry out waving the letter-remover device at something:
	let destination be the holder of the second noun;
	move the generated object to destination;
	if the second noun is part of destination and the generated object is not stuck:
		now the generated object is in the location;
	if the generated object is stuck:
		now the generated object is part of destination;
	move the second noun to the repository;
	if the generated object proffers the second noun and the generated object is not original: [we've managed to create a loop in the generation, as in lee+ass, leases, lass, ass]
		now every thing which proffers the second noun proffers the generated object;
		now the generated object does not proffer the generated object;
	otherwise:
		now the generated object is not proffered by anything;
		now every thing which proffers the second noun proffers the generated object;
	if an essential thing (called source) proffers the generated object:
		now the generated object is essential;
	[if something (called source) which encloses an essential thing proffers the generated object:
		now the generated object is essential; ]
	[so that 'take it' or whatever will work, after we've made something: ]
	set pronouns from the generated object;
	carry out the caching scope activity with the player;
	record "using the letter-remover" as achieved;
	let current be the current setting of the letter-remover;
	remove current from the list of remaining letters, if present;
	if the number of entries in the list of remaining letters is 0:
		record "Admiral Thoureaux award for removing every letter of the alphabet in one playthrough" as an achievement;
	[add the current setting of the letter-remover to the list of removed letters, if absent. ]

The list of remaining letters is a list of text that varies. The list of remaining letters is { "a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i", "j", "k", "l", "m", "n", "o", "p", "q", "r", "s", "t", "u", "v", "w", "x", "y", "z"}.


Report waving the letter-remover device at something:
	if the scent-description of the generated object is not "":
		say "With a distinct whiff of [the scent-description of the generated object], [the second noun] [turn] into [a generated object]. [run paragraph on]";
	otherwise:
		say "There is [one of]a flash of psychedelic col[our]s[or]a mad-scientist cackle[or]a [pastel-color] cloud[or]a flash of [primary-color] light[or]a smell of anise[or]a distinct spearmint flavor[at random], and [the second noun] [turn] into [a generated object]. [run paragraph on]";
	abide by the dangerous construction rules for the generated object;
	try examining the generated object instead.

Report waving the letter-remover device at something creating a seen thing:
	say "[The second noun] [give] way to the now-familiar [generated object].";
	abide by the dangerous construction rules for the generated object instead.




Chapter 2 - The Homonym Paddle

[The original homonym paddle is never wielded by the player; access to it is entirely controlled via requests to the bartender at the Fleur d'Or drinks club. This is only partly to limit the player's options. It's also, narratively, to establish the restricted nature of powerful letter tools, and to create occasions for more engagement with other characters (since a lot of this sequence involves essentially secret manipulations of the synthesizer in the seminar room).

We do write a few of the routines to be more general-purpose, however, because a homonym function also becomes available in the workshop during the very end of the game.]

The homonym paddle is carried by the bartender. It is long and strong. The description is "Who had the idea of hitting things to make them swap with their homonyms, I couldn't guess. Nonetheless the toy [--] shaped like a ping-pong paddle and formed of coral-col[our]ed rubber [--] enjoyed a brief vogue in the 80s.

To prevent theft, the paddle is attached to the bartender's wrist by a thin steel cable and bracelet."

To homonym-paddle (N - a thing):
	move the N to the repository;
	let X be the player;
	if N is:
		-- a screwdriver:
			let X be the screwdriver-drink;
		-- a gimlet:
			let X be the gimlet-drink;
		-- a rusty nail:
			let X be the rusty-nail-drink;
	unless X is the player:
		record "getting a product of the homonym paddle" as achieved;
		move the X to the dor-bar-top;
		set pronouns from X;
		now X does not proffer X;
		now N proffers X;
		carry out the caching scope activity with the player;
		say "[one of]The bartender fishes around in the toolkit for [a N] and sets it on the bar with a flourish. [The patron] is watching this transaction in an interested way.

'This is good,' says the bartender, winking at us both (all?). 'You'll like this.' She raises the homonym paddle unnecessarily high in the air and smashes it down hard on [the N].

There's a crackling discharge of purple-toned lightning, and in place of [the N], a cocktail of the same name now sits on the bar. A few of the customers applaud.[or]'Right,' she says. She reaches into the toolkit for [the N]. 'This will be even better than last time,' she says. Then she tosses [the N] in the air and hits it with the paddle as though serving underhand at ping-pong.

Incredibly, the resulting cocktail glass winds up perfectly balanced on the paddle rather than flying into the wall, which is what would happen if I tried the same thing.

She grins at us and sets the glass down neatly on the bar.[or]This time she lays the paddle down on the bar and drops [the N] onto its surface. The purple lightning-ball obscures [the N] for a moment, then recedes to reveal the cocktail.[stopping]";


To decide what thing is the homonym-match of (target - a thing):
	let old text be "[target]";
	let old text be "[old text in lower case]";
	repeat with item running through things in the repository:
		if the hash code of the item is the hash code of target:
			let new text be "[item]";
			let new text be "[new text in lower case]";
			if new text is old text:
				if the description of the item is not the description of the target:
					decide on item;
	decide on player.

Chapter 3 - The T-inserter

The T-inserter machine is a fixed in place container in the Sensitive Equipment Testing Room. The initial appearance is "At the cen[ter] of the room is a gleaming new T-inserter Machine[if the machine is non-empty], currently containing [a random thing in the T-inserter machine][end if][one of]. This is a state of the art device: letter removal has been well understood for decades, but insertion is much more dangerous and difficult, fraught with ambiguity[or][stopping]." The description is "Made of brushed steel, it resembles an industrial espresso machine, with a space in which to insert items. A dozen small nozzles poke into this space, and the grate beneath is ready to drain off any superfluity of T-ness. There is a tiny brass plate near the base of the machine."

Understand "space" and "grate" and "inserter" as the machine. The carrying capacity of the T-inserter Machine is 1.

The brass plate is part of the machine. Understand "base" as the brass plate. The description is "DENTAL CONSONANTS LTD [--] ABSOLUTELY NO PALATALS OR LABIALS [--] GUARANTEED".

The small nozzles are part of the machine. Understand "jets" or "conical" or "sharp" or "tips" or "tip" or "business end" as the nozzles. The description is "They have sharp conical ends, like cake-decorating tips. If [we] look closely, [we] see that the business end of each is cut out in a t-shape, each in a different font." Instead of doing something other than examining to the nozzles: say "Better leave repairs to a qualified professional."

Sanity-check inserting something (called item) into the t-inserter when the t-inserter contains the item:
	try silently taking the item;
	if the player carries the item:
		say "[We] momentarily lift [the item] out of [the t-inserter] and then drop [them] back in.";
		move the item to the t-inserter;
		try teeing the item instead;
	otherwise:
		do nothing instead.

Sanity-check inserting something irretrievable into the T-inserter:
	abide by the don't change irretrievable rules for the noun.

After inserting something into the T-inserter:
	try teeing the noun.

teeing is an action applying to one thing. The teeing action has an object called the goal-object (matched as "to"). The teeing action has a number called the t-count. The teeing action has a list of objects called the possible-goals. The teeing action has a list of texts called the possible-goal-texts.

[We can't guess where to stick our ts in order to arrive at other objects. And because the starting object might already contain one or more instances of T, we can't just strip the Ts from our goal objects and see if they match. What we have to do instead is go through the name of all our target objects, subtract the name of the starting object, and see if all that is left is a string of ts. This gives us an opportunity to do some detailed work with individual characters:]

Setting action variables for teeing something:
	let starting text be "[printed name of the noun]";
	let Y be the single-letter-hash of "t";
	let comparison number be the hash code of the noun with Y added;
	repeat with item running through things in repository:
		if the comparison number is the hash code of the item:
			let the goal text be the name of the item minus the name of the noun;
			let matching success be true;
			if the goal text is "0", let matching success be false;
			let X be the number of times the goal text matches the regular expression "<tT>";
			[say "[item]: [goal text] (success [matching success])[line break]";]
			if the matching success is true and goal text exactly matches the regular expression "<tT>+":
				let name text be "[item]";
				unless name text is listed in possible-goal-texts:
					if the goal-object is multiply-made or the goal-object is nothing:
						now the goal-object is the item;
						now the t-count is X;
					add item to the possible-goals, if absent;
					add name text to possible-goal-texts.

To decide what text is the name of (Y - an object) minus the name of (X - an object):
	let starting text be "[X]";
	let starting text be "[starting text in lower case]";
	let goal text be "[Y]";
	let goal text be "[goal text in lower case]";
	let character count be the number of characters in the goal text;
	let matching success be true;
	let next be 1;
	let max be the number of characters in the starting text plus one;
	repeat with i running from 1 to character count:
		if next is less than max:
			if character number i in the goal text is character number next in the starting text:
				replace character number i in the goal text with "-";
				increase next by 1;

Chapter 4 - The Synthesizer

The plexiglas case is a thing in the Language Studies Seminar Room. It is transparent, closed, openable, lockable, and locked. It is fixed in place. The initial appearance is "A massive plexiglas case takes up one corner of the room." The description is "The case is made of very thick protective plastic on a metal frame[if the screws are part of the plexiglas case and the plexiglas case is lockable]. It is thoroughly locked shut; I don't think [we][']ll have any luck with normal forms of approach. However, plexiglas is a cuttable substance with the right tools, and then there are the screws at the back[otherwise if the plexiglas case is not lockable]. The lid has been compromised by a saw, and the case is now permanenty open[end if]."

Test plexibug with "tutorial off / get plexiglas" in the Language Studies Seminar Room.

Chapter 5 - The Spinner

Section 1 - Physical Description

[ The function of the spinner is to reverse a word and produce the result, assuming that anything does result: YAM / MAY, DOG / GOD, EEL / LEE, LEER / REEL, PANS / SNAP, PIT / TIP, SAP / PAS are all creatable using the spinner. Accordingly, the items it produces are a strict subset of the items that can be created using the anagramming gun; besides that, it's not portable and doesn't fire at a distance, so it has some other restrictions as well. This makes it more of a toy than most of the other letter devices to be found in the game.

The spinner belongs to a very early stage of the game's development. Originally the plan was to have the spinner as a decoration in the Fleur d'Or, and the player would need to distract the staff there in order to gain access to it and use it. (There was also a turntable that would move one letter from the front to the back or back to front, as in APE > PEA or ARC > CAR.)

In practice, however, the small number of possibilities associated with these tools didn't yield very many interesting puzzles, so the spinner was commented out for most of the game's development period.

It owes its reappearance in the game to the LEER/REEL easter egg. While it would have been possible to arrange this easter egg in the Bureau, using the anagramming gun to complete the change (and indeed it was initially implemented that way), it felt odd to have a projector in the Bureau but not one in the cinema. In particular, I was concerned that creating an achievement such as Projectionist would feel misleading and annoying to many players if the projector in question were concealed inside the Bureau rather than being in the obvious place for a projector to be.

So the projection booth was added to the cinema and the spinner reintroduced to make it possible to create the reel before the anagramming gun was rediscovered. (By the time the player gets the anagramming gun, it is impossible to reach the cinema again.)

That in turn necessitated other changes as follow:

-- placing another object in the projection booth to make it seem other than wholly pointless when the player first finds it; so the jotter is moved there from the crate in the crawlspace and the notes on the jotter are changed;
-- creating an initial object to sit on the spinner to demonstrate its functionality, which was going to be a figurine of a god/dog; this was a very oblique reference to Apollo Agyieus, a guardian of doorways traditionally worshipped in aniconic form as a conical pillar garlanded with flowers. Both the god and the dog are guardian figures.
-- removing some other distracting text from Roget Close so that the spinner is allowed to stand out more;
-- coming up with more immediate functionality for the spinner so that it won't seem such a red herring

...and at this point I decided to convert the spinner into a proper puzzle of its own, one in which the gate unlocks only if you give the spinner something that it can convert. So at that point the god/dog had to be removed to let the player solve this herself; so I buried the dog in Monument Green and associated a different achievement with finding it.

This is all a lot of bother just for the sake of adding an achievement/easter egg that most players probably won't notice. In each case, though, I felt as though the result of the design fix was a richer, more interesting setting with more playful manipulation available. Adding the yam to the game also provided another purpose for the farmer, who had been relatively useless (other than as the provider of the totally optional lime) ever since he stopped selling chard.  ]

The spinner is part of the spinner-gate. It is a supporter. Understand "sculpture" or "mirror" or "statue" or "pedestal" or "cone" as the spinner.
	The description of the spinner is "The base of the sculpture is a cone about four feet tall. On top of that is a flat circular pedestal, and there is a mirror that rotates around the outer circumference. The mirrored surface faces inward, so that it is sometimes reflecting [if the spinner is non-empty][the random thing on the spinner] on the pedestal[otherwise]whatever might be on the pedestal (currently nothing)[end if] and sometimes concealing [if the spinner is non-empty][them][otherwise]it[end if] from view.".
	The printed name of the spinner is "pedestal".
	The carrying capacity is 1.

Sanity-check switching on the spinner:
	say "The sculpture appears to be permanently on." instead.

Sanity-check switching off the spinner:
	say "If there is an off-switch, it's nowhere we can see it." instead.



Section 2 - Spinning Functionality

Every turn when the location is Roget Close and the spinner is non-empty (this is the spin the spinner rule) :

	let max characters be the number of characters in the goal text;
	let substitute text be some text;
	repeat with Z running from 1 to max characters:
		now substitute text is "[character number Z in goal text][substitute text]";
	now goal text is substitute text;
[	say "[substitute text]";]
	[since the spinner's likely to be undoing its own work, allow it to get the original back.]
	if the chosen article is proffered by something (called the source) which is not the chosen article:
		if the hash code of the source is the hash code of X:
			let item text be "[source]";
			now item text is "[item text in lower case]";
			if the goal text is item text:

					now the chosen article is the item;
	if the chosen article is not X:
		abide by the dangerous destruction rules for X;

			say "[paragraph break]The gate clicks open. ";
		record "using the spinner" as achieved;

Chapter 6 - The Turntable

[The turntable is a supporter. It is scenery. The carrying capacity is 1. The description is "A swiftly rotating platform able to go clockwise or anticlockwise. It is currently set to [rotation-direction]." Understand "table" or "turn table" as the turntable.

Rotation-direction is a kind of value. The rotation-directions are clockwise and anticlockwise. Understand "counterclockwise" and "widdershins" as anticlockwise. The turntable has a rotation-direction.

Understand "set [turntable] to [rotation-direction]" as setting it to the direction. Setting it to the direction is an action applying to one thing and one rotation-direction.

Instead of vaguely setting the turntable:
	if the turntable is clockwise, try setting turntable to the direction anticlockwise; otherwise try setting the turntable to the direction clockwise.

Carry out setting it to the direction:
	now the rotation-direction of the turntable is the rotation-direction understood.

Report setting it to the direction:
	say "[The turntable] now goes [the rotation-direction of the turntable]."

Every turn when the turntable is visible and something is on the turntable:
	if not looking:
		follow the turntable-turning rule;
		say paragraph break.

This is the turntable-turning rule:
	let the chosen article be a random thing on the turntable;
	let X be the chosen article;
	let goal text be "[printed name of the X]";
	if the turntable is clockwise
	begin;	[put first letter at the end, as in ape --> pea]
		if the goal text matches the regular expression "(.)(.*)", replace the regular expression "(.)(.*)" in goal text with "\2\1";
	otherwise;	[put last letter at the front, as in arc --> car]
		if the goal text matches the regular expression "(.*)(.)", replace the regular expression "(.*)(.)" in goal text with "\2\1";
	end if;
	repeat with item running through things in the repository
	begin;
		if the goal text exactly matches the regular expression "[item]", now the chosen article is the item;
	end repeat;
	if the chosen article is not X
	begin;
		now the chosen article is not proffered by anything;
		now everything which proffers X proffers the chosen article;
		now everything which is on the turntable is in the repository;
		move the chosen article to the turntable;
		say "[if looking]After the turntable does its work,[otherwise]The turntable whirls faster than we can follow, and when it is done[end if] there [is-are a list of things on the turntable]. ";
	otherwise;
		if looking
		begin;

		otherwise;
			say "The turntable spins for a moment, [one of]then dies down again[or]without effect[or]without changing [the list of things on the turntable][at random]. ";

	end if.

Rule for disclosing exterior of something (called special-target) which is on the turntable:
	say "[The special-target] [are] spinning rapidly [rotation-direction of the turntable] on [a turntable][if a thing is on the turntable], together with [a list of mentionable things which are on the turntable][end if]. [run paragraph on]";

	say "On [the turntable], [a list of things on the turntable] [spin] [rotation-direction of the turntable]. [run paragraph on]";
	follow the turntable-turning rule. ]

Chapter 7 - Authentication Scope

An authentication scope is a kind of thing.

The secretary carries an authentication scope called the Regulation Authentication Scope.

In the backpack is an authentication scope called a monocle. The description of the monocle is "This is no mere fashion accessory. It is the very top grade of authentication scope, designed for people who have to use them all day, and normally available only to employees of the Bureau of Orthography. If [we] look through the monocle at something, [we] can see its true nature, regardless of spelling changes." The monocle is wearable. The monocle is illegal.
	The introduction of the monocle is "You like that? I thought you might be impressed. My father got it for me. 'For research,' he said, but I think he knew I just coveted them. At any rate, you're not the only one with equipment."
	The monocle is essential.
	The monocle covers the face-area.

Last after examining something when the player wears the monocle:
	if the noun is not the monocle:
		try looking at the noun through the monocle;
	continue the action.

After wearing the monocle:
	if the player is not enclosed by the kayak:
		say "Everything turns computer-monitor green when viewed through our right eye. And staring fixedly at anything will turn up its authenticity status."

Understand "stare at [something]" or "stare fixedly at [something]" as examining.

The description of an Authentication Scope is usually "It looks like a small hand-held telescope, or perhaps a very posh kaleidoscope: all brown leather and brass fittings, and a good heft indicating quality materials. The sophisticated electronics are all concealed within. If [we] look through the scope at something, [we] can see its true nature, regardless of spelling changes."

Instead of searching a scope:
	try looking at a random thing in the location through the noun.

Understand "look at [something] through/with/using [something preferably held]" as looking at it through.
Understand "examine [something] with/through [something preferably held]" as looking at it through.
Understand "look through/with/using [something preferably held] at [something]" as looking at it through (with nouns reversed).

Looking at it through is an action applying to one visible thing and one carried thing.

Check an actor looking at something through something:
	if the second noun is not an Authentication Scope
	begin;
		if the actor is the player, say "[The second noun] won't give us a clear view of [the noun]." instead;
		stop the action;
	end if.

Check an actor looking at something through something:
	if the noun is an authentication Scope and the second noun is the noun
	begin;
		if the actor is the player, say "[We] can't look through [the noun] at itself." instead;
		stop the action;
	end if.

		stop the action;
	end if.

Carry out looking at a mirror through something:
	say "[The noun] [are] real enough, and [the second noun] pings approvingly.

But laid over the reflection we can see the two of us as we used to look: you a little shorter than our current body, me taller and male and needing a shave. I'm not sure whether it makes me feel better or worse to see us like that." instead.

Test reflecting-bug with "x reflection / wear monocle / x reflection / look at reflection through monocle" holding the monocle in sigil street.

Carry out looking at it through:
	if the noun is original or the noun is disguised:

		say "[The second noun] [ping] happily as [we] sight [the noun] with the crosshairs.";
	otherwise:

After the secretary looking at the undisguised pass through a scope:
	say "The secretary raises the scope to look at the pass. Her eyes widen at the blatant forgery. 'Stay right there, buddy,' she says. From her tone of voice, this is obviously the most entertaining thing that has happened to her this fiscal year.

Chapter 8 - The Origin Paste

A thing can be disguised or undisguised. A thing is usually undisguised.

After someone looking at a disguised thing through an authentication scope:
	say "[The person asked] frowns, but the scope makes no sound."

Instead of looking at a disguised thing through an an authentication scope (called the scope):
	say "[The scope] fails to make any sound or response at all, but no green image forms revealing the true nature of [the noun]."

The player is disguised.

The Origin Paste is a disguised illegal thing on the bar-top. The origin paste is essential. The indefinite article is "some".

The origin paste can be won or unwon. The origin paste is unwon.

Instead of taking the Origin Paste when the Origin Paste is unwon:
	say "Without even glancing away from what he's doing, Parker the barman says, 'That's reserved.'"


The description of the Origin Paste is "A cake of pale purple: it is able to disguise letter-reformed objects so that they don't look like obvious frauds, or even show up under authentication.

The only problem with it is the distinctive smell."
	The introduction is "The Origin Paste is powerful stuff, and worth a good bit of money."
	The scent-description is "overpowering French lavender".

Instead of eating or tasting the paste:
	say "[one of]I once tried some lavender sorbet at a swank little Milanese gelato shop. This is like that, only less icy and more chalky.[or]Sorry, it's not an experience I care to repeat.[stopping]".

Instead of smelling the player:
	say "[We] smell of lavender. It's not as bad a reek as it was earlier, though. No one would think it was anything but soap."

To say don't remove gel from tub:
	say "[We] better leave [the gel] in there until [we] have decided what to put it on."

Instead of empty-removing the tube:
	try squeezing the tube;

Instead of removing the tube from the tube:

Before doing something when the noun is the tube or the second noun is the tube:
	if the subcommand of the tube matches the text "gel" or the subcommand of the tube matches the text "restoration gel":

		abide by the don't change irretrievable rules for the second noun.


[Because it's possible to change something into an object that becomes fixed in place in the backpack, or too heavy to move...]

Before putting the restoration gel on something which is in a container (called the box):
	if the second noun is proffered by an uncontained fluid thing (called the liquid):
		if the number of things in the box is greater than 1 or the number of things proffered by the second noun is greater than 1 and the box is not the synthesizer:

Instead of someone trying touching the restoration gel:
	if the person asked can touch the restoration gel:
		gel-convert the person asked;
		rule succeeds.

Definition: a thing (called itself) is original if it proffers itself and it is proffered by exactly one thing.

To gel-convert (item - an object):
	if the item is not original:
		abide by the dangerous destruction rules for the item;
		let destination be home for the item;
		now everything which proffers the item is in the destination;
		[play the sound of gel splort;]

		say "[one of][paragraph break]I'm starting to understand how you got into all the places you got into. Not that I judge you or your line of work, of course. [or][stopping][paragraph break]";
		carry out the caching scope activity with the player;
		record "using the gel" as achieved;
		[It's possible, in rare cases, for something to be its own parent: AS+COT -> SCOT -> COT leaves a result that is one of its own earlier ingredients. So we need to account for that: ]
		if the item does not proffer the item:
			move the item to the repository;
	otherwise:
		say "Alas, nothing happens.".

To decide what object is home for (item - a thing):

		let the destination be the location;
	decide on destination.

[Stuck objects are those that should not fall off the thing they are part of when recreated by gel-conversion]

Chapter 10 - The Anagramming Gun

Section 1 - Pistols and Shooting

[This is lightly adapted from the Technological Terror example in the manual. SHOOT is an annoying verb because there are several different equally valid syntaxes in English and we want to account for all of them, and make good guesses if the player types just SHOOT TARGET or SHOOT WITH GUN.]

A pistol is a kind of thing. A pistol can be loaded or unloaded. A pistol is usually loaded.

Shooting it with is an action applying to one visible thing and one carried thing. The shooting it with action has an object called the detritus.

Check shooting something with something which is not a pistol:
	say "[We] are insufficiently armed." instead.

Check shooting something with an unloaded pistol:
	say "[The second noun] [are] not loaded." instead.

Check shooting a pistol (called target pistol) with the target pistol:
	say "[The noun] doesn't bend that way." instead;

[Disambiguate the restoration gel rifle sensibly with the tub of gel.]
Does the player mean shooting something with the restoration gel:
	it is very unlikely.

Does the player mean shooting something with the tub:
	it is very unlikely.

Does the player mean shooting something with a pistol:
	it is very likely.

Does the player mean shooting the restoration gel with:
	it is very unlikely.

Does the player mean shooting the tub with:
	it is very unlikely.

Does the player mean doing something with the restoration-gel rifle:
	it is unlikely.

Sanity-check shooting the restoration gel with:
	if the restoration-gel rifle is marked-visible and the player's command does not include "gel/at with/gel":
		if the player's command includes "shoot/fire gel" or the player's command includes "shoot/fire restoration gel":
			replace the matched text with "shoot rifle";
			now the reborn command is the substituted form of "[player's command]";
			now sp reparse flag is true instead;

Does the player mean shooting something enclosed by the player with: it is very unlikely.
Does the player mean shooting a pistol (called P) with P: it is very unlikely.

Understand "shoot [something] with [something]" as shooting it with.
Understand "fire at [something] with [something]" as shooting it with (with nouns reversed).
Understand "shoot [thing] at [thing]" as shooting it with (with nouns reversed).
Understand "fire [thing] at [thing]" as shooting it with (with nouns reversed).

Understand "shoot [something unwielded]" as shooting it with.

[Thanks to Matt W for this code]
Definition: a thing is unwielded if it is not a pistol enclosed by the player.

Rule for supplying a missing second noun while shooting when the player carries a pistol (called the firearm) and the noun is not the firearm:
	unless the noun is the restoration gel and the firearm is the restoration-gel rifle:
		say "(with [the firearm])[command clarification break]";
	now the second noun is the firearm.

Test rifle-ownership with "tutorial off / shoot gel" holding the restoration-gel rifle.

Section 2 - Anagramming Gun

The anagramming gun is an unloaded pistol on the display-platform. Understand "anagrammer" as the anagramming gun. The description is "Anagramming guns are illegal now, of course, because of their desperately unpredictable behavi[our]. This one is a huge heavy thing, though not quite an artillery piece, because of the colossal amounts of power required and all the stabil[ize]rs needed to try to collapse the letters back down to a single phrase."

Section 3 - Loading the Gun

Sanity-check inserting the bullets into a gun:
	try loading the noun into the second noun instead.

Understand "load [something] with [something]" as loading it into (with nouns reversed).
Understand "load [something] into [something]" as loading it into.
Understand "load [anagramming gun] with [anagram bullets]" as loading it into (with nouns reversed).
Understand "load [anagram bullets] into [anagramming gun]" as loading it into.

Loading it into is an action applying to one carried thing and one thing.

Definition: a thing is ungunlike if it is not a pistol.

Check loading something into something ungunlike:
	say "[The second noun] [are] not a gun." instead.

Check loading something which is not the anagram bullets into something:
	say "[The noun] [are] not ammunition." instead.

Carry out loading the anagram bullets into the anagramming gun:
	now the anagram bullets are nowhere;
	now the anagramming gun is loaded.

Report loading the anagram bullets into the anagramming gun:
	say "I would not know how to do this, but you have sufficient expert skill that we've got the gun loaded up in no time." instead.

Instead of searching the anagramming gun:
	if the anagramming gun is loaded:
		say "There are still some more anagramming bullets within.";
	otherwise:
		say "The gun is unloaded."

Understand "unload [something]" as unloading. Unloading is an action applying to one thing.

Sanity-check unloading:
	if the noun is not a pistol:
		say "[The noun] [are] not a gun." instead;
	if the noun is the anagramming gun and the anagramming gun is unloaded:
		say "[The anagramming gun] [are] already empty." instead;
	otherwise:
		say "[We] see no reason to disarm us unnecessarily." instead.


Section 4 - The Anagram Effect of Shooting

Sanity-check shooting something irretrievable with the loaded anagramming gun:
	abide by the don't change irretrievable rules for the noun.

Sanity-check shooting the loaded anagramming gun with the loaded anagramming gun:
	say "It is impossible to aim the gun at itself." instead.

Check shooting the pills with the loaded anagramming gun:
	if the pills are in a container (called the box) and the number of things in the box is greater than 1 and the box is not the synthesizer:
		say "The spill would make a real mess in [the box]." instead.

Check shooting something with the loaded anagramming gun:
	let initial key be the anagram key of the noun;
	now detritus is the noun;
	let the possibles list be a list of things;
	repeat with item running through things in the repository:
		if the hash code of the item is the hash code of the noun:
			[say "[item]: ";]
			let initial name be "[noun]";
			let initial name be "[initial name in lower case]";
			let comparison name be "[item]";
			let comparison name be "[comparison name in lower case]";
			let comparison key be the anagram key of the item;
			[say "[comparison key]";
			say "[noun]: [initial key]"; ]
			if comparison key is the initial key and the initial name is not the comparison name:
				add the item to the possibles list; [* We make a list because otherwise, for any set of anagrammed objects in the repository, we will always just swap back and forth between the first two that are implemented and never get to the others.]
	let max be the number of entries in the possibles list;
	if max is 0:
		say "The gun fires ruggedly into [the noun], but is unable to make anything interesting out of [the initial key]. [The noun] recoalesce[s] into [their] original form." instead;
	otherwise:
		now detritus is entry max of the possibles list.

To decide what list of text is the anagram key of (n - an object):
	let anagram key be a list of text;
	let starting form be "[n]";
	if n is yourself:
		now starting form is "alexandra";
	let count be the number of characters in starting form;
	repeat with i running from 1 to count:
		let char be "[character number i in starting form]";
		let char be "[char in lower case]";
		if char is not " ":
			add char to anagram key;
	sort anagram key;
	decide on anagram key;

Check shooting something with the anagramming gun:
	abide by the dangerous destruction rules for the noun.

Carry out shooting something with the anagramming gun:
	move the detritus to the holder of the noun;
	if the noun is part of the holder of the noun:
		now the detritus is in the location;
	move the noun to the repository;
	if the detritus proffers the noun and the detritus is not original:
		now every thing which proffers the noun proffers the detritus;
		now the generated object does not proffer the detritus;
	otherwise:
		now the detritus is not proffered by anything;
		now every thing which proffers the noun proffers the detritus;
	if an essential thing (called source) proffers the detritus:
		now the detritus is essential;
	[ if something (called source) which proffers the detritus encloses an essential thing:
		now the detritus is essential; ]
	carry out the caching scope activity with the player;
	record "using the anagramming gun" as achieved;

Report shooting something with the anagramming gun when the detritus is unseen:
	say "The gun fires ruggedly into [the noun], which shatter[s] and then reform[s] as [the detritus]. [run paragraph on][detritus description][paragraph break]";
	set pronouns from the detritus;
	abide by the dangerous construction rules for the detritus instead.

Report shooting something with the anagramming gun:
	say "The gun fires ruggedly into [the noun], which shatter[s] and then reform[s] as [the detritus].";
	abide by the dangerous construction rules for the detritus instead.




Chapter 11 - Restoration gel rifle

The restoration-gel rifle is an essential pistol. The printed name of the restoration-gel rifle is "restoration gel rifle". Understand "restoration/gel/handgun" as the restoration-gel rifle.

[we want use of the regular gel to win, if possible]
Does the player mean putting the restoration-gel rifle on:
	it is very unlikely.

The description of the restoration-gel rifle is "A rifle that shoots pellets of restoration gel, converting objects from a distance. Guns like this are illegal to carry unless you're Bureau. They can inflict unpleasant bruises if they encounter nothing to convert and absorb the energy."

Sanity-check shooting something irretrievable with the restoration-gel rifle:
	unless the noun is the tub or the noun is original:
		abide by the don't change irretrievable rules for the noun.

Instead of shooting the Origin Paste with the restoration-gel rifle:
	say "[We] fire the gun into the Origin Paste. There is a violent thump, a suffocating cloud of lavender and mint fumes, and then the paste is much the same as before, just smaller."

Carry out shooting something with the restoration-gel rifle:
	say "[We] shoot [the restoration-gel rifle] at [the noun]. ";
	gel-convert the noun.

Instead of shooting the player with the restoration-gel rifle:
	if atlantida-woman is seen:
		say "[We] optimistically fire [the restoration-gel rifle] at [ourselves], but it doesn't make any difference. We're stuck this way, for good.";
	else:
		say "There's a real chance [we][']d come apart into a you and a me. And [we] can't afford that right now."


Chapter 12 - Britishizing Goggles

[Originally included as a joke, and a harmless one, because it was going to be in the tools exhibit and the player was never going to be able to get in there. Later, though, when I made the tool exhibit possible to break into, it became necessary to go back and implement cosmetic changes throughout the text. And then it felt like the player was getting the goggles too late in the game for them to be really fun as a toy, so I moved them much earlier, to the antiques shop.

Let this be a lesson to you, children. Jokes can cost a lot of implementation time.]

Some Britishizing goggles are a wearable thing. The description is "An experimental prototype that (from the perspective of the viewer only) adds -u- into words ending in -or, and reverses -er into -re wherever possible. Subjects wearing the [Britishizing Goggles] generally began to develop implausible accents and to have better than usual success wooing American tourists. Otherwise, the goggles are not much use: like my monocle, they don't affect the actual form of an object in any way.

The surplus stock were mostly given away as rewards to supporters of public television, and the Bureau discouraged even recreational use in the 1980s as they began to make progress towards greater linguistic purity."

Chapter 13 - The Umlaut Punch

[Because the player shouldn't stop having fun things just because it's late in the game. The anagramming gun was a pretty ambitious thing to add and brought in a lot of extra objects, but I wanted the Bureau basement to feel rich in possibilities even if I couldn't afford to make another half dozen genuinely useful objects. Hence the umlaut punch, which works, but just for a moment -- so there's no risk of it expanding the object trees.

Originally there was no gameplay value to the punch, but later when the generator room was introduced, I decided I wanted to include a power cord, and the power chord concept was born. ]

The description of the umlaut punch is "A very heavy, solid object manufactured in Stuttgart. A wire basket holds the item to be punched; two sharp metal tines descend into the basket at the moment of use." Understand "wire basket" or "basket" or "sharp" or "metal" or "tines" as the umlaut punch. The heft of the umlaut punch is 3. The umlaut punch is a container.


Understand "punch [something]" as umlaut-punching when the umlaut punch is marked-visible.

umlaut-punching is an action applying to one thing.

Understand "punch [something] in/with [umlaut punch]" as inserting it into.

Sanity-check umlaut-punching:
	try inserting the noun into the umlaut punch instead.

Check inserting a heavy thing into the umlaut punch:
	say "[The noun] [are] far too substantial to fit into the wire basket." instead.

Sanity-check inserting the player into the umlaut punch:
	say "[if story viewpoint is second person singular]You decide against it[otherwise]I'm not putting my hand in that thing[end if]." instead.

Check inserting something into the umlaut punch when the umlaut punch contains something (called the blockage):
	say "[The blockage] [are] already in the wire basket, and it doesn't take two things at a time." instead.

Report inserting a strand into the umlaut punch:
	say "[We] put [the noun] into the wire basket of the umlaut punch. There is a hum as the punch warms up, then a bang! as the tines come down sharply, tattooing [the noun].[paragraph break]";
	say "For a moment [we] glimpse the teen girl band Haïr [--] starring Big Haïr, Scary Haïr, Bed Haïr, and Skyblue Haïr [--] whose big hit, 'You Got Me In Curlers (And I Liked It)', has unfortunately now dropped out of the charts.

But the effect fades almost instantly." instead.

The power chord is an r-abstract noisy thing. The initial appearance is "A power chord vibrates ominously in the air." The description of the power chord is "The chord [--] played as though by electric guitar [--] almost makes it sound as though heavy machinery is in use in here."
	The introduction of the power chord is "Having a leftover like this is… unusual. A sign of spare reification energy in this area, maybe. Like radiation left over from some really high energy abstraction work."

Instead of listening to the power chord:
	say "The repeated power chord makes it sound as though some heavy equipment is being used in here even when it's not."

Chapter 14 - The Catalan punt volat Needle

[This is a wholly unnecessary toy that exists (a) to give the player something to fiddle with briefly if stuck with the anagramming gun; and (b) to suggest a wider world of language use beyond the shores of Atlantis.]

The description of the Catalan punt volat needle is "An infinitely delicate tool designed to slip between two Ls. It has no application in English."

Sanity-check inserting the Catalan punt volat needle into something:
	try poking the second noun with the noun instead.

Check poking something with something:
	if the player does not carry the second noun:
		try taking the second noun;
	if the player does not carry the second noun:
		stop the action.

Check poking something with something which is not the Catalan punt volat needle:
	say "[The second noun] [are] not very suitable for the purpose." instead.

Check poking the Catalan needle with the Catalan needle:
	say "[The noun] doesn't bend that way." instead.

Carry out poking something with the Catalan punt volat needle:
	let sample be text;
	let sample be "[noun]";
	now sample is "[sample in lower case]";
	if sample matches the regular expression "(.*l)(l.*)":
		say "The needle slips into place, trying to construct '[text matching subexpression 1]·[text matching subexpression 2]'. It fails, however, to make any recognizable word out of this, and the needle wire grows hotter and hotter in our hand as it tries to fix the change. Finally [we] have to pull out." instead;
	otherwise:
		say "There's nowhere for the needle to slide in, because there are no paired Ls in [the noun]." instead.

Understand "use [catalan punt volat needle] on [something]" as poking it with (with nouns reversed).
Understand "poke [something] with [catalan punt volat needle]" as poking it with. Poking it with is an action applying to one thing and one carried thing.

Understand the commands "pierce" and "stick" and "penetrate" as "poke".

Chapter 15 - The Workshop Platform

The programmable dais is an enterable supporter in the Workshop. Understand "machine" or "equipment" or "platform" or "big" or "black" or "metal" or "round" or "machinery" or "coil" or "coils" as the dais.
	The initial appearance is "A programmable dais sits in the middle of the room. It has the raw look of lab equipment rather than a nice smooth commercial instrument."
	The description is "It's a round black metal platform with substantial stabil[izing] coils visible underneath, five or six feet in diameter. This is experimental lab grade letter equipment, ferociously powerful, insanely dangerous."

After examining the programmable dais:
	say "The dais has [a list of things which are part of the dais]."

The big lever is part of the programmable dais. The big lever is a device. The description is "One of those big heavy levers you see at demolitions. You won't be tripping this thing by accident."

Understand "flip [something]" as pushing. Understand "use [big lever]" as pushing.

Sanity-check pulling the big lever:

[Joke responses. These duplicate, more or less, code for the synthesizer above; inelegant, but there aren't enough of these jokes to be worth a more elaborate implementation of synthesis generally that would take them into account.]

Instead of switching on the big lever when the switch-setting of the massive switch is synthesize and the programmable dais supports the roll and the programmable dais supports the rock:

					otherwise:
						say "[The programmable dais] glows deep red. Almost at once [the result] [are] lying on the surface. [result description][line break]" instead;
			say "[The programmable dais] goes red, then dims again. Apparently it can't find a homonym to fit [the list of things *in the programmable dais]." instead;

The massive switch is part of the programmable dais. The description is "A large black switch with a red arrow painted on it. There are two stops, labeled with black marker on tape: [i]swap homonym[/i] and [i]synthesize[/i]. It is currently set to [switch-setting of the massive switch]."

The switch-setting is a kind of value. The switch-settings are swap homonym and synthesize. The massive switch has a switch-setting. The switch-setting of the massive switch is swap homonym. Understand "swap" or "homonym" or "swap homonym" as swap homonym. Understand "synthesise" as synthesize.

Chapter 16 - The Cryptolock aka Vowel Rotator

[ The cryptolock is a variation on the idea of the spinner introduced much earlier in the game.

The puzzle here is completely different depending on whether you're playing hard mode or easy mode.]

The cryptolock is a scenery container in the Generator Room. It is fixed in place. The printed name of the cryptolock is "brushed steel bucket". Understand "brushed" or "steel" or "container" or "bucket"  as the cryptolock.

The cryptoswitch is a device. The cryptoswitch is part of the cryptolock. The printed name of the cryptoswitch is "reverse switch". Understand "reverse" or "switch" as the cryptoswitch.

Report switching on the cryptoswitch:
	say "The switch thunks over into the Reverse position." instead.

The description of the cryptolock is "Attached to the machine is a [cryptolock], with insulated walls; it looks like a large version of an ice bucket for chilling sparkling wines.

Around the outside of the bucket are all sorts of odd gears, sprockets, parts, and bits, which have been attached in a haphazard way with bolts, wire, and duct tape. Presumably this does something to items placed in the bucket.

At the lip of the bucket is a switch labeled REVERSE. The switch is currently [if the cryptoswitch is switched on]on[otherwise]off[end if]." The carrying capacity of the cryptolock is 1.

The sprocket-bits are part of the cryptolock. Understand "odd" or "gears" or "sprocket" or "sprockets" or "parts" or "bits" or "part" or "bit" or "bolt" or "wire" or "duct" or "tape" as the sprocket-bits. The description of the sprocket-bits is "They're all different metals and component sizes, as though scavenged from other machines. But for what? It would take a much better engineer than I am to guess that."

Sanity-check inserting something (called item) into the cryptolock when the cryptolock contains the item:
	try silently taking the item;
	if the player carries the item:
		say "[We] momentarily lift [the item] out of [the cryptolock] and then drop [them] back in.

		[run paragraph on]";
		try silently inserting the item into the cryptolock instead;
		say "[run paragraph on]";
	otherwise:
		do nothing instead.

Check inserting something into the cryptolock when the cryptolock contains something (called the blockage):
	try taking the blockage;
	if the blockage is in the cryptolock:
		stop the action.

Check inserting something into the cryptolock when the heft of the noun is greater than 3:
	say "[The noun] [are] too big to fit into [the cryptolock]." instead.

A dangerous construction rule for something (called the target):
	if the target is in the cryptolock and the heft of the target is greater than 3:
		now the target is in the Generator Room;
		say "There is a churning noise from within [the cryptolock] as [a target] [are] formed within. The finished [target] [are] too big to fit in the bucket, however, and [fall] out during the process of formation. "

Test bucket-size with "put coat in bucket / wave a-remover at coat / get cot / put cot in bucket" holding the coat in the Generator Room.

[In hard mode, each vowel becomes the next consonant in the alphabet and each consonant becomes the next vowel. This has the effect of vastly reducing the number of possible letters in output, and is a bit tricky to think through; but it is possible to get LAMB > OBOE.

To figure out whether the game supplied any objects that could fruitfully be encrypted this way, we ran the encryption on every object in the game and inspected the results for things that were really words.]

To decide what text is the hard encryption of (X - a thing):
	let goal text be "[printed name of the X]";
	let goal text be "[goal text in lower case]";
	replace the text "a" in goal text with "B";
	replace the text "b" in goal text with "E";
