Volume 8 - Tests

Chapter 0 - Skipping breaks

No pauses is a truth-state that varies. No pauses is initially false.

To custom-pause the game:
	if no pauses is false:
		pause the game;
	otherwise:
		say "[line break]Please press SPACE to continue.[paragraph break]"

To custom-wait for any key:
	if no pauses is false:
		wait for any key.

The File of Tests is called "testing".

[Start automated test if File of Tests exists.]

A last after starting the virtual machine rule (this is the automated testing rule):
	if the File of Tests exists:
		say "[first custom style][bracket]Test mode active. No waiting for key presses, deterministic randomness[close bracket][roman type][paragraph break]";
		seed the random-number generator with 1234;
		now no pauses is true;

Understand "pauses on" as on-pausing. On-pausing is an action out of world.
Understand "pauses off" as off-pausing. Off-pausing is an action out of world.

Carry out on-pausing:
	say "[first custom style][bracket]No-pause mode inactive. Will wait for key presses.[close bracket][roman type]";
	now no pauses is false.

Carry out off-pausing:
	say "[first custom style][bracket]No-pause mode active. No waiting for key presses.)[roman type]";
	now no pauses is true.

Understand "random-seed [number]" as reseeding. Reseeding is an action out of world applying to one number.
Carry out reseeding:
	say "[first custom style][bracket]Random-number generator seeded with [the number understood].[close bracket][roman type]";
	seed the random-number generator with the number understood.

[Running this one is a major, major undertaking, producing thousands of lines of transcript output to go through. But it turned up a huge number of small bugs and implementation gaps as well: items that weren't marked plural when they should have been, animals that weren't set to the correct class, objects that should have a strong smell or sound associated but didn't.

Other errors discovered this way:

	— >KISS MOTHER originally produced the response "Tempting, but no,"
	— the Gengis Khan-style Tartar smelled like deodorant
	— so did the Victorian papa and papas
	— PUSH TOTS NORTH had a come-back about how pushing people in directions only worked on small children
	— the tamale description sort of hinted that the contents might be interesting, then didn't react if you searched it
	— all sorts of things could be waved that weren't really wave-worthy
	— the stopcock and petcock were both described as not something we can open/close, when they are in fact forms of valve
	— the rock ballad wasn't marked as abstract, so you could wave it and rub it and so on
	— it was possible to "play" other items like an instrument any time the oboe was in the same location

Understand "pound repository" as testing repository. Testing repository is an action applying to nothing.

Carry out testing repository:
	move the repository to the location;

		try object-analyzing the item.

[showing]

Understand "pound showing" as testing showing. Testing showing is an action applying to nothing.

	move the repository to the location;
	now the repository is open;
	now every synthesizable thing is in the repository;

Section 4 - Construction Tests

[ This section is of chiefly archaeological interest.

These commands were written not to verify behavior already in the game but to help identify things that could or should be implemented. 'list sources' identifies portable in-game objects that ought to be analyzed for their word derivatives.

'pound anagrams' helped to work out which objects in the game were anagrams of which others, and is very slow because it was implemented before the hash code was in; but it only needed to run once. This was more of a viability test than anything else.

'list syntheses' was to help with brainstorming about what synthetic objects should be made, though it does not account for objects with interleaved letters (again, because it was implemented before the hash code was added).

]

Carry out listing all outcomes:
	repeat with item running through synthesizable things:
		say "[item]: [encryption of item], [back encryption of item], [hard encryption of item], [back hard encryption of item][line break]".


[The list length thing was added because I was investigating a different puzzle style -- one in which the player needed to make a word-object with specific characteristics such as length and consonant/vowel pattern, which would then function as a key in a particular type of Bureau lock. This turned out to be hard to construct and boring to solve, so I scrapped the concept.]

Understand "list length [number]" as listing lengths. Listing lengths is an action applying to one number.

Carry out listing lengths:
	repeat with item running through portable things:
		let starting form be "[item]";

			next;
		if item is part of something which is fixed in place:
