Volume 5 - The Repository of All Things Possible

Chapter 1 - Major Contents

Section 1 - The Repository Defined

[The repository contains all things that the player might create in the course of the game. This gives us a safe place to move things into and out of when checking items we're manipulating.]

The repository is a container.

Section 3 - Individual Items Broken Down By Product

[ For each source object, we work out the plausible changes on what that item could be made into. Scenery objects for the most part are not changeable, and neither are most objects with attached adjectives, except using the anagramming gun in the end-game. So that cuts down somewhat on the chaos.

Nonetheless, there's still an awful lot to account for. To figure out what needed to be implemented for the letter-remover, I used some perl-created subsets of the Scrabble word list; for instance, I had one reference file that consisted of nothing but valid letter removals, of the form

geniuses with i removed -> genuses

Then whenever I needed to check derivations, I could search this file for the object I was adding to the game (recursively, of course), and see what letter removals were possible.

A similar wordlist covered words that could be constructed from pairs of other words, for use with the synthesizer. In the process I learned a lot of new words: I'd never heard of ASSART before, for instance, which is the crime of stealing someone's plants.

To come up with words that could be used with the spinner, I also made a bit of use of this list of semordnilaps:

	http://kgfamily.com/files/semordnilaps.html

For the vowel rotator, I went the other way and ran rotations on everything that already existed in the game world, then culled this to produce a short list of things that were real objects. The algorithm produced a long and surprisingly pleasing (to me, at 1 AM) list of entries such as

	bokono buttums
	iligently wontir polut
	...
	swetch
	wend betch
	...
	bellcuck
	bentem
	bendot
	...
	shromp cuckteol
	shattlicuck
	spollegi
	sockist uffel
	...
	etc. for hundreds of lines

...which seemed just consistent enough to belong to their own language or possibly to some dialect form of English, while still being essentially silly. Who are these sockists anyway, and why do they keep deluging us with their uffel?

For anagrams, I mostly relied on the internet anagram server website.

The good thing about the anagramming gun is that, while it can produce prodigious numbers of possibilities, I didn't have to implement them as thoroughly, because anagramming is not a completely deterministic process. For instance, the accent flipper would anagram to the flint crepe cap and back again, and the player would have no way to try to specify any other possible variant anagrams. So it was only necessary to provide multiple anagrams of the same phrase if I thought those objects would be interesting or funny to have in the game; otherwise, I just picked the single item that seemed most amusing or tractable and included that.

Despite these attempts at rigor, beta-testers did still discover a number of items that weren't handled. I declined to include the 'vaginal foam sop' that one could hypothetically create out of the the map of Slangovia, but I did incorporate a number of others, from the embarrassingly-obvious-how-did-I-leave-that-out COAT > TACO to the more esoteric COUNTERWEIGHT > TOWERING CHUTE. I did very much want the player at this stage of the game to be encouraged to try the anagramming gun widely -- especially on things with long names -- so that he'd be in the right frame of mind when he came up against Atlantida in the end.]
