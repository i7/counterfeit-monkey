Part 1 - The James Bond Part of Town

Chapter 1 - Long Street

Section 1 - LS North

South of Roundabout is Long Street North.

Literal Restaurant is a facade in Long Street North. It fronts east. It is scenery. The description is "A framed menu announces the specials for tonight: Lamb with a Deplural[ize]d Apricot Reduction, Armagnac-Drunken Capon, and Lobster Tail Nestled in Bubbles of Flav[our]-Abstract."

Instead of looking toward Roundabout:
	say "That direction is just a chaos of traffic and bad signage."

Long Street North is a proper-named and southern road. Understand "long street n" as Long Street North. The description is "Long Street is lined on each side with a double-row of tall, an[ae]mic palm trees that bend towards one another many feet overhead. This corridor continues some considerable distance south."

Some anemic palm trees are a backdrop. They are in Long Street North and Long Street South. The description is "The only foliage comes in a clump high above. The effect is distorted and unnatural, and I say that having lived with them all my life. They are trees in the same sense that ostriches are birds." The printed name is "an[ae]mic palm trees". Understand "palms" or "anaemic" as the anemic palm trees.

South of Long Street North is Long Street South. Long Street South is a  proper-named southern road. Understand "long street s" as Long Street South. The description is "Long Street is lined on each side with a double-row of tall, an[ae]mic palm trees that bend towards one another many feet overhead.

The Canadian Embassy is a facade in Long Street South. It fronts east. It is scenery. The description is "The embassy is the largest foreign embassy here: Canadians do a lot of business with Atlantis, but the Québécois require special permission to enter, so there's a call for substantial clerical work.

Understand "concrete" or "windows" or "solid" or "block" or "slit-shaped" or "slit" or "window" or "slit shaped" or "slits" as the Canadian Embassy.

The description is "The logo on the outside is from Landison's, a popular toy store on the island. It's probably closed today, so this would have been bought earlier [--] possibly even as a present for Serial Comma Day."

Check waving the letter-remover at the shopping bag when the current setting of the letter-remover is "s":
	say "The device buzzes, puzzled. Evidently there is not enough Atlantean interest in brewing to make 'hopping bag' a recogn[ize]d item in itself." instead.

A ball is a thing in the shopping bag. The description is "Made of blue and white rubber, and decorated all over with a pattern of random letters in different sportive fonts."

The jigsaw-puzzle is a privately-named thing in the shopping bag. The printed name is "jigsaw". Understand "jigsaw" or "puzzle" as the jigsaw-puzzle. The description is "The boxed puzzle displays an execution scene, with several pro-British traitors from the 1820s being lined up before the deplural[ization] cannon. It was thought a considerable punishment to be forced to share a body and consciousness with others."

Instead of opening the jigsaw-puzzle:

The hotel has recently had a face lift, with the silly old ornamentation pried off, and smooth modern material laid down in its place. Blue tiles pick out the shapes where pilasters used to be, and panels of frosted glass have been fitted to cover the statue niches.

If you are my mother, you call this style Atlantean Postmodern. Less kindly, it is something from the sweaty dreams of an upscale swimming-pool installer."

I got it out because it provides a general overview of adjectival 'adherence' [--] that is, how and when an adjective is so much part of the name of something that it can be affected by tools like your [letter-remover], and when it is purely incidental.

I see I may be losing you. Shall I put this in layman's terms? >>";
	if the player consents
	begin;
		say "[line break]The short version is: I want to design a language with spelling and pronunciation selected so that valuable resources like food, water, and clothing can easily be made from available resources and pollutants such as plastic garbage and seawater.

There are major problems in constructing such a language because ideas like 'pure' and 'potable' and 'healthy' tend to be specified by adjectives rather than by nouns [--] English doesn't have one colloquial word that means 'pure water', for instance. But I believe that a correctly constructed language that incorporated the concept of 'pure water' into a single word would be exceptionally powerful and might transform the third world.";
	otherwise;
		say "[line break]Okay, then.

In general, strongly-adhering adjectives produce problems by preventing conversions that might otherwise be possible; conversely, it is difficult to make objects with particular characteristics because those characteristics are described by weakly-adhering adjectives.

The point is: it is possible to use linguistic tools to create water. It is [i]not[/i] reliably possible, at least in American English, to use those tools to create potable water, because 'potable' is a weakly-adhering adjective describing a statistically uncommon trait. This means that linguistic reification is helpless to solve water supply problems, even in third-world regions using a high-efficacy language. For that matter even when a word has a strongly-adhering adjective, the interference of that adjective usually just makes the object impossible to reify at all.

What [we] need, therefore, is a language with nouns that uniquely specify substances['] desirable traits: 'potable' or 'pure' water should be named something distinct from adulterated forms of H2O, and so on.

Have I bored you enough yet? >>";
		if the player consents, say "[line break]Right, sorry. Well, you get the general idea, anyway.";
		otherwise say "[line break]Scientific jargon does, of course, exist to specify objects uniquely, but there are two problems. One is that most chemical and biological terminology is used by such a small subset of the population that it has near-zero linguistic efficacy: creating a substance by formula requires an amount of energy roughly on par with pointing a w-remover at Aberystwyth. This is not a realistic solution to resource problems.

The second difficulty is that even with well-known exceptions such as 'H2O', the formula is not usually not a linguistic subset of the formula of another widely available and well-known substance.

Hence the need for a new language with nouns designed based on careful scientific research into the primary needs and resources of living in a given region. This language could then be systematically taught to everyone dwelling in that area, causing permanent economic uplift.

'Systematically taught' is a bit of a problem, since it would take massive funding and effort to make the language known widely enough to gain linguistic efficacy. And there would be significant issues in not totally crowding out indigenous languages and thus destroying an existing culture.

But I have high hopes, assuming I can ever get out of this repressive little burg and make my case to one or more of the major world relief organ[ization]s.";

The introduction is "I should have taken it back to the library [--] I [i]meant[/i] to take it back to the library [--] but there just wasn't time.

The description of the sturdy iron gate is "The campus as a whole is walled and gated because of the amount of linguistic research that happens inside. This is a very lightweight form of security, more symbolic than anything, with much more significant protections on the really powerful materials[if the ring is not handled].

I have the student ring that opens this back in my apartment. I just wasn't expecting to need to go in there ever again[ring-fetch][end if].".

Out-direction of University Oval is northwest. [Palm Square]

That's further east, though, and the buildings here around the Oval are mostly from the enormous expansion of the university in 1911-1940, when the publication of the New Orthodox Orthography caused a rapid expansion in language-related disciplines.

My own building is Samuel Johnson Hall, to the south."

s-johnson-hall-exterior is a facade in University Oval. The printed name is "Samuel Johnson Hall". It fronts south. The initial appearance is "Immediately south of here is the building where I spend most of my time, Samuel Johnson Hall.".
	Understand "building" or "samuel" or "johnson" or "hall" as s-johnson-hall-exterior.
	The description is "When it was built in the [']30s, the whole purpose was to prove to the rest of the faculty the tremendous value of the new field of language studies (as opposed to language engineering, a field long valued for its ability to produce tools and, more importantly, weapons).

Consequently, [s-johnson-hall-exterior] was built to impress: a blind windowless front of white stone rising grandly from the pavement; an oppressive [portico] that makes entering figures look tiny."

The portico is part of s-johnson-hall-exterior.
	Understand "blind" or "windowless" or "front" or "white stone" or "stone" or "oppressive" or "statues" or "relief" or "statue" or "letter e" or "letter t" or "letters" or "e" or "t" or "shining" or "bronze" as the portico.

	try the activist saying hello to the player.]

Report the activist saying hello to the player:
	queue environment-offer instead.

Instead of giving bills to the activist:
	say "Your mind rebels at the thought. You need this money [--] we both do. Without it, we haven't a hope of making our way in another country."

'No entry except for supporters.'[or]This time two friends of the activist appear beside her. 'Supporters only,' they say.[or]The TOXI WASTE power people prevent you. Maybe we'd better listen to what they have to say.[stopping]".

Section 2 - Samuel Johnson Hall

South of University Oval is Samuel Johnson Hall. The description of Samuel Johnson Hall is "This is the main building for Language Studies. [one of]This is not to be confused with Language Engineering, which is the department that handles devices for the manipulation of language-objects; it is also not to be confused with Linguistics, English Literature, or Comparative Literature, all of which have their own buildings and faculties. Language Studies applies itself to questions of linguistic efficacy chiefly at a social and anthropological level.

That's to say that we study how the ability to change things based on their names affects daily life and society.

[or][stopping]The department office, with several professorial offices leading off of it, is to the [southeast]. To the [southwest] is the seminar room, where many of the upper-level courses occur, and which also contains the department library; downstairs is the basement, where the graduate students and junior instructors are kept."

Understand "photo" or "picture" or  "professor" or "frame" as the framed photograph.
	The printed name is "framed photograph of Professor Waterstone".
	The description is "The Shaply Chair is not named after the famous suffragette Phyllida Shaply, but after her considerably less famous or interesting descendant Lawrence Shaply, who was well-placed within Dental Consonants Ltd. when it started up and subsequently had buckets of money with which to endow university chairs.

Nonetheless, this position is a point of considerable pride for Professor Waterstone, and gets him many invitations to speak both here and abroad, which he takes terribly seriously. (More to the point, the government permits him to attend.)

This may explain the particularly expansive grin on Waterstone's face in this image. Usually his pleasure is expressed more moderately."

Section 3 - Seminar Room

Southwest of Samuel Johnson Hall is the seminar door. The seminar door is a closed lockable locked door.  The seminar door is scenery. The description of the seminar door is "It's sturdy, because sometimes valuable equipment is stored in the room beyond. That room also contains the library of department books, a set of research materials kept on hand so that people don't have to go over to the university library to double-check basic data during a discussion."

Southwest of the seminar door is Language Studies Seminar Room. The description of the Language Studies Seminar Room is "They recently redid this room, and whoever picked the decorations had postmodern tastes." The Language Studies Seminar Room is indoors and southern.

Carry out going to the Language Studies Seminar Room:
	record "gaining access to the synthesizer" as achieved.

The LSR bookcase is a supporter in the Language Studies Seminar Room. The initial appearance is "The bookshelves lining the walls contain the department library." The description is "Built in and sturdily made." The printed name is "bookshelf". Understand "shelf" or "shelves" or "bookshelf" as the LSR bookcase.

The big table is a supporter in the Language Studies Seminar Room.  "The [big table] at the cen[ter] of the room is an irregular polygon[if exactly one not handled chair is in location], with one [random not handled chair in location] pushed up to the shortest side[end if]."
	The introduction is "I think the shape is intended to undermine traditional conceptions of academic hierarchy, but in practice it  just means that whoever gets to seminar late has to sit with a table angle jabbing him in the stomach."
	The description is "Crafted from some exotic wood with lots of interesting burl structure. There was a wealthy donor behind the construction of this room."
	Understand "polygon" as the big table.

History of the Standards Revolution is a book on the LSR bookcase. The description of History of the Standards Revolution is "It covers in minute detail the process by which the island standard[ize]d spelling and leveraged its linguistic power." The introduction is "[History] is of those bog-standard texts that everyone in my field owns a copy of and uses as a doorstop. Very occasionally something still arises that I need to look up, but I just about memor[ize]d it in preparation for my comprehensive exams."

Lives of the Lexicographers is a book on the LSR bookcase. The description of Lives of the Lexicographers is "It is a substantial history of the major contributors to the art of dictionary-creation, and a useful guide to the specialist bibliography on each figure."

Section 4 - Department Office

The Language Studies Department Office is southeast of Samuel Johnson Hall.
	The description is "This big, slightly drab area holds such useful objects as the [mailboxes] and the [secretary's computer]. On ordinary days the secretary would be in as well, presiding over affairs. The offices of individual professors lie [north] and [west][if Higgate's office door is closed and office-door-1 is closed], though both doors are closed[otherwise if Higgate's office door is closed], though the west door is closed[otherwise if office-door-1 is closed], though the north door is closed[end if]."
	The introduction is "This corner office was won in a battle of wills with several other departments during the most recent rebuilding drive. Professor Waterstone is fond of reminding the others that he was the one to obtain this fav[our]able position whenever there is a disagreement about procedure."

Rule for listing exits when looking in the Language Studies Department Office:
	do nothing instead.

The Language Studies Department Office contains some mailboxes and a u-shaped desk. The u-shaped desk is a desk. On the u-shaped desk is a desktop computer called the secretary's computer.

Instead of waving the letter-remover at the u-shaped desk when the current setting of the letter-remover is "u":
	say "It's not going to make a nothing-shaped desk. What would that even be? Shapeless?"

The language studies department office is indoors and southern.

The description of the u-shaped desk is "Formidable in size, but even that is not enough to support all of the things that the secretarial staff need to keep track of."

Does the player mean doing something with the secretary's computer:
	it is very likely.

The description of the secretary's computer is "One of many beige boxes hooked into the university's main system." The secretary's computer is scenery.

The secretary's computer runs a password-lock program called secretary's security.
	The password of secretary's security is "brownishott".

The secretary's computer runs a search engine called a browser.
	The data table of the browser is Table of Searchable Information.
	The description of the browser is usually "A browser comes up, with a search box for accessing departmental information."

Table of Searchable Information
topic	title	data
"waterstone/professor" or "professor waterstone"	"Waterstone's homepage"	"Professor Waterstone's webpage contains his CV (long) and a list of his future speaking engagements, including one set for tomorrow on homonym shame."
"higgate/professor" or "professor higgate"	"Higgate's homepage"	"Professor Higgate's homepage is illustrated by a picture of herself smiling enigmatically out in the university oval, followed by links for various courses she teaches, such as Interlingua and Advanced Klingon Certification. There is also a long bit praising the value of learning constructed languages, and a scanned copy of her Bureau stamp of certification to use and teach non-English tongues."
"brown/professor" or "professor brown"	"Brown's homepage"	"Professor Brown's homepage describes an assortment of personal interests I very much doubt he has time to pursue (such as salsa dancing) before delving into an impenetrable description of his research aims and goals."
"professor/downdweller" or "professor downdweller"	"Downdweller's homepage"	"Professor Downdweller's homepage is illustrated extensively with pictures of himself engaged in cheery undergraduate games such as three-legged races and squid fry-ups at the shore."
"professor/spout" or "professor spout"	"Spout's homepage"	"Professor Spout's homepage is just a stub supplied by the university tech services department. It appears that Spout has never seen a value in populating it, so it still contains the university crest and not much else."
"academic/calendar" or "academic calendar"	"academic calendar"	"The calendar lists upcoming events for the rest of the term, dates and times of finals, and similar information that I will never need again."
"student/students/roster/rosters/class/classes/courses"	"rosters"	"The secretary has access to all the rosters of all students enrolled in any department class, together with add/drop history. This reveals that Professor Brown's large Abstractions 101 course has bled steadily and is now at about half its original enrollment, while Higgate is able to command a small but loyal stream of people taking Advanced Klingon Certification as an independent study."
"Interlingua"	"Interlingua"	"It appears that the upcoming Interlingua course is going to be very healthily enrolled."
"Abstractions 101" or "abstractions" or "abstractions class"	"Abstractions 101"	"The syllabus for Abstractions 101 always assigns 250 pages of prolegomena in Week One. A review of previous versions of the syllabus shows that this has been the case for the last several years, and that the only thing that changes each year is the length of the Instructor's Note, offering a tetchy explanation of why students lacking this background will be ill-equipped to make the most of the course."
"Advanced Klingon Certification" or "klingon/certification" or "advanced klingon"	"Advanced Klingon Certification"	"Little information is available here, since Higgate uses few conventional books and relies heavily on handouts and exercises of her own devising, necessarily distributed under seal only to those students who have legal authority to enroll in the course."
"faculty/list/staff/teaching/teachers/teacher" or "faculty/staff/teacher/teachers list"	"faculty list"	"The faculty list for the department mentions professors Higgate, Waterstone, and Brown, as well as Professor Lamplighter (Emeritus), Professor Spout (has been a dean for three years and hasn't taught during that time), and Professor Downdweller (crosslisted with Economics, has offices in that department).

Many courses are taught by graduate students, but these are naturally not listed on the faculty page."
"research/overview" or "research overview" 	"research overview"	"The overview page merely mentions that cutting edge research is being carried forth by professors Brown, Higgate, and Waterstone, and invites the reader to visit their personal pages (naturally not linked)."
"graduate students/student"	"graduate student roster"	"This brings up a scrolling list of graduate students together with enrollment status, but does not actually reveal their grades or transcripts."


[Instead of switching on the secretary's computer:
	say "We'd need the secretarial password to log in, and I don't know it. And Waterstone is a tyrant about not letting people write passwords down [--] he has actually sincerely fired an admin worker for doing so in the past [--] so don't even think it." ]

Instead of taking the secretary's computer:
	say "I understand that theft is more or less your way of life, but please hold back this once."

Before writing a paragraph about something when the u-shaped desk is in the location:
	now the u-shaped desk is mentioned. [We want "the u-shaped desk" not "a u-shaped desk" or worse "an u-shaped desk".]

The department printer is a device on the u-shaped desk. It is fixed in place. The description is "The networked [printer] handles output for all the computers in the department. [printer indicator]."
	Understand "lights" or "indicator" as the department printer.
	The printed name is "printer".
	The department printer is switched on.
	The introduction is "The use of just one printer sometimes leads to annoying clashes when one person is printing off, say, the draft of a small monograph when someone else wants to make up quizzes for class. But Waterstone insists that it's not worth spending department money on another printer when those funds could go to faculty development grants."

Instead of taking the department printer:
	say "It would be a heavy thing to carry around, and I don't see much use for it elsewhere."

Rule for writing a paragraph about the department printer:
	say "[The department printer] also sits on [the u-shaped desk]. [run paragraph on]";
	now the output tray is referenced by the current-paragraph;
	now the paper-drawer is referenced by the current-paragraph;
	if the paper-drawer is open:
		say "[The paper-drawer] stands open[if the paper-drawer is not surprising]. [end if][run paragraph on]";
	while a surprising thing (called second special-target) is referenced by the current-paragraph:
		carry out the disclosing contents activity with the second special-target;
		now every thing contained by the second special-target is mentioned;
		now every thing supported by the second special-target is mentioned;
		now every thing held by the second special-target is mentioned;
		now every thing which is part of the second special-target is mentioned;
		now held-break is true;
	if held-break is true:
		say "[run paragraph on]";
	otherwise:
		say line break.


Rule for disclosing contents of the paper-drawer:
	now the current-subject is paper-drawer;
	say ", revealing [a list of mentionable things *in the paper-drawer]. [run paragraph on]".

After examining the department printer:
	if the paper-drawer is closed:
		say "The paper drawer is closed.";
	otherwise:
		try searching the paper-drawer;
	try searching the output tray.

Before printing the name of the paper-drawer while searching the paper-drawer:
	say "open "

Instead of putting something on the department printer:
	try putting the noun on the output tray.

Instead of inserting something into the department printer:
	try inserting the noun into the paper-drawer.

Instead of closing the department printer:
	try closing the paper-drawer.

Instead of opening the department printer:
	try opening the paper-drawer.

[Procedural rule while examining the department printer:
	ignore the examine described devices rule. ]

A printer mode is a kind of value. The printer modes are not-on, standby, ready, and out of paper.

A paper-drawer is part of the department printer. The paper-drawer is a container. It is closed and openable and privately-named. The printed name is "paper drawer". Understand "paper-drawer" or "paper drawer" or "drawer" or "clamps" or "clamp" or "plastic clamps" as the paper-drawer. The description is "The paper-drawer slides neatly in (or out) of the body of the printer, and is deep enough to hold a multi-inch stack of fresh paper. A small catch secures it from being carelessly opened[if the paper-drawer is open and the paper-drawer is empty]. Some plastic clamps hold the pages in place inside, when there are any[end if]." Understand "catch" as the paper-drawer.

Instead of pushing or pulling the paper-drawer:
	if the paper-drawer is open:
		try closing the paper-drawer;
	otherwise:
		try opening the paper-drawer.

An output tray is part of the department printer. It is a supporter. The description of the output tray is "In molded plastic, it is an integral part of the printer body[if the output tray is non-empty]. Currently there [is-are a list of things *in the output tray] on the tray, waiting for the owner to come collect[end if]."

Report inserting the ream into the paper-drawer:
	say "The ream fits exactly into the depth of the drawer. [We] adjust the plastic clamps that hold pages in place until everything is snug." instead.

Report closing the paper-drawer:
	say "The paper-drawer slides back into place with a click." instead.

Report opening the paper-drawer:
	say "[We] pull up on the little catch and draw the drawer out[if the paper-drawer is non-empty], revealing [a list of things *in the paper-drawer][otherwise]. It's empty[end if]." instead.

Instead of putting something on the output tray:
	say "It's probably a bad idea to risk jamming the output tray by putting random things onto it."

Instead of putting something fluid on the output tray:
	say "Now that's just vandalism."

Test paper-bug with "tutorial off / shutoffice / wave c-remover at cream / open paper-drawer / put ream in drawer / close drawer / z / open drawer / x paper" holding the cream in the Department office.

A draft document is a thing. Understand "pages" or "speech" or "talk" or "asterisks" as the draft document. [Understand "paper" as the draft document when the paper is not visible.] The description is "It's fifteen pages double-spaced, and appears to be the draft of a talk Professor Waterstone is preparing to give at a convention. I immediately notice, however, that several portions of the speech are marked with angry triple asterisks [--] Waterstone's way of marking up parts of text that need serious revision.

The talk concerns 'homonym shame': the anxiety felt in the Victorian era, and still manifested at times in modern culture, about objects that shared the same name as (and therefore theoretically might be converted into) something rude. Methods of disguising the legs of pianos and crotches of trees occupy a good portion of Waterstone's exposition, and there is a page-long aside on methods of  making sure that donkeys are known by that name and not by the alternative.

To judge, however, from the angry asterisking, Waterstone is still looking for at least one more example of an object susceptible to double-entendre that has been successfully rendered innocent by some linguistic modification."

The draft document can be pending. The draft document is not pending.

Every turn when the draft document is pending and the current printer mode is ready:
	move the draft document to the output tray;
	now the draft document is not pending;
	move the single ream to the repository;
	move the blank-paper to the paper-drawer;
	say "The printer whirs as though clearing its throat, and then begins to spit pages rapidly into the output tray."

To say printer indicator:
	if the current printer mode is:
		-- not-on:
			say "All the indicator lights are dark";
		-- standby:
			say "The indicator lights glow amber for standby mode";
		-- out of paper:
			say "The indicator lights glow red to indicate that the paper-drawer is empty";
		-- ready:
			say "The indicator lights glow green with readiness";
	if the draft document is pending and current printer mode is not not-on:
		say ". An additional light indicates that some document is in the queue to print and is waiting for the printer to [if the current printer mode is not ready]be ready[otherwise]start, which should happen any minute[end if]"

To decide what printer mode is the current printer mode:
	if the department printer is switched off:
		decide on not-on;
	if the paper-drawer is open:
		decide on standby;
	if the paper-drawer is empty:
		decide on out of paper;
	decide on ready.

Report switching on the printer:
	say "[We] switch the printer on. The lights all come on and flash a few times while it warms itself up. Then things settle down. [printer indicator]." instead.

Sanity-check writing the topic understood on the blank-paper:
	say "Writing on the paper would ruin it for the printer." instead.

A blank-paper is a thing. The printed name is "blank paper". Understand "blank paper" or "blank" or "paper" as the blank-paper. The indefinite article is "some". The description is "Having lost a few pages, there is no longer a ream, but there's still enough here to keep the printer going for a while." Understand "pages" as the blank-paper.

Instead of taking the blank-paper:
	say "Might as well leave it there for future users."

Check inserting something into the paper-drawer:
	if the noun is the ream:
		continue the action;
	if the noun is the blank-paper:
		continue the action;
	otherwise:
		say "Only fresh printer paper can safely go into the paper-drawer, and it must be the right size and in quantities of no more than a ream." instead.

The mailboxes are a scenery container.
	Understand "mailbox" as the mailboxes.
	Instead of searching the mailboxes, say "No need: it will be the usual assortment of advertisements from academic presses, copies of the campus newspaper (which are never interesting and always get discarded), memos from the dean with no informational content whatsoever, and so on."

The description of the mailboxes is "There are slots for all the professors and graduate students. Undergraduates, of course, are too insignificant to be assigned mailboxes, and are not allowed to have mail delivered to the department."

Section 5 - Higgate's Office

Higgate's office is an office. It is privately-controlled and southern.

	try Higgate opening the seminar door;
	try Higgate approaching the Seminar Room;

Instead of doing something in the presence of Higgate when the noun is the synthesizer or the second noun is the synthesizer or the noun is the plexiglas case or the noun is the screws or the second noun is the plexiglas case or the second noun is the screws:
	say "Higgate may be a little unworldly, but there is no way she'd let us mess with the synthesizer without interference. We'll have to hope she is willing to leave us in here."

Instead of going somewhere when the location is the Seminar Room and Higgate is in the location:
	say "[We] got in here on the pretext of putting the book away. It would be odd to leave again without doing so."

After putting the Problem of Adjectives on the LSR Bookcase:
	say "[We] take a moment to find the proper place for the book.

The sound of discussion comes from down the hall: two voices speaking in Lojban, and then a male voice interrupting. 'Do you have a lic[ense] for this conversation?' it asks.

'Excuse me,' Higgate says. 'I'd better go see to that.'";
	try Higgate approaching higgate's office;
	reset the interlocutor;
	now higgate's office door is closed instead.

Instead of examining Higgate's office door when Higgate-arrested has happened:

	otherwise:
		clear the path-walked for the player;
	if higgate-arrested has happened:
		say "The door is sealed with Bureau tape. Evidently they are planning to search more carefully later." instead;
	say "[one of][We] open the door to find two students, a boy and a girl, sitting at Higgate's table. The boy is sipping tea and the girl is paging madly through the Lojban book. 'Oh,' says Higgate. 'You found what you needed, I hope? I'm afraid [we] [are] busy now.'

So I duck us back out and close the door[or]I don't think [we] need anything else, and it would be mean to interrupt their tea again[stopping].".

Instead of listening to Higgate's office door when Higgate's office door is closed:
	if higgate-arrested has happened:
		say "Dead silence." instead;
	say "Putting our ear to the door, [we] hear [one of]a girl's voice stumbling over a question[or]Professor Higgate saying something rapid and fluent[or]a boy laughing[stopping]."

Higgate's Office is west of Higgate's office door. The description is "Higgate got about 30% finished with a stylish decorating scheme and then got distracted, leaving everything in a unsettled state. A few of her books are arranged on a very nice [rosewood bookshelf], which looks Asian[if the small figurines are on the bookshelf] and is ornamented with [small figurines][end if]; all the rest of her library is stacked higgledy-piggledy in [plastic cartons]."

The rosewood bookshelf is a supporter in Higgate's Office. It is scenery. Some small figurines are on the rosewood bookshelf. The small figurines are scenery. The description of the small figurines is "They depict mostly characters from popular children's fiction: Professor Higgate has a particularly strong and inexplicable fetish for the Wizard of Oz."

Some plastic cartons are containers in Higgate's Office. They are scenery. The description of the plastic cartons is "Traffic-cone orange and very unattractive."

[Some trim is scenery in Higgate's office. The description is "The trim [--] no more than a line around the top of the walls, really [--] is a handsome dark green that sets off the rosewood."]

The paint can be released or retained. The paint is retained.

Instead of taking the paint when the paint is retained:
	say "Higgate looks like a sweetheart, and in many respects she is, but if we start stealing her stuff right in front of her there's a very good risk she'll call security."

Instead of waving the letter-remover at the paint when the paint is retained:
	say "Higgate might mind our modifying her stuff without permission." ]

When play begins (this is the setting up Higgate's office rule):
	let N be a random chair in Higgate's Office;
	move Professor Higgate to N.

Rule for writing a topic sentence about Professor Higgate when Higgate is on a chair (called the special-target):

Rule for writing a topic sentence about Professor Higgate when Higgate is in the Seminar Room:
	say "[Professor Higgate] waits a little absent-mindedly nearby, looking over [the LSR Bookcase]. [run paragraph on]".

Rule for disclosing exterior of Professor Higgate when Professor Higgate is on a chair:
	do nothing instead.

Professor Higgate is an alert woman in Higgate's Office.
	The description is "Professor Higgate is about forty-five, very tall and slim, with a short, no-nonsense hairstyle. Indeed everything about her self-presentation suggests that she has studied how to make herself acceptably professional in the shortest possible time each day, and now adheres to this plan with absolute rigor.

What she might look like in some other setting, such as on a date or at a formal dinner, is beyond my ability to imagine."
	The introduction is "Higgate is the second reader on my dissertation committee, and a conlang expert [--] that is, Constructed Languages. It was a seminar with her that really got me thinking about utopian linguistics, and she's been very supportive, though cautious[if Professor Waterstone is introduced]. She and Professor Waterstone don't always get along that well[end if]."

The oval table is a privately-named supporter in Higgate's Office. It supports a book called Complete Lojban. Understand "table" or "oval table" as the oval table. [Disambiguate from University Oval in GO TO commands.]

	follow the water-reaction rules for the selected object.

The water-reaction rules are an object-based rulebook.

A Water-reaction rule for a Waterstone-inspiring thing (called the target):

	rule succeeds.

A Water-reaction rule for the cock-ring:

Held-over-object is a thing that varies.

Instead of showing something to special glass window when Professor Waterstone is enclosed by Waterstone's Office and office-door-1 is closed and the location is Language Studies Department Office:
	say "Though there is a window and Waterstone can watch the outer office from his desk, he is unable to hear you through the closed door, which is presumably the purpose of closing it. I will try knocking instead.";

	now held-over-object is the noun;
	try knocking on office-door-1.

A special glass window is part of office-door-1. The description of the special glass window is "It's nearly the width of the door, and fills most of the upper half of the frame."

After deciding the scope of player when the player is in Language Studies Department Office:
	place Waterstone's Office in scope.

A description-concealing rule when the location is the Language Studies Department Office:
	now everything which is enclosed by Waterstone's Office is not marked for listing.

Report Professor Waterstone closing office-door-1:
	say "The office door closes with measured firmness behind us." instead.

Report Professor Waterstone locking office-door-1 with something:
	say "Through the window in Waterstone's door, [we] can see him turning the lock. When he catches us watching he gives a tight, unfriendly smile and goes back to his desk." instead.

Instead of searching the special glass window when office-door-1 is closed:
	if the location is Waterstone's Office:
		say "It's amazing what a great view there is."; [this actually should never happen because we shouldn't wind up trapped with W.]
	otherwise:
		if Professor Waterstone is enclosed by Waterstone's Office:
			say "Though he can easily see us through the office door window, Professor Waterstone resolutely ignores our impolite staring. He's trying to get something done on his laptop, but keeps stopping to stare at the screen or, apparently, to curse at it.";
		otherwise:
			say "Waterstone's office looks oddly bare now that the man himself is gone."

Instead of searching the special glass window when office-door-1 is open:
	say "[We] get a view of the wall behind the door, which is not terribly exciting."

Waterstone's Office is north of office-door-1. It is an office. It is privately-controlled and southern.

The description of Waterstone's Office is "A very finicky, neatly arranged room, in which one never feels quite at home.".

Rule for writing a paragraph about a desk (called target) which is in Waterstone's office:
	say "There is an almost bare desk[if the target is non-empty], which at the moment supports [a list of things *in the target][end if]." Waterstone's Office is indoors.

[Waterstone is not based on any department chair I've worked for, nor on my own advisor (all of whom have been thoroughly nice people).]

Professor Waterstone is an alert man in Waterstone's Office.
	The description of Waterstone is "Waterstone is in many respects a brilliant man, but he also has a spectacular capacity for ticking people off. He has a dry, off-beat sense of hum[our] whose output is often indistinguishable from insult; he is also convinced that he knows best about most topics of policy, which brings him into frequent disagreement with his colleagues, the dean, and (we hear) his wife.".
	The introduction of Waterstone is "Waterstone is my dissertation advisor. (He insists on the 'o' spelling.) He's an expert in the history of linguistic and orthographical power, but he's politically kind of reactionary. 'Don't meddle' is pretty much his motto[if Professor Higgate is introduced]. He and Professor Higgate don't always get along that well[end if]."

od-key unlocks office-door-1. od-key is carried by Waterstone.

Rule for deciding the concealed possessions of Waterstone:
	if the particular possession is the od-key:
		yes.

Report Professor Waterstone saying hello to the player:
	if Waterstone does not recollect W-identifies, queue W-identifies;
	otherwise say "'Hello[one of] again[or][at random],' Waterstone says.";
	stop the action.

When play begins (this is the setting up Waterstone's office rule):
	let target be a random desk which is in Waterstone's Office;
	move the invitation to the target;
	move the small laptop to the target;
	let new target be a random chair which is in waterstone's office;
	move Professor Waterstone to the new target.

An invitation is a thing. The heft of the invitation is 1.
The description of the invitation is "It is a white card, like a wedding invitation, with swirly script lettering. 'You are invited,' it says, '[waterstone-invited]to a demonstration of a new T-inserter not available to the general public [--] Serial Comma Day [--] Bureau of Orthography.'

Smaller, meaner sans-serif lettering across the bottom adds: 'Bring this card for admission.'"
	The introduction is "It's from Dental Consonants Limited. Their design of stationery is unmistakable."
	Understand "lettering" or "invite" or "stationery" as the invitation.

Instead of taking the invitation when the location is Waterstone's Office:
	say "We reach out our hand. He watches us the way a bird of prey might watch the twitching of a small garden snake. Our hand retracts. We do not take the invitation."

Instead of examining something when the location of the noun is not the location and the heft of the noun is 1:
	say "It's hard to get a good look at [the noun] from this distance."

A small laptop is a laptop. The description is "It goes everywhere with Waterstone and is grimy with long use, but still functional." It is open and switched on.

Instead of taking the small laptop:
	say "We reach out our hand. He watches us the way a bird of prey might watch the twitching of a small garden snake. Our hand retracts. We do not take Professor Waterstone's laptop."

Section 7 - Samuel Johnson Basement


Below Samuel Johnson Hall is Samuel Johnson Basement. The description of Samuel Johnson Basement is "Dank and malod[our]ous: there are no windows down here, and the drainage is terrible.

The stairs [up] are here; the lecture room at the [east]. Immediately [south] is the Graduate Student Office, and [southwest] is Professor Brown's office. The most interesting of all is the small door west, trying to look inconspicuous, but locked with a keycard lock: it's where the department stores its most dangerous licensed equipment[if the small door is open]. At the moment it stands invitingly open[end if]."

Rule for listing exits while looking in Samuel Johnson Basement:
	do nothing instead.

Instead of smelling Samuel Johnson Basement, say "The distinctive scent of mildew, no doubt a result of the endless flooding and re-flooding of this corridor." Samuel Johnson Basement is indoors and southern.


The small door is west of Samuel Johnson Basement. The small door is a door. It is closed and locked. It is scenery. The description of the small door is "It has no label, only a keycard-reading lock.".

Report unlocking the small door with something:
	say "[We] unlock the small door with a swipe of [the second noun]." instead.

The keycard-reading lock is a container. It is part of the small door. The description is "It looks high-tech: all black plastic, and a slot to swipe a keycard through." Understand "slot" or "keycard lock" as the keycard-reading lock.

Instead of inserting something into the keycard-reading lock:
	say "[The noun] won't fit."

Instead of inserting the keycard into the keycard-reading lock:
	try unlocking the small door with the keycard.

Instead of inserting the card into the keycard-reading lock:
	try unlocking the small door with the noun.

Instead of inserting the passcard into the keycard-reading lock:
	try unlocking the small door with the noun.

Instead of inserting the pass into the keycard-reading lock:
	try unlocking the small door with the noun.

Understand "swipe [something]" as taking.
Understand "swipe [keycard]" as swiping. Swiping is an action applying to one thing.

Check swiping:
	if the the keycard-reading lock is marked invisible:
		say "There's nothing here to read it with." instead.

Carry out swiping:
	try unlocking the small door with the keycard instead.

Understand "swipe [keycard] in/through [something]" as inserting it into.

Instead of unlocking the small door with the card:
	say "It slides through the lock, but of course it doesn't have a magnetic unlocking stripe, so this does no good. [We] need more of a keycard."

Instead of unlocking the small door with the passcard:
	say "It slides through the lock, but since the information it encodes is passport information, not a key code, the door does not open."

Instead of unlocking the small door with the pass:
	say "This is the sort of pass that you show to people in order to gain access to places. What [we] need is more of a hard plastic keycard."

[Originally a "large box", but the risk of having it become a large ox was too great -- it would be easy to implement the transformation but hard to make it fair to the player if the box were to move from its appointed position.]

A large carton is a container in Samuel Johnson Basement. It is fixed in place. Understand "recycling" as the large carton. The initial appearance is "A large open carton stands against the wall right between Brown's lab door and [if the rectification room is visited]the Rectification Room[otherwise]the interesting door[end if][if the carton-sign is part of the carton]. 'Recycling,' reads the sign over the carton. 'Place your lab-created items here for processing.'[otherwise].[end if]".

The carton-sign is a sign. The carton-sign is part of the carton. The printed name is "sign". Understand "sign" as the carton-sign. The description is "'Recycling. Place your lab-created items here for processing.'"

In the large carton is a banana. The banana is edible. It is a vegetable. The description of the banana is "Just beginning to get brown and spotty."

Instead of going to the Rectification Room when the large carton does not contain something noisy:
	let N be the number of entries in the path so far of the player;
	if N is greater than 1:
		say "[path-walked so far]";
	otherwise:
		clear the path-walked for the player;
	say "[one of]Before [we] go through the door to the Rectification Room, it occurs to us that Professor Brown is just next door, and that he is likely to be able to hear if [we] do anything in there. Possibly some kind of masking noise is in order[or][if the player carries something noisy (called the mask)][The mask] [do] make noise, but you figure we should leave it out here in the hallway so that it will be louder than whatever we do in the room[otherwise]I defer to your judgment that [we] ought to provide some masking sound before proceeding[end if][stopping].".

Instead of dropping something in Samuel Johnson Basement when the heft of the noun is less than 4:
	say "I'll just leave [regarding the noun][those] in the carton; less likely to be disturbed there.";
	try inserting the noun into the large carton;

After dropping something noisy in the large carton:
	say "[We] set [the noun] in the carton, where [they] ought to provide a helpful distraction for the time being."

Understand "recycle [something]" as recycling. Recycling is an action applying to one carried thing.
Sanity-check recycling a person:
	say "[The noun] might not take kindly to that." instead.
Check recycling something when the large carton is marked invisible:
	say "There's no place to recycle [the noun]." instead.
Carry out recycling something:
	try inserting the noun into the large carton instead.

Section 8 - Rectification Room

The Rectification Room is west of the small door. It is indoors and southern. The description is "This is where equipment is brought for a tune-up, or to have its legal limits reinstalled (or, on rare occasions, removed). Access to these abilities is tightly controlled by the Bureau."

Instead of switching on the reclamation machine:
	try switching on the reclamation computer.

Instead of switching off the reclamation machine:
	try switching off the reclamation computer.

The reclamation machine is a closed openable fixed in place container in the Rectification Room.
	The introduction is "It's very ordinary looking, a simple machine with leads able to attach to various linguistic equipment, and to read and rewrite the programming."
	The initial appearance is "[The reclamation machine] stands near the door, ready to improve forbidden objects for the use of registered departmental users."
	The description is "You put a piece of linguistic equipment into the reclamation machine and the machine reprograms it. Attached to the machine is a computer which manages its behavi[our][if the reclamation machine is closed]. Currently the machine is closed: I assume [we] use the computer to open it for service[end if]."

Instead of opening the reclamation machine:
	say "The opening is controlled by the computer portion of the machine. It can't just be forced open."

The reclamation computer is a computer. It is part of the reclamation machine. One trackpad is part of the reclamation computer.

The reclamation computer is running a password-lock program called reclamation security.
	The password of reclamation security is "4tsaj39nbtz".

The reclamation computer is running an enumerated multiple-choice program called the reclamations operation program.
	The options table of the reclamations operation program is the table of deeds.
	The description of the reclamations operation program  is "At the top of the screen is the message STATUS: [if the reclamation machine is closed and the reclamation machine is limit-replacing]STANDBY[otherwise if reclamation machine is abstract-removing]REMOVING ABSTRACTION LIMITS[otherwise if reclamation machine is abstract-replacing]RESTORING ABSTRACTION LIMITS[otherwise if the reclamation machine is limit-replacing]RESTORING LEGAL LIMITS ON ANIMAL-CREATION[otherwise]REMOVING LEGAL LIMITS ON ANIMAL-CREATION[end if].

[options-list of the item described]".

The reclamation machine can be limit-removing, limit-replacing, abstract-removing or abstract-replacing.

Test password-bug with "switch on reclamation computer / examine password" in the Rectification Room holding the password-thing.

	say "That would be pointless, and even if it weren't, [the noun] won't fit into the reclamation machine."

Instead of inserting something which is not the letter-remover into the reclamation machine:
	say "The reclamation machine wouldn't be able to make much of [the noun], and there's always the risk of attracting undesired attention."

	say line break.

Instead of putting something on the tiny refrigerator:
	try putting the noun on the fridge-top.

The description of the coffee-maker is "It's the cheapest possible variety, donated by one of the older students, and it is constantly overflowing and needing to be taken away to be cleaned of loose grounds. But it does work, more or less, most of the time."

[In an earlier version of the game, there's an NPC hanging around the department who no longer appears: a grad student with a long-running crush on Alex, which he's never quite reciprocated. He's not that into her, and anyway, he keeps figuring he's going to leave the island and doesn't want to get into a relationship.

That element didn't tie into any puzzles and so felt kind of purposeless and unbalanced (and even from a story perspective, she had no special reason to be in the department on a holiday, and Alexandra had no reason to be talking to her when there's this important getting away to do).

So I cut the character, leaving only this covert element, a message of solidarity and warning that she's left behind.]

The sticky is a thing on the swivel-chair. The description is "[i]Please be careful. The blue hats are watching you.[/i]". Understand "writing" or "message" or "handwriting" or "note" or "warning" as the sticky.
	The introduction is "I half recogn[ize] the handwriting, but I'm having trouble placing it. One of the other grad students, but I'm not sure which."

Instead of putting the sticky on something which is not a supporter:
	say "[The sticky] doesn't have enough gumminess left to stick to anything new."

The water cooler is fixed in place in the Graduate Student Office. The description is "Perpetually empty because no one down here can be bothered to go up to the office, demand a refill, and lug the replacement bottle down the stairs."

Instead of drinking the water cooler:
	say "The water cooler does not contain any water at the moment."

Section 10 - Brown's Lab

Southwest of Samuel Johnson Basement is Brown's Lab. Brown's Lab is indoors and southern.

Sanity-check going to Brown's Lab when Higgate-arrested has happened:
	say "The whole area is likely under inspection after Brown's little Judas act back there. Who knew he had it in him? Is he seriously expecting to get her position?" instead.

Sanity-check approaching Brown's Lab when Higgate-arrested has happened:
	say "The whole area is likely under inspection after Brown's little Judas act back there. Who knew he had it in him? Is he seriously expecting to get her position?" instead.

The work table is scenery in Brown's Lab. The description is "It is a high green-covered counter, like those found in a physics laboratory."

On the work table is an electrical equipment. The electrical equipment is fixed in place. The indefinite article of the electrical equipment is "some". The flexible appearance of the electrical equipment is "A mare's nest of electrical equipment occupies most of the top of [the work table]." Understand "mare's" or "nest" or "metal" or "digital" or "readouts" or "boxes" or "wires" or "readout" or "box" or "wire" or "series" or "series of" as the electrical equipment.

The description of the electrical equipment is "A series of metal boxes with digital readouts and wires that lead in and out."

The introduction of the electrical equipment is "Brown uses this stuff to measure the amount of energy it requires to reify abstract concepts such as 'talk'. He has a theory, apparently, that by measuring the minute variations of input energy required to create these items, he can establish baseline indications about how much certain words are used by English-speakers worldwide; ten, fifty, or a hundred years from now, this data will allow researchers to determine whether these same words have become more or less popular relative to other words.

It's a little weird. Abstract reifications are one of the absolute coolest things in language studies[if higgate is as-yet-unknown],[otherwise] [--] Professor Higgate calls them the dark matter of language [--][end if] but Brown has managed to pick the very most boring research project to perform on them, and one which moreover is guaranteed to prevent him having any results worth publishing any time in the next two decades.

This pretty much sums up everything you need to know about the guy."

Professor Brown is an alert man in Brown's Lab. The initial appearance is "[Professor Brown], the Reification of Abstracts researcher, is [if Brown is in Brown's Lab]hunched over his work table[else]standing around awkwardly[end if]."

The introduction is "Brown is only barely a professor at all [--] actually, his working title is Senior Lecturer, and he holds a yearly contract which the University has the option to renew at whim. This prevents him going elsewhere while ensuring that he never has a fully-funded lab of his own. All [the electrical equipment] down here is tinker-toys compared to the stuff he really wants; in fact, half of it he built himself with components he bought with his own money.

I know all this because Brown cornered me in the hallway one afternoon and talked to me for twenty minutes straight about the pressures of academic job-hunting in the current political climate. I tried to get him to stop, but he's like a wind-up toy."

The description of Professor Brown is "He's going bald on top [--] prematurely, because I think he's only 28 or so [--] so, to compensate, he's grown a goofy little [goatee]."


Check waving the letter-remover at goatee when the current setting of the letter-remover is "e":
	if letter-remover is creature-enabled:
		say "Oh so tempting. You're not the first person to think of it, trust me. The undergrads have a whole sideline in Professor Brown caricature where he has a goat coming out of his face. But if we succeeded, we'd get arrested, and Brown could be seriously injured. I can't go along with that." instead;
	else:
		say "Brown's facial hair is currently saved by the fact that we couldn't generate a goat with this letter-remover." instead.

Test goatee with "wave e-remover at goatee / autoupgrade / wave e-remover at goatee" in Brown's Lab.

The goatee is part of Professor Brown. The description is "It fails to conceal Professor Brown's lack of personal charisma."

Report Professor Brown saying hello to the player:
	say "'Don't touch anything, please,' he says, without looking up." instead.

Professor Brown wears steel-rimmed spectacles and a worn leather jacket. The description of the steel-rimmed spectacles is "They have tiny oval lenses, tinted green."

The introduction of the steel-rimmed spectacles is "Brown seems to be simultaneously cultivating the image of rebel (age 17) and absent-minded professor (age 65)."

The description of the worn leather jacket is "A moderately cool sort of bomber-jacket look, except that the elbows have given out and the cuffs are unraveling."



Section 11 - Lecture Hall

Lecture Hall 1 is east of Samuel Johnson Basement. The description is "The main lecture hall used for large survey courses in language studies offered to undergraduates. I sat through courses here when I was an undergraduate myself, and have now delivered a few lectures as a teaching assistant." Lecture Hall 1 is indoors and southern.

Out-direction of Lecture Hall 1 is west. [Back to Samuel Johnson basement]

After deciding the scope of the player when the location is Lecture Hall 1:
	place the wooden seats in scope.

Rule for listing exits when looking in Lecture Hall 1: do nothing instead.

The printed name is "Lecture Hall (at the podium)". Understand "podium" or "at podium" or "at the podium" or "(at podium)" or "(at the podium)" as Lecture Hall 1.

The podium is a supporter in Lecture Hall 1. It is scenery. The description is "An advanced, pre-wired [podium] that allows the instructor to project slides from a laptop or show movies."

On the podium is a page. The page is a notepad. The description of the page is "A sheet of lined paper[if the location is Lecture Hall 1], presumably left by the person who lectured here last[end if]."
	The memo of the page is "visual[ization] training... preparation at a young age... cooperative direction of language outcomes".
	The page write-allows a pen and some pens. Understand "paper" as the page.

A description-concealing rule when the page is marked for listing:
	if the page is not seen and the page is not handled:
		now the page is not marked for listing.

A ranking rule for the page when the page is on the podium:
	increase the description-rank of the page by 40.

Rule for writing a topic sentence about the page when the page is on the podium:
	say "Some previous lecturer has left [a page] on [the podium]. [run paragraph on]"

Before local looking Lecture Hall 1:
	if the subcommand of the noun matches the text "podium":
		try examining the podium instead.

Test page with "tutorial off / look / x podium / look" in Lecture Hall 1.

The conference poster is a fixed in place thing in Lecture Hall 1. Understand "title" or "papyrus" or "font" or "daguerreotype" or "catchy" or "portly woman" or "speakers" or "pictures" or "inset" or "waterstone" as the conference poster.
	The initial appearance is "A poster at the front of the room announces a conference on cultural reactions to linguistic change. It is being held in Nice the day after tomorrow, with Professor Waterstone as keynote speaker, on the topic of 'homonym shame'."
	The introduction is "Somehow I had forgotten about the date of this: I've been too much worried about our escape."
	The description is "It's the usual sort of thing: the conference title set in Papyrus font; a stock daguerreotype of a portly woman holding a letter-remover the size of a policeman's cosh; inset pictures of the major speakers, with pride of place for Waterstone himself."

[After we've changed the poster once, it should stop being stuck in place.]
A dangerous destruction rule for the conference poster:
	now the conference poster is not fixed in place;
	now the initial appearance of the conference poster is "A conference poster lies curled on the ground.";
	now the description of the conference poster is "The poster announces a conference on cultural reactions to linguistic change. It is being held in Nice the day after tomorrow, with Professor Waterstone as keynote speaker, on the topic of 'homonym shame'. It's the usual sort of thing: the conference title set in Papyrus font; a stock daguerreotype of a portly woman holding a letter-remover the size of a policeman's cosh; inset pictures of the major speakers, with pride of place for Waterstone himself.".

Sanity-check looking under the conference poster when the conference poster is fixed in place:
	say "That would be hard to do without ripping it off the wall." instead.

Lecture Hall 2 is south of Lecture Hall 1. The printed name is "Lecture Hall (among the seats)". Understand "seats" or "among the seats" or "among seats" or "(among seats)" or "(among the seats)" as Lecture Hall 2. Lecture Hall 2 is indoors and southern.
	The description is "Many are the fine hours I have spent here dozing; and many are the students of mine who have done the same. The circle of life becomes complete."


Some wooden seats are supporters in Lecture Hall 2. Understand "hard" or "wood" as the wooden seats. The initial appearance is "The room extends [if Location is Lecture Hall 1]south[otherwise]north[end if], full of hard [wooden seats]." The description is "Ingeniously uncomfortable."

Rule for disclosing contents of the wooden seats when at least one mentionable thing is on the wooden seats:
	say "Abandoned on one near the back [is-are a list of mentionable things *in the wooden seats].[no line break]"

A coat is on the wooden seats. The coat is floppy and wearable. It covers the torso-area. The description is "It's been abandoned here for a while, since this isn't the time of year when people wear coats. It's brown cloth, only thick enough to keep out rain or a mild chill, and it's rubbed shiny at the elbows. No wonder the owner didn't miss it much." The heft of the coat is 2. Understand "brown coat" or "brown cloth" as the coat.

The scent-description of the coat is "dust and a faintest lingering trace of men's cologne".


The course advertisement is a fixed in place thing in Lecture Hall 2. Understand "ad" or "interlingua" as course advertisement.
	The initial appearance is "Someone has taped to the wall a [course advertisement] for next quarter, inviting interested undergraduates to enroll in Interlingua 101."

The description of the course advertisement is "In large type:

[b]Interlingua 101: Learn a Language You Already Know.[/b]

In smaller type beneath: [i]Interlingua se basa a parolas international, preponderentemente de origine latin, que ha supervivite a nostre dies, e que existe in italiano, espaniol/portugese, francese e anglese (linguas de referentia) plus germano e russo como reserva. Le grammatica del interlingua es un rationalisate synthese del grammaticas de referentia.[/i]

And then as a final tagline: INTERLINGUA IS THE MODERN LATIN.".
	The introduction is "Probably Professor Higgate's work."

Instead of taking the course advertisement, say "It has been stuck to the wall with so much tape that [we] probably couldn't remove it without tearing it."

[Before doing something in Lecture Hall 1 when the noun is on the seats or the second noun is on the seats:
	say "(first wending our way among the seats)[command clarification break]";
	try going south;
	if the location is Lecture Hall 1:
		stop the action.]

The Campus is a region. University Oval, [Grimy Staircase 1, Grimy Staircase 2,] Samuel Johnson Hall, Higgate's Office, Waterstone's Office, the Language Studies Department Office, Samuel Johnson Basement, Graduate Student Office, Lecture Hall 1, Lecture Hall 2, Brown's Lab, Rectification Room, and the Language Studies Seminar Room are in Campus.
