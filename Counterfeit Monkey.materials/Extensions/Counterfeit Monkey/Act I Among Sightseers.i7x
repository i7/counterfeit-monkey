Chapter 1 - Barriers and Spaces

[Because the temporary barrier is the first real puzzle the player faces, it is especially important to handle all attempts at interaction as clearly as possible. In addition, the point of the puzzle is to figure out how to get the code, not to make the player do fiddly things -- so anything that could reasonably be construed as an attempt to use the code once it's been discovered should be redirected towards opening.]

The temporary barrier is south of Fair. The temporary barrier is a door. It is transparent, closed and locked. The initial appearance is "[A temporary barrier] blocks [if the location is the Fair]this noisy fair from the empty street to the south[otherwise]this empty street from the busy fair to the north[end if][if the temporary barrier is locked], though there is a door that could be opened with the correct code[otherwise], though it is currently unlocked and anyone could go through[end if][if the location is Ampersand Bend]. From here the gaiety and excitement of the holiday are fairly loud[end if]."

The description of the temporary barrier is "It's a high metal fence, supported by sturdy poles. It's designed to contain the chaos a little, and keep people who have come in for the Fair from wandering off down the side streets and causing trouble in unpoliced areas of town. It has [a code-lock] that opens the inset door."

Instead of looking under the temporary barrier:
	say "[The temporary barrier] is set flush with the ground. There is certainly not enough room to crawl underneath."

Instead of climbing the temporary barrier:
	say "The links of the fence are too close to offer easy purchase for feet, and the fence is high and barbed on top. They really don't want anyone coming through uninvited."

Instead of pulling or pushing or turning or attacking the temporary barrier:
	say "It rattles a little, but is basically far too sturdy for us to take down."

Instead of touching the temporary barrier:
	say "It's sturdy [--] though not electrified, if that's what you were thinking."

A description-concealing rule when the temporary barrier is marked for listing:
	if the location is the Fair and the temporary barrier is open, now the temporary barrier is not marked for listing.

Sanity-check unlocking the temporary barrier with something:
	if the code is marked-visible:
		try setting the code-lock to "code" instead;
	say "[The temporary barrier] is locked. [We][']d need to set the code-lock to the right number." instead.

Sanity-check unlocking keylessly the temporary barrier:
	if the code is marked-visible:
		try setting the code-lock to "code" instead;
	say "[The temporary barrier] is locked. [We][']d need to set the code-lock to the right number." instead.

Sanity-check locking the temporary barrier with something:
	if the code is marked-visible:
		try setting the code-lock to "333" instead;
	say "[We][']d need to set [the code-lock] to some random number." instead.

Sanity-check locking keylessly the temporary barrier:
	if the code is marked-visible:
		try setting the code-lock to "333" instead;
	say "[We][']d need to set [the code-lock] to some random number." instead.

Understand "door" as the temporary barrier.

Sanity-check locking keylessly the code-lock:
	try setting the code-lock to "333" instead.
Sanity-check locking the code-lock with something:
	try setting the code-lock to "333" instead.
Sanity-check closing the code-lock:
	try setting the code-lock to "333" instead.

Sanity-check unlocking keylessly the code-lock:
	try setting the code-lock to "code" instead.
Sanity-check unlocking the code-lock with something:
	try setting the code-lock to "code" instead.
Sanity-check opening the code-lock:
	try setting the code-lock to "code" instead.

A code-lock is part of temporary barrier. Understand "code lock" or "lock" as the code-lock. Understand "code" as the code-lock when the code is marked invisible. The description is "The kind of lock that can be set to a three-digit code, assuming one knows what the code is."

Before typing the topic understood on the code-lock:
	try setting the code-lock to the topic understood instead.

Before typing the topic understood on the temporary barrier:
	try setting the code-lock to the topic understood instead.

Setting action variables for setting the temporary barrier to:
	now the noun is code-lock.

Understand "use code" as code-entering. Understand "enter code" as code-entering. Understand "use code on [code-lock]" as code-entering on. Understand "enter code in/on [code-lock]" as code-entering on. Understand "enter code in/on [temporary barrier]" as code-entering on.

Code-entering is an action applying to nothing.

Check code-entering:
	unless the code-lock is marked-visible:
		say "There's nothing here on which to enter a code." instead.

Carry out code-entering:
	try setting the code-lock to "code" instead.

Code-entering on is an action applying to one visible thing.

Instead of code-entering on the temporary barrier:
	try setting the code-lock to "code".

Carry out code-entering on the code-lock:
	try setting the code-lock to "code" instead.

Test code-lock with "tutorial off / n / e / use code / use code on lock / type code / type code on code-lock / type code on barrier / set lock to code / set barrier to code / enter code / enter code on lock / enter code on barrier / enter code in lock / wave x-remover at codex / use code / use code on lock / type code / type code on lock / type code on lock / set lock to code / set barrier to code / set lock to 305 / set barrier to 305 / enter code on lock / enter code in lock / enter code on barrier / enter code / enter code in barrier".

Instead of setting the code-lock to "305":
	if the temporary barrier is locked:
		say "We set the wheels of the code-lock to [the topic understood].[paragraph break]Click! The barrier door unlocks.";
		now the temporary barrier is unlocked;
		set pronouns from the temporary barrier;
	otherwise:
		say "[The temporary barrier] door was already unlocked.";
		set pronouns from the temporary barrier;

Understand "the right number/code" or "the number/code" or "number/code" or "right number/code" as "[code]".

Instead of setting the code-lock to "[code]":
	if the code is marked invisible:
		say "If only the code were written down somewhere nearby.";
	otherwise:
		try setting the code-lock to "305".

Instead of setting the code-lock to something:
	if the temporary barrier is unlocked:
		say "We set the wheels of [the code-lock] to [the topic understood].[paragraph break]Click! The barrier door locks.";
		now the temporary barrier is locked;
	otherwise:
		let N be "[the topic understood]";
		if N exactly matches the regular expression "\d*":
			say "The barrier door was already locked, but this just seems to have made it more certain of the fact.";
		otherwise:
			say "The code lock accepts only numbers."

Instead of listening to the code-lock:
	say "Even with our ear pressed to the code-lock, we're not able to distinguish any tell-tale clicks of the tumbler that would give away the correct combination."

Carry out going through the temporary barrier:
	record "passing through the temporary barrier" as achieved.

Ampersand Bend is south of the temporary barrier. It is a road. The description is "A bend in the street, which runs west and north. This district combines the old and the new: a small [museum] in an ancient stone building to the east, a shiny [real estate office] south. The window of the museum is currently displaying one of its exhibits, [a list of things *in the display stand][if the code is on the display stand]. Well, not to worry: they'll be able to restore the codex easily enough when the museum reopens[end if]." Understand "district" as Ampersand Bend.

Out-direction of Ampersand Bend is north. [Through the barrier]

Instead of listening to Ampersand Bend:
	say "The sounds from the north suggest a holiday fair in full swing: children laughing and shouting, people selling food and drinks, various fairground machinery, tinny music."

Instead of listening to the temporary barrier:
	try listening to Ampersand Bend.


Instead of smelling Ampersand Bend:
	say "Scents of distant popcorn and candy waft this way."

Instead of smelling the temporary barrier:
	try smelling Ampersand Bend.


The museum exterior is a facade in Ampersand Bend. It fronts east. It is scenery. Understand "old" or "medieval" or "city" or "wall" as the museum exterior. The printed name of the museum exterior is "museum".

The description is "One of several small museums around the older part of the island, celebrating the discovery of Atlantean language tools and the development of its modern society.

This particular museum is housed in a stone building. Parts of the old [if the player wears the Britishizing goggles]mediaeval[otherwise]medieval[end if] city wall are still visible in the foundations.

All that can be seen of the exhibits is the external [display window]. On the other side of the protective tinted glass [is-are a list of things *in the display stand]."

The display window is a transparent closed container. It is part of the museum exterior. The display stand is scenery. Understand "protective" or "tinted" or "glass" or "external" as the display window.

In the display window is a display stand. Instead of searching the display window: say "In the window is [a display stand], on which [is-are a list of things *in the display stand]."

Rule for reaching inside the display stand:
	say "The display window is, unsurprisingly, not open to reach into.";
	deny access.

On the display stand is a codex. The codex is scenery. The description of the codex is "A manuscript of Atlantean origin from the 16th century. It records a series of slightly mad visions of what the world would be like if the 'composition of letters' could be systematically exchanged.

At that time, the name-driven nature of the universe was not yet understood, but some consciousness of it wiggled towards the surface like a breaking tooth. The lunatics were first to notice.

I've visited this museum before and seen the inside, by the way. Many of the pages are filled with what [we] would now consider rather elementary rebus puzzles."

Instead of taking the codex:
	say "Even if [we] could reach, there's not much point in such a theft."

Instead of taking the code:
	say "Like the codex it replaced, [the code] is inside the museum display window. It doesn't much matter, though, as [we] can read the numbers."

The real estate office is a facade in Ampersand Bend. It fronts south. It is scenery. Understand "new" or "realty" or "real estate" or "estate agent" or "real" or "estate" or "office" or "window" or "advertisements" as the real estate office. The description is "Advertisements in the window describe the offerings around town, from a studio apartment (looks like a fixer-upper) in Deep Street for $823,000 to a house near the university for $2.5M. Prices for villas in the northwestern part of town are all listed just as 'Available on Inquiry.'[one of]

I can tell you find all that shockingly overpriced, but trust me: land is scarce on this island and there are a lot of people who want to own it, not just locals but international corporations.[or][stopping]".

Instead of going south in Ampersand Bend:
	say "That way lies a real estate office closed for Serial Comma Day. [run paragraph on]";
	carry out the listing exits activity.

Rule for listing exits while looking in Ampersand Bend:
	do nothing instead.

Sigil Street is west of Ampersand Bend. It is a road. The description is "The buildings here are two and three [if the player wears the Britishizing goggles]storeys[otherwise]stories[end if], with shops at ground level and [apartments] above. The shops are closed for the holiday: [a typographer's office], [clothing shops] of col[our]ful skirts and ethnic bodices (rarely if ever worn by natives) and t-shirts covered with font designs[if the reflective window is in Sigil Street].

[one of]Passing by [the reflective window] [we] catch the sight of our single blended body, and it creeps me out[or][The reflective window] of the closed shops reflect our synthes[ize]d self[stopping][end if]."

Some elderly apartments are scenery in Sigil Street. The description is "From down here [we] can only see the shuttered windows and the occasional balcony or awning, but you can guess what they're probably like from the environment: old-fashioned inside, kitchens and bathrooms awkwardly fitted into niches and closets of buildings that weren't designed for plumbing. But they're also probably rather [if the player wears the Britishizing goggles]cosy[otherwise]cozy[end if] and handsome, with exposed beams under the ceiling." Understand "flat" or "apartment" or "building" or "buildings" as the elderly apartments when location is Sigil Street.

Does the player mean finding the elderly apartments:
	it is very unlikely.

Does the player mean approaching My Apartment:
	it is very likely.

Check finding the elderly apartments:
	if the subcommand of the elderly apartments matches the text "apartment":
		try approaching My Apartment instead.

The reflective window is a fixed in place mirror in Sigil Street.
	Understand "shop window/windows" or "windows" as the reflective window.

Rule for listing exits while looking in Sigil Street:
	say "[An alleyway] runs between buildings to the south, while the street continues east." instead.

The alleyway is a scenery facade in sigil street. It fronts south. Understand "alley" or "narrow" as the alleyway. The printed name is "narrow alley". The description is "It looks forbidding and a bit unsanitary."

Instead of examining the reflective window:
	try searching the noun.

The clothing shops are a facade in Sigil Street. They are scenery. They are plural-named. The clothing shops front west. Understand "store" or "shops" or "stores" or "boutique" or "boutiques" or "tourist boutique" or "tourist Boutiques" as the clothing shops. The printed name is "tourist boutiques".
	The description is "[We] peruse the offerings: [list of things which are part of the clothing shops]."
	The introduction of the clothing shops is "I gather from your thoughts that you actually like some of the skirts, but I'd prefer that [we] skip the cross-dressing for now. Our synthes[ize]d body may be female but I'm still getting used to that."

Some colorful skirts are part of the clothing shops. They are floppy and wearable. The description is "Suitable for wearing while doing the local traditional dances, which are slightly Spanish." They cover the legs-area.

A mourning dress is part of the clothing shops. It is floppy and wearable. The description is a "A black vintage gown trimmed with much lace and dripping with jet beads." Understand "beads" or "jet" or "bead" or "black" or "vintage" or "gown" as the mourning dress. It covers the torso-area.

Check waving the letter-remover at font t-shirts when the current setting of the letter-remover is "r":
	say "No doubt this would be a cogent statement about the commercial[ization] of the body, if it weren't for the fact that T-SHIT doesn't describe anything anyone with a functional colon has ever heard of." instead.

Instead of taking something which is part of the clothing shops:
	say "Though [the noun] [are] theoretically for sale, there's no one in at the moment to sell [them] to us."

Instead of buying something which is part of the clothing shops:
	say "Though [the noun] [are] theoretically for sale, there's no one in at the moment to sell [them] to us."

The typographer's office is a facade in Sigil Street.  It is scenery.
	Understand "sign" or "display" or "poster" or "typographer" or "font" or "fonts" or "comma" or "commas" or "punctuation" as the typographer's office. It fronts north. The description of the typographer's office is "The office advertises custom fonts and symbols, though it is very unlikely that anyone decides to have a custom font made simply because they happened to catch a notice in a shop window. In hon[our] of the holiday, there is also a display poster showing the form of the humble comma as it manifests itself in a variety of popular fonts."

Instead of looking toward Back Alley:
	say "It doesn't look like there's anything interesting back that way."

Back Alley is south of Sigil Street. It is a road. The description is "[one of]This isn't much, is it? Just[or]There is nothing here but[stopping] the back sides of a couple of [yellow buildings], some peeling yellow paint[one of], and[or];[stopping] not even much by way of windows to look in through. [if unvisited]I think the place where [we] had the procedure done is just a block or two away, but I've already lost the door. I imagine they change it. [end if]

This alley runs north to the open street, towards the town square[if unvisited]. That's the way [we][']ll want to go first[end if]."
The dull house-back is a facade in Back Alley. It fronts south. It is scenery. The description is "The owners of the house obviously didn't want a view in this direction, as there aren't any windows to see through, just a wall scarred by decades of occasional remodeling."
	The closure notice is "There are no doors in [the item described]. ".

Some yellow buildings are a facade in Back Alley. They front east. They are scenery. Understand "windows" or "window" or "building" or "back" or "backs" or "sides" or "walls" as the yellow buildings when the location is Back Alley. The printed name is "[if looking]buildings[otherwise]yellow buildings[end if]". The description is "The buildings are no doubt due for renovation, but haven't received it yet.

Does the player mean finding the yellow buildings:
	it is very unlikely.

Some beige buildings are a facade in Back Alley. They front west. They are scenery. The description is "A little more beige than the buildings facing them, but just as shabby and free of windows."
	The closure notice is "There are no doors in [the item described]. ".

Check waving the letter-remover at yellow buildings when the current setting of the letter-remover is "s":
	say "The device warms up a bit in our hand, but fails. It doesn't have enough power to work on something as large as the yellow building." instead.

Check waving the letter-remover at beige buildings when the current setting of the letter-remover is "s":
	say "The device warms up a bit in our hand, but fails. It doesn't have enough power to work on something as large as the beige building." instead.

The yellow-paint is part of the yellow buildings. The description is "In this climate, of course, [paint] is quickly ruined by the sun." Understand "peeling" or "yellow paint" or "paint" as the yellow-paint. The indefinite article is "some". The printed name is "paint".

Instead of waving the letter-remover at the yellow-paint:
	say "A good thought [--] PAINT is a very linguistically productive word [--] but spread thin over a large area like this it's too hard for a low-powered letter-remover to work on."


[After going northeast from the Back Alley for the first time:
	let N be the number of entries in the path so far of the player;
	if N is greater than 1:
		say "[path-walked so far]";
	otherwise:
		clear the path-walked for the player;
	say "After the relative quiet and shelter, it's a bit shocking moving out into the open: suddenly there is sunlight, and crowds, and a wide open space, and seeing it all through your/our eyes instead of my own, I feel dizzy again.";
	continue the action. ]

Rule for listing exits while looking in the Back Alley:
	do nothing instead.

The player is in Back Alley. The player carries the letter-remover device.

Chapter 2 - Tutorial Content

Section 1 - Initial Waking

Rule for printing the banner text when stored first name is not "Andra":
	do nothing instead.

Before taking inventory for the first time:
	if  the player is carrying the letter-remover and the number of things carried by the player is 1:
		say "You insisted that we bring almost nothing into the synthesis room, so the criminal who was performing the synthesis couldn't rob us. I had hoped there was more hon[our] among thieves, but you said no, there isn't.";

A last when play begins rule (this is the initial conversation rule):
	say "Can you hear me? >> [run paragraph on]";
	if the player consents:
		say "[line break]Good, you're conscious. We're conscious. ";
	otherwise:
		say "[line break]Ah, smartaleck. But we're conscious. ";
	say "I've heard urban legends about synthesis going wrong, one half person getting lost.

Do you remember our name?[no line break]"

[The worst is over. The operation was a success: we are now one person, unrecognizable. If you're a little disoriented at the moment, that is no surprise. I feel a little sick myself.

Fortunately, we prepared for this eventuality. Before the change, that is. We should have everything we need to leave the country.

Me, I've been wandering around a bit aimlessly, waiting for you to come to. Here, I'll let you get your bearings...]

Identification is a scene. Identification begins when play begins. Identification ends when stored first name is "Andra".

Instead of looking during identification:
	do nothing.

Stored first name is some text that varies. Stored first name is usually "nothing".
New first name is some text that varies. New first name is usually "nothing".

After reading a command during identification:
	unless the player's command matches "restore":
		if stored first name is "nothing":
			now stored first name is the player's command;
			now stored first name is stored first name in sentence case;
			replace the regular expression "\p" in stored first name with "";

			otherwise if stored first name is "Alex":
				say "No, I'm Alex. Together we're Alexandra; before our synthesis, you were...";
			otherwise if stored first name is "Andra":

			otherwise:
				say "...oh boy. Okay. Okay. I need you on form here. This is going to be hard if you don't remember being Andra. Not panicking. ";
			say "As far as I can tell, the operation was a success. We're meant to be one person now, unrecognizable to anyone who knew us before.[paragraph break]";

Part 2 - Old Town Celebration

Chapter 1 - Central Park Area

Section 1 - The Park

Park Center is a room. The description of the Park Center is "This is a handsome expanse of [grass], shaped like a rectangle with rounds cut from the corners, bounded by [railings] along the north side. There are no stalls and no barkers here, but [small children] are running around [if the horses are part of the fountain]an impressive[else]a desecrated[end if] [marble fountain][if hoses are part of the marble fountain], currently spewing water in all directions[end if].[one of]

I gather from the direction of your thoughts that you dislike small children, so I'll restrain myself from trying to communicate with them.[or][stopping]".

Some railings are a facade. Understand "railing" as the railings. They are scenery in Park Center. They front north. The description is "Painted railings separate the Park and surrounding pedestrian areas from the private property to the north. Some [lipstick advertisements] have been hung over the railings." Understand "painted" as the railings.
	The closure notice is "There is no gate in the railings at this point. ".

Check waving the letter-remover at the railings when the current setting of the letter-remover is "s":
	say "The letter-remover warms in our hand, but nothing visibly changes, perhaps because RAILING lies on the awkward verge between a count noun and a mass noun, and if we say RAILINGS we mean something not very different from A QUANTITY OF RAILING, making RAILING a word with cumulative reference." instead


Some lipstick advertisements are part of the railings.
	Understand "ad" or "ads" or "advert" or "adverts" as the lipstick advertisements.
	The description of the lipstick advertisements is "Over the image of a pouting, lipsticked female, it says: IN EVERY TEMPTRESS THERE IS AN EMPRESS [--] MAKE YOURSELF UP TO A T! It's selling Temptress Brand cosmetics, apparently.".

Rule for listing exits when looking in Park Center:
	do nothing instead.

Rule for distantly describing Park Center:
	say "That way is the cen[ter] of the park, across a lot of grass."

[Before printing the name of a direction (called way) while listing exits:
	if the player is in Park Center, say "[room way from the location] to the "

Procedural rule when listing exits:
	if the location is Park Center, ignore the append room names rule.

Rule for listing exits when looking in Park Center:
	do nothing instead. ]


Check waving the letter-remover at the small children when the current setting of the letter-remover is "s":
	say "If it were a more powerful device, the letter-remover might be able to generate something resembling the concept of 'mall children,' but that's not an idiomatic saying around here. Not to mention that the parents would be bound to object." instead

Carry out examining small children:
	trigger Childhood-bedroom.

Some small children are a person in Park Center. Understand "child" or "boy" or "girl" or "sibling" as the small children. The description is "They look small and harmless, but you're probably right that they have sticky hands." The children are scenery.

Every turn when the location of the small children encloses the hoses and the location is Park Center:
	if a random chance of 1 in 2 succeeds:
		say "[one of]A little boy[or]A small girl[at random] [one of]tries to catch the spraying hosewater in an open mouth[or]pushes a sibling into the path of the water[or]leaps gleefully through the arc of water[at random].";
		now the description of the small children is "Most of them are now sopping wet, and loving it.";
		if a random chance of 1 in 5 succeeds:
			say "[line break]A harrassed-looking All-Purpose Officer comes hurrying across the lawn towards the vandal[ize]d fountain. For a moment it looks like she might get close enough to spot us, but about twenty paces off she stops, plants her feet, and gets out a restoration-gel rifle.

There's a bang, a last glittering fan of water in the air.[paragraph break]";
			gel-convert the hoses;
			say "As for the Officer, she's already speaking into her radio as she turns away.".

Every turn when the location of the small children encloses the ho and the location is Park Center:
	say "It isn't but a few seconds before a watchful parent notices the ho strutting around and goes to report her.

She is too stupid [--] as a constructed person [--] to put up much resistance when an officer shows up to escort her away.";
	now the ho is nowhere.

[[And now we need to special-case these, because otherwise they will fall on the ground. In general we want letter-conversion to move things that are part of other things, but here it's funnier and also more persuasive if the changed items stay part of the fountain.]
To gel-convert (item - hoses):
	now everything which proffers the item is part of the marble fountain;
	now the item is in the repository;
	[play the sound of gel splort;]
	say "[The item] [become] [a list of things which proffer the item], redecorating the fountain.";
	repeat with secondary running through things which proffer the item:
		abide by the dangerous construction rules for the secondary.
To gel-convert (item - hoe):
	now everything which proffers the item is part of the marble fountain;
	now the item is in the repository;
	[play the sound of gel splort;]
	say "[The item] [become] [a list of things which proffer the item], redecorating the fountain.";
	repeat with secondary running through things which proffer the item:
		abide by the dangerous construction rules for the secondary.]

Instead of taking the children:
	say "There's no need to attract attention to our new face with a kidnapping charge."

Instead of kissing the children:
	say "I doubt their mothers would approve."

Instead of saying hello to the children:
	say "[one of]They have probably been instructed not to talk to strangers[or]Come on, they're not in the least useful[stopping].".

Instead of asking the children about something:
	say "[one of]They have probably been instructed not to talk to strangers[or]Come on, they're not in the least useful[stopping].".

Instead of telling the children about something:
	say "None of them hold still long enough to listen."

[The fountain itself is similar to one in a plaza in Carcassonne. The horses-to-hoses business was a late-game addition, thanks to Jim Munroe trying to amuse the children.]

The marble fountain is a scenery container. It is in Park center. The description of the fountain is "[if horses are part of the marble fountain]It depicts some horses rising out of the waves, with trident-bearing gods on their backs, and some nymphs overseeing the whole operation. Probably 17th-century, to judge by the excessive number of writhing [figures][else if hoses are part of the marble fountain]The nymphs and trident-bearing gods are now aiming hoses out at passers-by[else if hoe is part of the marble fountain]A single bewildered nymph is carrying a hoe, which presumably isn't much use out at sea[else]The former majesty of the fountain has been extensively vandalized[end if]."
	The introduction is "The fountain celebrates [--] if that's the right word [--] the conquest of this island by the Dutch in 1607, it having been a Spanish possession for about 140 years before that.

In spite of this the fountain bears not a word of any foreign language, the original Latin or vernacular inscriptions having been long since renovated away."

Some horses are part of the marble fountain. Understand "horse" or "horse statues" or "horse sculptures" as the horses. The description of the horses is "Their eyes are wide and their nostrils flared with excitement."

Some sculpted figures are part of the fountain. The description of the sculpted figures is "Nereids and Tritons, apparently, together with tame fish, conch shells, and other representatives of the goods of the sea." Understand "nereids" or "tritons" or "fish" or "shells" or "goods of the sea" or "tame" or "conch" or "gods" or "trident-bearing" or "poseidon" or "neptune" or "nymphs" or "nymph" or "trident" or "god" as the figures.

Instead of searching the fountain:
	say "The basin is nearly full of clear [fountain-water], but there are no coins or other useful articles to be found. This is not a culture that tends to discard what might be of use."

The missing-inscriptions are part of the marble fountain. The printed name is "inscriptions". Understand "inscription" or "inscriptions" or "renovated" or "latin" or "vernacular" or "missing" or "nonexistent" or "non-existent" or "foreign" or "lettering" or "letters" or "words" or "language" or "original" as the missing-inscriptions.

The description of the missing-inscriptions is "Whatever writing once graced the fountain, it has been chiseled off because it wasn't in English."


Instead of listening to a room when the location is in Open-Air:
	if hoses are part of the marble fountain:
		say "The sound of children shrieking and jumping through fountain water is by far the loudest component of the assorted din.";
	else:
		say "Children laughing and shouting, people selling food and drinks, various fairground machinery, tinny music, adult conversations, flowing water in the fountain."


After deciding the scope of the player when the location is in Open-Air:
	place the fountain in scope.

Rule for reaching inside a room:
	if the person reaching is the player:
		say "[We] can only look from this distance.";
	deny access.

Instead of inserting an as into the fountain-water:
	say "Better not. [We] don't want to lose [the noun]."

Instead of examining the fountain-water:
	try searching the fountain.

The fountain-water is in the fountain. The fountain-water is fluid and scenery.
	The indefinite article is "some". The printed name is "water".
	Understand "clear/water" as the fountain-water.
	Instead of taking the fountain-water, say "[We] can't, not having webbed fingers."
	Instead of drinking the fountain-water, say "It might not be sanitary."
	The scent-description of the fountain-water is "wet marble".

Some grass is scenery in the Park Center. The description is "Deep green and velvety."
	Instead of touching the grass: say "[We] kneel and run our fingers through the grass."
	Sanity-check digging in the grass:
		say "It must have taken years of careful upkeep to achieve the smoothness of the present turf. No point in ruining that now." instead.

Rule for distantly describing the Fair:
	say "That way is the fair: a mass of booths and people and games and bright sunlight, too chaotic to get a good look at from here."

The Fair is south of Park Center. The description is "[one of]Today is Serial Comma Day, one of the biggest holidays on the island, and a time when half the police force is off duty while the other half is over-extended. The perfect day to make an escape. [or][stopping]The square at the cen[ter] of town is [one of]therefore [or][stopping]crowded with people, and there's an overpowering smell of artificial butter and spun sugar."

Instead of smelling the Fair:
	say "It smells like candy and popcorn, with a note of booze and another note of sweaty crowd."


The wheel is a thing in the Fair. The heft is 5. The description is "It's the sort of game where you spin the wheel for a prize[if the location is the Fair]. No one seems to be manning or using it any more, though; perhaps the supply of prizes has run out[end if]."

Instead of pushing or pulling the wheel:
	say "The wheel contraption moves a few millimeters to the side. Of course, we could always spin it and see what happens."

Instead of looking under the wheel:
	say "It looks heavy, but is not actually attached to the ground."

Instead of listening to the wheel:
	say "When the wheel is spinning, the flipper makes a satisfying [i]thup thup thup[/i] noise as it flips from one slot to the next."


Understand "use [wheel]" as turning.

Instead of turning the wheel:
	say "[We] give the wheel [one of]a[or]another[stopping] [one of]energetic[or]hard[or]strong[at random] spin. The pointer lands on [one of]HOT AIR[one of], which appears to be the most common reward[or] again[or] yet again[stopping][or]FREE POSTCARD[or]BLUE RASPBERRY LOLLIPOP[or]STUFFED DONKEY[or]STUFFED OCTOPUS[or]SET OF PAINT[or]LIFETIME CHARD SUPPLY[as decreasingly likely outcomes][one of]. Sadly, no one is around to award this prize (which is probably why we were allowed to spin it without having some sort of ticket first)[or]. Too bad no one is around to award the prize. Of course, if someone were, they'd be charging to spin[stopping]."

The random foodstuffs are scenery in the fair. Understand "spun" or "sugar" or "candy" or "butter" or "artificial" or "booze" or "popcorn" as the random foodstuffs.
	The description is "An assortment of unwholesome things to eat are sold here, and since it's extremely hot, [we] smell all of them pungently and in rapid succession. If it's not my imagination, actually, I think this female nose is better than mine. (I've heard that women have a better sense of smell. This could be wrong.) At the moment that sensitivity is a liability, as disorienting as flashes of a col[our]ed strobe.".  [* I wanted to give the sense in the first portion of the game that Alex and Andra are really disoriented by what has happened to them. Some of their sensations are borrowed from what it's like to have a migraine on a hot, sunny day amid a crowd: everything is simply too present to endure, and smells and noises become distinct and offensive even if normally they'd be quite pleasant.]

Some kiosks are fixed in place things in the Fair.  The description of the kiosks is "They're the usual tacky affairs of brightly painted [if the player wears the Britishizing goggles]fibreboard[otherwise]fiberboard[end if] and cheap prizes. I don't see any likely to help us today, however." Understand "activity" or "activities" or "cheap" or "prizes" or "face-painting" or "face painting" or "spell offs" or "spell-offs" as the kiosks.


A ranking rule for the kiosks: increase description-rank of the kiosks by 50.

Definition: the kiosks are deeply dull:
	no.

Rule for writing a topic sentence about kiosks:
	say "[We] are surrounded by [kiosks] for spell-offs, face-painting[if the wheel is in the location], [a wheel] to spin for prizes[end if], and other activities best for small children or the very easily amused. ".

Rule for listing exits when the location is the Fair:
	if boldening is true:
		say "The Fair continues with a selection of carnival games to the [b]west[/b], and with open park to the [b]north[/b] and [b]east[/b].";
	else:
		say "The Fair continues with a selection of carnival games to the west, and with open park to the north and east."

Section 2 - Midway

The Midway is west of the Fair and southwest of Park Center. The description is "Here in front of the [pharmacy] in the southwestern corner of the town square, various contests have been set up [--] a [strong-man contest], a contest to see who can burst the most [balloons] using [a styrofoam dart-plane], and so on."

The description is "There's not much to see, as a shade has been pulled down behind the glass front. I can tell you what's back there, though, if you care: the usual assortment of shampoo and razors and analgesics and burn creams; candy, and also toothpaste; and a costly selection of homeopathic remedies in matching brown bottles."

The blank church wall is a facade in Midway. It fronts west. It is scenery. The description is "The blank wall separates off the church property that lies west of here."
	The closure notice is "The wall is solid here, though the church can be entered from the church forecourt. ".

Instead of going south in Midway:

The initial appearance is "[if the barker is in location]I assume you've noticed, though, [otherwise]No longer so useful is [end if]the [word-balance], which comes up as high as our hip. [balance contents]". The description is "The beam is [if the word-balance is tilting]tilting[otherwise]balanced[end if]. [balance contents]".

A ranking rule for the word-balance: increase description-rank of the word-balance by 50.

Every turn:

A little boy in the crowd snickers rudely. 'Got ya!'[or]The barker gives us a warning look.

This is amateur hour: the real smugglers and counterfeiters and inventors, the [i]pidgitiers[/i], work down by the docks, or in concealed places around town; when you see them out of doors they are always respectable, and their wares are proof against authentication scopes."
	The initial appearance is "Several enterprising salespeople have set out [blankets] on the sidewalk and are hawking wares almost guaranteed to be linguistic counterfeits."
	[The introduction is "The salespeople are particularly daring because they are only a few hundred feet from the front door of the Rotunda.

Contrary to the usual rules of cathedral layout, the [church exterior] is oriented toward the north, so [we] are standing by the flank of the building, though there is an entrance on this side."
	The description is "It manages to be austere without seeming in the least modern: the walls are white and the windows clear, but the proportions, the texture of the plaster, the irregular leading between the panes of glass, all come of the age of handmade things."

On two occasions, the film I was watching burst into flames while it was being shown.

Despite these handicaps, it maintains an active and interested clientele simply by virtue of content: a wide variety of foreign films that, though meticulously dubbed into flawless California-accented English, nonetheless carry that slight tang of the forbidden.

[ The projection booth is here chiefly for easter egg purposes: if the player (much later on) manages to create the abstract LEER, run it through the mirror, and bring the resulting REEL back to the projection booth, the result is this curious movie -- an achievement reward. ]

Report switching on the projector-switch when the reel is in the projector:
	say "[We] flip the switch. [The projector] comes to life with a hum. There's the usual flickering of light and dust, and then a black and white movie begins to play." instead.

Understand "movie" or "black and white" as the reel when the reel position of the reel is greater than 0.

The reel has a number called reel position.

[The reel here is a little bit like the tale, in that it produces a partially randomized story. This time, however, instead of going for a plot, we juxtapose a series of unexplained images and leave it up to the reader to try to imagine a connection between them -- a fires in the desert approach a la Wilmot's End, to borrow the language of Echo Bazaar.

The intention is to suggest an encounter with a slightly inexplicable film that deals with emotional reactions towards the Atlantean threat and all that goes with it.

The filmmaker is Lucius Quagmire, whose manifesto can also be found in the Aquarium Bookstore by the determined searcher.]

Every turn when the reel is in the projector and the projector-switch is switched on (this is the movie advancement rule):
	record "Lucius Quagmire award for viewing unusual films" as an achievement;
	if the location is Projection Booth or the location is Screening Room:

Check inserting something into the projector:
	if the noun is not the reel:
		say "The projector can only really show reels of film." instead;

Understand "thread [reel] on/onto [the projector]" as inserting it into.
Understand "mount [reel] on/onto [the projector]" as inserting it into.

Understand "show [reel] on [the projector]" as showing it on. Showing it on is an action applying to two things.

Instead of mounting the reel:

		try inserting the reel into the projector;
	otherwise:
		say "There is nothing suitable here to mount it on."

Check showing something which is not the reel on the projector:

Check showing the reel on something which is not the projector:
	say "[We] really need a film projector for that." instead.

Check showing something which is not the reel on something which is not the projector:
	say "I could understand if you were trying to show film on a projector, but that suggestion doesn't make much sense to me." instead.

Check showing the reel on the projector when the reel is not in the projector:
	try inserting the reel into the projector;
	if the reel is not in the projector:

Section 2 - Staircase


The Monumental Staircase is east of Park Center and north of Heritage Corner [and south of Outdoor Cafe]. The description is "Once, the [central hillock] of the city was a fortified enclave, protected from the harbor and the peasant town by great walls. Now, however, the walls are mostly gone, except for a little spur that runs north from here. The walkways and tower are open to the public.

Meanwhile a staircase as wide as a street [if the former direction is west]ascends into this town square, with the fountain playing at the cen[ter][otherwise]descends east from the town square toward the harbor[end if]."

Sanity-check going southeast from the Monumental Staircase:
	try going east instead.

Check waving the letter-remover at staircase-close-view when the current setting of the letter-remover is "i":
	say "The device buzzes, puzzled. Sadly it lacks the verve to understand a 'monumental starcase' as a poetic reference to the universe as a whole." instead.

Rule for distantly describing the Monumental Staircase:
	say "Off in that direction is the monumental staircase [if the location is High Street]that leads [up] to the town square, and [we] can just make out the tops of the heads of people standing near it[otherwise]that leads down towards the marina area of town[end if]."

After going to the Monumental Staircase from High Street:
	let N be the number of entries in the described motion of the player;
	if N is greater than 1:
		say "[path-walked so far]";
	otherwise:
		clear path-walked for player;
	if path description count is greater than 0:
		say "From there [we] have";
	otherwise:
		say "[one of][We] have[or]It's[at random]";

	say " [one of]an invigorating[or]a healthy[or]a tiring[or]another wearying[or]yet another exhausting[stopping] climb up[unless N is greater than 1] the Monumental Staircase[end if], with the view of the sea getting better and better as [we] go[one of] (but of course looking requires stopping to gaze back over our shoulder)[or][stopping].[paragraph break]";
	continue the action.

The staircase-close-view is scenery in Monumental Staircase. The printed name is "monumental staircase". Understand "monumental" or "staircase" as staircase-close-view. The description of staircase-close-view is "[We] are standing on one of the upper steps right now, but the staircase descends (if shallowly) for another story or more towards high street." Instead of climbing the staircase-close-view, try going east.

Instead of going down in Monumental Staircase, try going east.

A poster is fixed in place in Monumental Staircase. The initial appearance is "An enormous blue and orange warning [poster] covers the wall alongside the staircase." The description is "'WARNING: Have you seen these dangerous individuals? If so, avoid contact and report all interactions to the Bureau of Orthography.' Below, there's a picture of several people. One of them is you, before your face got shuffled with mine.[one of] It's funny that when we met, you mentioned you were a user of illegally modified language-tools, but you didn't emphas[ize] the grand larceny side so much.

Not to worry. I won't turn you in. I can hardly afford to, can I?[or][stopping]". Understand "blue" or "orange" or "enormous" or "huge" or "warning" as the poster.

A dangerous destruction rule for the poster:
	now the poster is not fixed in place;
	now the initial appearance of the poster is "The blue and orange warning [poster] is rolled up on the ground nearby."

Instead of taking or attacking the poster when the poster is in Monumental Staircase:
	if the poser is seen:
		make no decision;
	say "Defacing official property is illegal [--] like many other things [we][']ve done recently, I suppose [--] but more than usually likely to attract attention."



Fair is southwest of Monumental Staircase. [Postcard Stalls is northwest of Monumental Staircase.]

The central hillock is scenery in Monumental Staircase. The description is "A square park stretches east, with official buildings beyond, occupying what was once the fortified heart of town.

A little of the original fortification does exist immediately north and curving around to the northwest, but it is in very bad shape here, and the top of the walls cannot be walked on at this point." Understand "city" or "fortified" or "walls" or "great" or "enclave" as the hillock.

The harbor-view is a distant backdrop. The printed name is "harbor". It is in Old Hexagonal Turret, Old City Walls, Crumbling Wall Face, Outdoor Cafe, and Monumental Staircase. It screens east and northeast. Understand "port" or "harbor" or "docks" or "dock" as harbor-view. The description is "A harbor swarming with small and medium-sized tourist boats; most of the major shipping comes in via another route." The introduction is "That is where [we] [are] trying to get to [--] or rather, get through."

The fish-market-view is a distant backdrop. The printed name is "fish market". It is in Old Hexagonal Turret, Old City Walls, Crumbling Wall Face, Outdoor Cafe, and Monumental Staircase. Understand "market" or "fish market" as the fish-market-view. The description is "From this angle and distance, all you can see is the open space and a few awnings. It's not the best time of day for this kind of thing anyway."

Instead of going down in the Staircase, try going east. Instead of going up in the Staircase, try going west.

The Open-Air is a region. The Fair, Church Forecourt, Midway, Heritage Corner, [Outdoor Cafe, ] Monumental Staircase, Park Center[, Postcard Stalls, and Food Corner] are in the Open-Air.

Section 3 - The Hostel

The Hostel is east of Heritage Corner. It is indoors. The description is "I take it this is where you stayed from the time you got to town until our operation. I would have expected that someone with your credentials would have been able to afford something better: The Fleur d'Or, maybe? But maybe you thought this was lower-profile. At least it's clean and doesn't smell funny."

Rule for listing exits when the location is the Hostel:
	if looking, say "There's a [h-staircase] that leads up to the dormitory rooms.";
	otherwise say "[We] could either climb the [h-staircase] up to the dormitory rooms or go back to the park, [west]."

The h-staircase is an up-staircase. The h-staircase is in the Hostel. The printed name is "spiral staircase". Understand "spiral" or "staircase" as the h-staircase. It fronts up. The description is "To save space, it winds around a pole twice before reaching the floor above. This is not kind to people with luggage, but people with luggage are supposed to stay in real hotels."

In-direction of the hostel is up. [Into the dormitory]
Out-direction of the hostel is west. [Back out to Heritage Corner]

Instead of facing up in the hostel:
	say "The ceiling is a little cracked but in no way fascinating."

Instead of facing up in the dormitory room:
	say "The ceiling is a little cracked but in no way fascinating."

The attendant's desk is a desk in the Hostel. The description is "Formica with a fake wood grain."

The attendant is a woman in the Hostel. The printed name is "desk attendant". Understand "desk attendant" as the attendant. The initial appearance is "[The attendant] [if the current mood of the attendant is distrustful]watches us suspiciously[otherwise]is sort of eying us[end if]." The description of the attendant is "She's dressed in a kind of casual-hippy way: nose ring, poofy [blouse] that doesn't fit quite right."

The introduction of the attendant is "She doesn't recogn[ize] you [--] us [--] but that's a good thing, I think."

Definition: a thing is attendant-related:
	if it is the attendant, yes;
	if it is enclosed by the attendant, yes;
	no.

Instead of looking at an attendant-related thing through an authentication scope:
	if the noun is the louse:
		do nothing instead;
	say "[The second noun] pings happily as [we] sight [the noun] with the crosshairs. [one of]'Do you mind?' [if the noun is the attendant]she[otherwise]the attendant[end if] asks. 'That's kind of rude.'[or]She sighs pointedly.[or]She mutters about people who can't take hints.[or]She ignores us stoically.[stopping]".

Guidebook is a book in the Hostel. The printed name is "Guidebook to Anglophone Atlantis". Understand "guidebook to atlantis" or "guide" or "book" or "guidebook to anglophone-atlantis" as the guidebook. The initial appearance is "Discarded in one corner is [a guidebook]." The description is "A much-thumbed and several years out-of-date guidebook to this immediate area. The cover is tomato-red but the pages are crinkly and beige: it appears that someone has spilled coffee on it.

There's too much here to take in in a quick read, but we could look up specific topics if we wanted to read more." The contents of the guidebook is the Table of Local Attractions.

After reading a command:
	while the player's command includes "the":
		cut the matched text.

After reading a command:
	if the player's command includes "anglophone atlantis":
		replace the matched text with "anglophone-atlantis".

"aquarium" or "bookstore" or "aquarium bookstore"	"The entry describes the Aquarium Bookstore as a source of used and off-beat new books, especially those pertaining to 'alternate visions of Atlantis'. The phrase 'treasure trove' also appears, though in a context that makes clear this is code for 'fire hazard'."
"bureau/rotunda" or "bureau of orthography" or "orthography"	"The entry is long and greasily flattering: resplendent blue dome, magnificent interior, warm and hospitable employees, world-renowned historical research department, etc., etc., etc."
"Serial Comma Day" or "holiday"	"Commemorating the 1935 standard[ization] of a whole range of punctuation conventions, Serial Comma Day is one of three major patriotic holidays on Anglophone Atlantis. (See also SHAPLY DAY, SECESSION DAY.)"
"Shaply Day"	"Named in hon[our] of pioneering suffragette Phyllida Shaply, Shaply Day commemorates the 1877 decision to allow all citizens of Anglophone Atlantis to vote in referenda (the direct-democracy form for deciding contentious issues). This right was extended regardless of race, gender, or creed and is a source of considerable pride to Atlanteans."
"Secession Day" or "secession"	"The secession of Atlantis from British governance in 1823 culminated in the reduction of the attacking British fleet on April 19. The holiday celebrates this occasion, which is considered the beginning of Atlantean self-rule."
"cannon" or "depluralizing" or "depluralizing cannon" or "hexagonal" or "turret" or "depluralising" or "depluralising cannon"	"The Guidebook explains that Atlantis['] harb[our]s were traditionally defended by the deplural[izing] cannon, using techniques discovered by Clarence Arbot in 1779. Turrets along the old city walls provided elevated positions for these cannons, allowing them considerable range. See also SECESSION, CLARENCE ARBOT."
"sigil street" or "sigil"	"The entry on Sigil Street proclaims it an excellent place for those seeking to commission their own fonts or indulge in other typographical expenses."
"ampersand bend" or "ampersand/bend"	"Ampersand Bend is notable to the guidebook chiefly for the presence of a fine museum. A little less fine now that we've been past, perhaps."
"long street" or "long"	"Long Street is recorded as a go-to spot for high-end shopping and restaurant experiences."
"customs house" or "customs/house"	"The book offers advice that verges on churlish about how important it is not to commit any type of customs violation."
"clarence" or "arbot" or "clarence Arbot"	"A little copperplate engraving of a man with heavy-lidded eyes accompanies the sidebar biography of Clarence Arbot: b. 1732, proud parent of some 19 children; tireless researcher who in later years rarely left his laboratory 'except to go to bed'; in 1779, the inventor of generic deplural[ization], allowing multiples of almost anything to be reduced to just one.

"james/elias/milford/higgate" or "milford higgate" or "james elias" or "q-insertion"	"Milford Higgate and James Elias are commonly credited with the discovery of Q-insertion: the letter Q was the first that anyone was able to add to a word.

Thanks to its overwhelming significance to the local economy, DCL enjoys significant privileges in terms of support for its espionage policies. DCL builds a wide variety of machines for linguistic efficacy, but its most public[ize]d efforts are in the area of letter-insertion. The company was originally formed to work on T, D, and N-insertion."
"airport/airplane/airline/plane"	"There are no airports on the island that support commercial flights, though there is a landing strip for corporate jets coming in to the DCL campus."
"language/text/linguistics" or "linguistic efficacy"	"The Guidebook points out rather primly that only English is spoken on the island, due to the island's early discovery of linguistic efficacy. Except in special contexts such as sanctioned language classes, attempts to make oneself understood in other tongues will lead to shunning and possibly even jail time."
"history/past"	"The Guidebook gives a thumbnail description, and an extremely biased one, of how linguistic efficacy was discovered and put to use on the island, and its subsequent rise as an independent power when many other states were being absorbed into the empires of England, Spain, France, the Netherlands, etc. This is a bit rich considering that before achieving this independence Atlantis was in fact successively a Spanish, Dutch, and English territory; but local publishers tend to gloss that point a bit. See also MUSEUM."
"lodging/lodgings"	"The guidebook describes two options in the center of town: the hostel, suitable for people on a budget, and the much more expensive Fleur D'Or hotel."
"fleur d'or" or "fleur" or "hotel/hotels" or "fleur d'or hotel"	"The Fleur D'Or is listed as the town's only four-star hotel. (There are no five-star hotels on this island. It is not that kind of place.) As the Fleur d'Or principally attracts those interested in business or research to do with linguistic efficacy, it also maintains a bar with the only publicly-licensed homonym paddle. Visitors to the Fleur d'Or Drinks Club can enjoy linguistically-generated gimlets, rusty nails, and more."
"museum/exhibit/museums/exhibits"	"A museum of linguistic instruments open to the public is to be found on the grounds of the Fleur d'Or hotel."
"fountain" or "town square/park" or "park"	"The fountain is listed as one of the attractions of the old town park: the design and execution of the sculpture credited to one M. Antoinne, and was apparently his final work before he faced a firing squad for his use of an irregular surname. (This was during one of the more blood-soaked episodes of standard[ization], evidently.)"
"cinema/theater/theatre/movie/movies" or "movie theater/theatre"	"The Guidebook lists the cinema at the north end of the town park as the best place to see films 'correctly and legally dubbed'."
"hostel" or "backpacker"	"Mysteriously, the entry for the hostel itself, which ought to contain ratings of its cleanliness, safety, and reliability, has been obliterated with a black marker."
"[transit]" or "station" or "bus station"	"The book is forthright about the absence of public transportation, and recommends that visitors bent on vehicular travel should bring their own cars, since none are available locally for rent. A bus station with long-distance service cross-island to the town of Maiana can be found near Monument Green, though routes are not always served on holidays."
"fair/fairground/fairs/fairgrounds" or "market" or "farmer's market"	"The guidebook is lyrical about the phenomenal produce to be enjoyed at the farmer's market held in Hesychius Street every Saturday and Wednesday and also on special days of observation."
"fish market"	"The fish market, the guidebook explains, may be found at the northeastern part of town near the docks, and holds most of its sales in the early morning."
"dock/docks/boat/boats/ferry/ferries"	"The guidebook gives us to understand that the docks, found northeast of the central town, are a pleasant place to commission short voyages of exploration and to see the island from a distance. It does, however, warn against spending too much time in the adjacent taverns, which have an unsavory reputation."
"tavern/taverns" or "counterfeit" or "monkey" or "counterfeit monkey"	"The Counterfeit Monkey is a tavern of unsavory reputation near to the docks, said to be the locale of more fistfights and disturbances of the peace than the rest of the city put together. The tavern is named in hon[our] of a famous linguistic con job and was a regular site for contraband creation and smuggling. In 1929, the Bureau first developed tools and procedures for identifying linguistic fakes, the Monkey was the target of a law enforcement raid; but a lively and committed criminal community soon put the Monkey in business again with new strategies."
"all-purpose" or "all purpose"	"The All-Purpose, the guidebook explains, is a general civil servant attached to the Bureau of Orthography, with wide-ranging powers to repair, correct, and heal using a variety of linguistic tools."
"university/college/education"	"The guidebook praises the many excellent departments and exceptional research work performed at the university. This is all true, naturally."
"new church/cathedral" or "church/cathedral"	"The guidebook devotes two and a half pages to the splendors of the New Church, located on the western edge of the town square. It particularly admires the clean lines of the architecture, the solidly constructed pews, and the austere decoration; in fact, the more you read, the more the guide seems to be rhapsod[izing] about what the builders left [i]out[/i], instead of what they put in. The guide also recommends a visit to the church gift shop, which apparently supports assorted worthy causes, such as, for instance, buying a new roof for the structure and paying a custodial staff."
"food/eating/dining/restaurant/restaurants/eateries/cafe/cafes/café/bistro/cafés/eatery/lunch/dinner/breakfast"	"The guidebook lists several places to eat around town: the outdoor café near the docks; a Food Corner sometimes found in the town square; the restaurant attached to the Fleur D'Or hotel."
"lucius" or "quagmire" or "lucius quagmire" or "disturbance of meaning"	"A brief and plainly expurgated entry indicates that Lucius Quagmire was a film-maker in the early part of the 20th century who founded the Disturbance of Meaning group with the intention to  undermine the Anglophone hegemony. He was convicted of treason."


Every turn when the attendant carries a louse:
	say "The attendant screams, and performs some kind of strange dance, first brushing at her skin and then stomping at something on the ground. (So much for the louse, I think.)

She then tears out of the room, leaving the room unattended. Unfortunately, places like this don't keep anything of value out front anyway, so your natural gift for larceny hasn't much scope here.";
	move the louse to the repository;
	now the attendant is nowhere;
	if the attendant is the current interlocutor:
		reset the interlocutor.

The attendant wears a nose-ring and a blouse. The description of the blouse is "White cotton with little ribbons on it. I hate that kind of frilly nonsense."

Four [random dorm bed]s are lined up against the wall."

A dorm bed is usually scenery.

Four dorm beds are in the dormitory room. Understand "beds" as a dorm bed. The description of a dorm bed is "At this time of day, since everyone is checked out, the beds are all stripped down to bare mattress. Linens may be rented at the front desk [--] but [we][']re not staying here tonight, so there's no need to experience the thinning sheets and the pilled [if the player wears the Britishizing goggles]woollen[otherwise]woolen[end if] blankets. Your memory is enough for both of us."


A backpacking girl is an alert tourist woman in the dormitory room. She exhibits caution.
	The initial appearance is "[one of]A girl of about 19 [set prior to backpacking girl][if the girl is in the location]is standing in the middle of the room, looking around as though she can't quite believe where she landed or what she's doing here[otherwise]seems to be inclined to hang out here for the duration[end if][or][The backpacking girl] is still hanging out here[stopping]."
	The description is "She is just the sort of tourist who most annoys the locals, but actually I find her type a little endearing: she may not be very sophisticated yet, but she [i]wants[/i] to expand her horizons, and that's more than you can say for most of the friends she probably left back at home.".
	The backpacking girl wears a pink t-shirt. The description of the pink t-shirt is "It is somewhat too tight and bears the word JUICY in rhinestones across the bust." Understand "shirt" or "t-shirt" as the pink t-shirt.

Does the player mean finding the backpacking girl:
	if player's command includes "girl":
		it is very likely.

Check waving the letter-remover at pink t-shirt when the current setting of the letter-remover is "r":
	say "That would be intriguingly disgusting, if it weren't for the fact that T-SHIT doesn't describe anything anyone with a functional colon has ever heard of." instead.

Test girl-description with "look" in the Dormitory Room.

Instead of opening the heavy pack in the presence of the backpacking girl:
	say "Overtly searching her possessions while she is here seems like a ticket to trouble."

The heavy pack contains an assortment of very short shorts, a broomstick skirt, flip-flops, bikini bottoms, various t-shirts, an anorak, a fat guidebook to Europe, a cheap camera, and a box of tampons.

The bikini bottoms are wearable.

The description of the various t-shirts is "There's not a one without a logo of some kind."

The t-shirts are wearable.

Check waving the letter-remover at various t-shirts when the current setting of the letter-remover is "r":

The description of the cheap camera is "It is a flimsy device in rose-pink, with a very small lens."

Instead of inserting something into the heavy pack when the backpacking girl does not carry the heavy pack:
	if the heavy pack is closed:
		say "[The heavy pack] isn't open." instead;
	otherwise:
		say "[The heavy pack] is full." instead.

Instead of taking something which is in the heavy pack:
	say "The girl may be a bit foolish, but she doesn't deserve to be robbed on the first day of her trip."
	[say "None of these are any use just now."]

Chiding-attendant is a scene. Chiding-attendant begins when the dormitory room is visited. Chiding-attendant ends in results when the location of the player is the dormitory room and the location of the backpacking girl is the dormitory room and the backpacking girl recollects have-you-checked and the current quip is not have-you-checked and the current quip is not agree about the attendant and the backpacking girl is finished talking and the attendant is in the Hostel.

Chiding-attendant ends fruitlessly when the location of the backpacking girl is not the dormitory room.

[We want to be set up by the girl's prior complaint, but we don't want the attendant to seem to come in response to said complaint.]

When chiding-attendant ends in results:
	say "There's a heavy tread on the stairs, and the desk attendant puts her head in. 'Just so you two know, you're not actually supposed to be hanging out a lot up here during the day. It's for night use really. I'm not going to do anything today, but it's kind of against the rules, for future reference.'

She turns around and goes back down. The backpacking girl sticks her tongue out at the departing back.".

[Something I wanted to do was try to break down the sense that NPCs are attached to single locations and never move around or interact with one another. On the other hand, scenes where NPCs move freely or converse in groups are harder to engineer, so I wanted to be sparing with those. So there are assorted intermediate effects where we get a little 'fake' interaction, a one-turn-only moment where one NPC addresses another or a character moves around.]

Report scoffing when chiding-attendant ended in results and the time since chiding-attendant ended is less than 2 minutes and the current interlocutor is the backpacking girl:
	say "We snort, and the girl grins at us. 'I know, she is unreal!'" instead.

Report laughing when chiding-attendant ended in results and the time since chiding-attendant ended is less than 2 minutes and the current interlocutor is the backpacking girl:
	say "We laugh, and the girl joins in. 'I know, she is unreal!'" instead.

Report frowning when chiding-attendant ended in results and the time since chiding-attendant ended is less than 2 minutes and the current interlocutor is the backpacking girl:
	say "We frown.

'Oh, whatever,' says the girl. 'She deserves it.'" instead.

Instead of waving the letter-remover at the locker when the backpacking girl is marked-visible:
	try taking the locker.

Instead of waving the letter-remover at the lock when the backpacking girl is marked-visible:
	try taking the lock.

An accessibility rule when the touch-goal is the lock or the touch-goal is the locker:
	if the backpacking girl is marked invisible:
		make no decision;
	otherwise:
		say "[The backpacking girl] is watching our every move with unconcealed curiosity, which makes me a little hesitant to do anything with the locker[one of][or]. Maybe if we freaked her out somehow she would go away[or]. I think our best bet is to show her something that really weirds her out[stopping]." instead.

After writing a paragraph about a dorm bed:
	now every dorm bed in the location is mentioned.

Some hard wood floors are scenery in the Dormitory room. Understand "floor" or "hardwood" or "protective" or "gloss" or "coating" as the hard wood floors. The description is "The floors are designed to be scrubbed clean every single day, leaving no trace of what might have come or gone."

Instead of putting something on the hard wood floors, try dropping the noun.

The locker is a fixed in place closed openable container in the Dormitory Room. The lock is part of the locker. The initial appearance of the locker is "The [locker] you identify as your own sits near one of the beds[if the locker is open], door standing open[otherwise if the lock is part of the locker], still locked with its dial [lock-name][otherwise], closed but not locked[end if]. ".

A ranking rule for the locker:
	increase description-rank of the locker by 100.

The description of the locker is "A standard metal [locker] for travelers to leave their valuable possessions in when they go out [--] or while they sleep, since one's bunkmates are not always to be trusted. It is of the kind that requires the traveler to bring his own lock[if the lock is part of the locker], and in fact someone (such as yourself) has put a lock on this one[otherwise], but it is currently bare[end if]."

After opening the locker:
	record "opening the locker" as achieved;
	complete "Retrieve your remaining possessions from locker at hostel";
	say "Now that the lock has been removed, the locker swings easily open[if the locker is non-empty], revealing [a list of things *in the locker][end if]." instead.

The lock can be lockable. The lock can be locked. The lock can be openable. The lock can be open. The lock is openable, lockable and locked. Understand "dial" as the lock.

Instead of turning the lock:
	say "The dial turns smoothly [--] much too smoothly. There are no clicks, no tiny ticks of inward mechanisms working. By the feel of it, there might be no real locking device here at all."

Understand the command "spin" as "turn".

The description of the lock is "[one of]It's curious, now you look at it: it's a combination lock with a dial face, but no one has bothered putting any numerals onto the dial.[or]Still no numbers on the dial. My mother had a wristwatch like that once. Always a nuisance.[or]I once again contemplate the absence of traditional combination markings on the lock. It must not be meant to be unlocked in the usual way.[or]It's your lock: you brought it with you and put it on the locker. So you must have had some way of opening it again, and not something that would depend on having a clear memory after the operation, either. I don't suppose you remember at all?[stopping]".

To say lock-name:
	now the lock is seen;
	say "[if boldening is true][bold type][end if][printed name of the lock][roman type]"

To say key-refusal for (locked-thing - the lock):
	say "[lock description][paragraph break]".

Instead of setting the lock to something:
	say "No numbers are written on the dial of the lock."

Locking something with something is key-related behavior. Unlocking something with something is key-related behavior. Unlocking keylessly something is key-related behavior. Locking keylessly something is key-related behavior. Opening something is key-related behavior. Closing something is key-related behavior.

Instead of key-related behavior when the current action involves the locker and the lock is part of the locker:
	if the noun is the locker, now the noun is the lock;
	if the second noun is the locker, now the second noun is the lock;
	try the current action.

Instead of attacking the locker with something:
	say "It is built to withstand attack, as witness the several dents in the frame that nonetheless failed to pop the door out."

Instead of attacking or pulling or pushing the lock:
	say "It swings jauntily in place, but does not break."


The locker contains a roll of bills and a letter. The printed name of the roll of bills is "roll". The description of the roll of bills is "[one of]Now that is more like it: you've got us a tidy little stash of euros here.[or]Some day you will have to tell me a little bit about the tricks of the trade [--] how you fenced stuff, you know? Or perhaps you won't tell me. Maybe it would be better not. At any rate, this money is useful, so I won't ask too many questions.[or]It's our cash reserve [--] well, your cash reserve, really, but for now it is serving both of us.[stopping]". Understand "euros" or "euro" or "cash" or "bill" or "money" as the bills.

The bills are essential.


[Andra's backstory was based in the idea that she was an extraordinarily good speller, and I imagined a whole history for her, in which she had been a homeschooled spelling champion who ran away from home when she was disappointed by her parents' reaction to her coming in second place nationally. Slango had seen her on television and so when he recognized her on a street, he picked her up and inducted her into his smuggling gang.

There wasn't room to tell that whole story in Counterfeit Monkey, and eventually I spun that story off as Bee, a Varytale novella which takes place in more or less the real world.

Nonetheless, Andra retains some pointers to that history.]

The description of the letter is "It's a letter from your brother, printed off anonymously from an untraceable email account that you accessed in town. Nothing that could be followed back to Slango and the yacht.

[i]Sis,

I'm keeping your wire transfer funds. I want to try for Stanford.

I'd say thank you except that, one, you didn't get it legally (I saw this documentary about teen prostitutes [--] if that's where it came from then EW) and, two, honestly? You owe for what you put us through after you ran away. Mom and Dad were humiliated that you turned into the prodigal daughter. Your face got on milk cartons. Pastor Hughes GAVE A SERMON ABOUT IT.

Mom spent all that time coaching you through spelling practice, you know she doesn't enjoy getting up at 4 AM, right? You totally threw that in their faces.

If you want to come home sometime, fine, but don't come to just see me. If you want to see me you have to see Mom and Dad too.

Nate.[/i]".



Some secret-plans are in the locker. They are privately-named.
	The printed name is "plans".
	Understand "plan" or "plans" as the secret-plans.
	The description of the secret-plans is "The plans are rolled up and stuck shut with a label that reads 'PROPERTY OF DENTAL CONSONANTS LIMITED [--] UNAUTHOR[IZE]D USE ILLEGAL'. They're just a set of prints from the main computer design, of course, but still extremely informative: to the right engineer, they might reveal the secret of T-insertion for replication by other companies. These are what you and Brock were originally contracted to lift from the island, at a fee in the multiple millions.". The secret-plans are essential, illegal, floppy, and long. Understand "tube" as the secret-plans when the tube is marked invisible. Understand "label" as the secret-plans.

Understand "count [bills]" as a mistake ("[We] thumb quickly through the bills [--] smaller currency on the outside, larger denominations on the inside. I wouldn't have thought I could add that quickly and accurately, but you, evidently, have more practice. It works out to just over fifteen thousand euros.").



Section 4 - The New Church

The New Church is west of the Church Forecourt. It is indoors and proper-named. The description is "Not a Gothic cathedral from the era when the church was wealthy and secure, but a gallant Neo-classical response to the turmoil of the 18th century, when the power of language was just beginning to be evident, and instead of an immutable cosmology, we suddenly had observer-consensus reality. [one of]What is the need or use of God, if it turns out that He gave all the power of creation to Adam when He let him name the animals?[or][stopping]".

The inscription is fixed in place in the New Church. It is distant. The initial appearance is "An [inscription] above [the altar], picked out in gold paint, reads Ἐν ἀρχῇ ἦν ὁ λόγος." Understand "paint" or "gold" as the inscription.
	The description is "It means, In the Beginning was the Word.

A patchy attempt to make theology align with scientific and linguistic reality, but it still has power. And despite the Bureau's depredations of foreign language writings everywhere else, they have never quite had the nerve to deface this."

Some columns are scenery in the New Church. The description of the columns is "The column shafts are unornamented, only tapering a little at the top; the capitals a restrained Ionic." Understand "pillar" or "pillars" or "column" as the columns.

The introduction of New Church is "My mother volunteers here: I think I should warn you. She is not quite religious, but believes in the cultural value of the building, and in having some sort of place where people can go for spiritual respite. She also, I suspect, likes having those great gold letters, defiantly foreign and arcane in the heart of the old city."

Some pews are a scenery supporter in the New Church. The description of the pews is "Simply built out of dark solid wood, to contrast with the white walls and columns, and the clear glass windows." Understand "pew" or "seat" or "seats" or "bench" or "benches" as the pews.

Does the player mean approaching New Church:
	it is very likely.

Definition:
	a thing is liturgical:
		if it is the cross, yes;
		if it is the cassock, yes;
		if it is the tippet, yes.

Instead of putting something on the altar:
	if the player wears a liturgical thing:
		if the noun is the cross:
			record "Reverend Plaice award for placing the cross on the altar while liturgically dressed" as an achievement;
			continue the action;
		else:
			say "While I am not exactly a believer in the dogmas associated with this place, it seems crass to go putting random items on the altar.";
	else:
		say "[We] [are] not vested appropriately for dressing the altar; someone would be sure to notice."

The description of the altar is "It is simple and bare of cloth or flowers[if the cross is on the altar], though a cross is set in the appropriate place[end if]."

Instead of facing up in the New Church:
	say "The ceiling is handsomely solid but not decorated: no painted feet of the ascendant Christ dangling down between clouds, no medieval grotesques or floral bosses."

Instead of going north in the New Church:
	say "The only thing in that direction is the little space behind the altar, and to enter that seems like needless trespassing."

Rule for listing exits when the location is New Church:
	if boldening is true:
		say "There are side exits both [b]east[/b] and [b]west[/b]; and a gift shop occupies the narthex at the [b]south[/b] end.";
	else:
		say "There are side exits both east and west; and a gift shop occupies the narthex at the south end."

Understand "pray" or "pray to [text]" as a mistake ("[prayer response]").

To say prayer response:

The Cathedral Gift Shop is south of the New Church. Understand "narthex" and "giftshop" as the cathedral gift shop. It is indoors. The description is "This area used to be a sort of antechamber where the priests and choir might gather for processions into the church, but it has now been done over for retail purposes. This is one of several schemes to make the New Church pay for its own upkeep: a problem is that people somehow feel everything associated with a church ought to be free, including lunchtime concerts, potluck suppers, and Thursday-night lecture series."

The gift-shop counter is a scenery supporter in the Cathedral Gift Shop. The description is "The usual arrangement for making purchases."

Some wire racks are scenery things in the Cathedral Gift Shop. The description is "They're designed to hold postcards or other similar small merchandise." Understand "rack" as racks.

Some postcards are on the wire racks. The description of the postcards is "You may be a tourist in these parts, but I, my curious friend, am not: so I find these pictures all rather foolish, and not at all representative of the town as it really is."

Understand "harbor" or "city walls" or "walls" or "fortifications" or "ancient fortifications" or "cards" or "harbour" or "picture" or "architecture" or "pictures" as the postcards when the location is cathedral gift shop.

Instead of taking the postcards:
	say "And send them where? There is no one [we] wish were here."

Instead of taking the paper-models:
	say "I am all thumbs and never get these things right."

The description of the paper-models is "With four or five hours['] lab[our], and a quantity of white glue and toothpicks, you too could assemble your very own rendition of the church, complete with windows and a printed-on version of the inscription over the altar; in fact, the model is so cleverly made that it can be taken apart to allow a view in cross-section."

The introduction of the paper-models is "Despite all that, I think [we][']ll pass."

The gift shop volunteer wears a knitted wool cap. The description of the knitted wool cap is "It is made of some kind of soft and fuzzy blue yarn." Understand "yarn" as the knitted wool cap.

The Church Garden is west of New Church. The description is "One might expect a graveyard, but burial inside the city walls has been forbidden for sanitation reasons since well before the New Church was built. Instead, there is a small meditation garden, which was once designed as an intricate knotwork of shrubs[if the thicket is not in the location]. Now the shrubs are gone[end if]."

In-direction of Church Garden is east. [Back into the church]

Report facing in Church Garden:
	say "The garden is intentionally a space set apart, from which it is hard to see anything of the rest of the world." instead.

	if the soil is not in Church Garden, say "There is no longer anywhere for the thicket to grow." instead;
	if the ticket is not in Church Garden
	begin;

The Two-Star Hotel is north of the Bus Station. The description is "This is a very different place from the Fleur D'Or, and different, too, from your backpacking hostel. There is a carpet, which is clean but old. The lobby features a single sofa, which has thin cushions and does not promise comfort or luxury. The front desk is veneered in fake walnut. It is unmanned."

Some carpet is in the Two-Star Hotel. It is scenery.
	The description is "It is deep red, a color likely chosen for its capacity to hide stains, and there is a pattern on it of tiny grey diamonds, so that it looks rather as though someone's tie had been made the basis of an entire room design."

A hotel sofa is an enterable supporter in the Two-Star hotel. It is scenery. The initial appearance is "No one has to sit there at the moment, which is the key point."

The front desk is a scenery supporter in the Two-Star hotel. The description of the front desk is "No one is sitting there now; but this entire time of year must be a bit of a slump for the hotel, since there is not a busy tourist trade running through on its way to buses out of town."

Rule for listing exits while in Two-Star hotel: say "To the east, through an archway in which an ineffective curtain hangs, is the room by which the hotel actually makes the majority of its easy money: there it rents out luggage-storage space to persons using the bus station."

Part 4 - Affluence

Chapter 1 - City Walls

Section 1 - Old City Walls

Old City Walls are north of the Monumental Staircase. Understand "wall" as Old City Walls. The description is "Only portions of the old walls still stand, but you can walk along what remains, as though you were defending the place. They're a me[ter] and a half wide, made of ashlar blocks. On the vertical faces these blocks are still rough, but underfoot they have been worn smooth by the passage of many defenders and (subsequently) tourists. One of the [defaced ashlar block]s in the wall has even been defaced, some old inscription gouged out.[one of]

I used to like to climb around up here when I was a kid. I made believe[--] oh, you'll think it's silly.[or][stopping]

Down below in the distance are the docks and the sea, and immediately east of here is an old hexagonal [turret-view]."

The defaced ashlar block is scenery in Old City Walls. Understand "blocks" or "ashlar" or "inscription" as block. The description is "To judge by its different shaping and col[our], the defaced block is something borrowed from an older building to make up the new wall: taken out of a church or a mosque or perhaps even a Roman fortification in some earlier era of the island.

It was once inscribed with a message, but whatever it was, the foreign-language writing has been completely chiseled away so as to be illegible.".

Rule for printing the name of the defaced ashlar block while looking:
	say "block".

Instead of putting the restoration gel on the defaced ashlar block:
	say "The gel has no ability to restore that which was physically damaged; only letter-changes can be removed."

Rule for listing exits when looking in Old City Walls:
	do nothing instead.

In-direction of Old City Walls is east. [Into the old hexagonal turret]

Turret-view is a facade in Old City Walls. It fronts east. It is scenery. The printed name is "turret". Understand "old" or "hexagonal" or "tower" or "turret" as turret-view. The description is "The turret extends to the east. It's one of the best preserved pieces of the old wall."

Section 2 - The Turret

The Old Hexagonal Turret is east of Old City Walls. The description is "Up here [we] stand on the remains of the old fortifications; this turret offers a view out over the docks, the fish market, and the harbor, which it was designed to protect."

Out-direction of Old Hexagonal Turret is west. [Back to old city walls]

The depluralizing cannon is a container in the Old Hexagonal Turret. It is fixed in place. Understand "heavy" or "old" or "barrel" as the depluralizing cannon. The printed name is "deplural[izing] cannon".
	The initial appearance is "A heavy old [depluralizing cannon] is aimed out to sea."
	The description is "Like a conventional cannon it has a mounting to allow the users to turn the gun and change its angle, to hit objects at various ranges.

It is currently unloaded, of course; but time was when this vast weapon was employed to reduce entire fleets to a single ship, and a whole crew of marines to a single man. This tactic was found so effective that the harbor was never successfully taken."

Sanity-check turning or pushing or pulling the depluralizing cannon:
	say "With considerable effort, we manage to point the cannon a little more [one of]towards the open sea[or]towards the docks[or]towards the cliffs opposite[cycling]. Not that that does any good." instead.

The deep purple residue is part of the depluralizing cannon. The description is "Deplural[izing] shot is usually a very dark purple near to black, and some may have scraped off on the inside of the barrel."
	The scent-description is "smoke and leather".

Instead of searching the depluralizing cannon:
	say "There's nothing to see inside the old barrel except perhaps the faintest traces of a [deep purple residue]."

Sanity-check inserting something into the depluralizing cannon:
	say "No doubt it would be interesting to fire [the noun] out over the marina, but it's neither possible nor wise." instead.

Sanity-check entering the depluralizing cannon:
	say "Col[our]ful as it would be to climb into the cannon and fire ourselves straight out to sea, this is not a viable option. I would have tried it before now if it were." instead.

Instead of facing south in Old Hexagonal Turret:
	say "That way is mostly empty air, though if [we] look south and down over the edge, there is a vertiginous view down to the bottom of the monumental staircase. Tourists and natives are climbing up and down."

The mounting is part of the depluralizing cannon. The description is "Everything is stiff and motionless now."

Instead of turning or pushing or pulling the mounting:
	say "No matter what [we] do [we] won't be able to aim or fire the old cannon; which is just as well, since to do so would be a major felony under local penal code, and a war crime under international conventions."

Understand "fire [cannon]" or "load [cannon]" or "aim [cannon]" or "use [cannon]" as a mistake ("[We] haven't got the shot for this thing, and for very good reason. There may not even be any still in existence, but if there is, the Bureau will keep it under lock and key.").

Section 3 - The Walls Crumble

Crumbling Wall Face is north of the Old City Walls. The description is "The wall once continued north from here some distance before curving northwest around the remainder of the city. So much has crumbled away, though, that the walkway is impassable north of this point. To protect citizens, there is a [safety railing] across the [view of jagged wall].

A [metal ladder] of four rungs descends the inner face of the wall, allowing pedestrians access to the streets to the west."

Sanity-check going north in Crumbling Wall Face:
	say "The wall pretty much falls away into slippery rubble at that point, which is why there's a safety railing in the way." instead.

rule for listing exits while looking in Crumbling Wall Face:
	do nothing instead.

Instead of facing southeast in Crumbling Wall Face:
	say "[We] would have to go south and then east to reach it, but that way is the top of the hexagonal turret."

The fossil is a thing in Crumbling Wall Face. The initial appearance is "Among the rubble fill of the wall is [if we have examined the fossil]a fossil[otherwise]an odd spiral-shaped rock[end if]."
	Understand "odd" or "spiral-shaped" or "spiral" or "shaped" or "rock" or "stone" as the fossil.
	The description is "[one of]The spiral rock turns out to be a fossil, from one of those sea creatures long ago.[or]It is perhaps an inch and a half long, the shape of a corkscrew seashell that once housed something small and soft. There are thousands of these things around; they're not exactly valuable, but an interesting curiosity all the same.[stopping]".

Instead of taking the fossil when the fossil is not handled:
	say "[We] pick it up. [description of fossil][line break]";
	move fossil to player.

Instead of examining the view of jagged wall when we have not examined the fossil:
	try examining the fossil.

The view of jagged wall is a distant backdrop in Crumbling Wall Face. It screens north. The printed name is "broken edge".

The description is "The masonry has broken away, revealing the rubble fill inside the wall and making a dangerously unstable surface of craggy rocks.". Understand "edge" or "broken" or "rubble" or "craggy" or "rocks" or "gravel" or "unstable" or "jagged" or "masonry" as the view of jagged wall. Understand "rock" as the view of jagged wall when the rock is marked invisible and the fossil is marked invisible.

The safety railing is scenery in Crumbling Wall Face. The description is "Though it shows traces of surface rust, the safety railing is sturdy and close-fitted enough to prevent anyone, child or adult, from taking a tumble down the jagged masonry.". Understand "rail" as the safety railing.

Instead of turning or pulling or pushing the safety railing:
	say "It proves gratifyingly resistant to your attempts."

Instead of climbing the safety railing:
	say "It's here for our protection."

The metal ladder is a down-staircase in Crumbling Wall Face. It is fixed in place. The description is "The rungs [if the noun is not the metal ladder]of the ladder [end if]have been bolted individually into the stone." Understand "rungs" or "rung" as the metal ladder.

Instead of going down in Crumbling Wall Face, try going west.

The Walltop is a region. The Old City Walls, the Crumbling Wall Face, and the Old Hexagonal Turret are in The Walltop.

Instead of listening to a location in Walltop:
	say "The noises that reach us are the sounds of distant traffic, the occasional horn blast from the docks, and some cheery shouting from the direction of the fair."

Test wallbug with "tutorial on / n" in Crumbling Wall Face.

Chapter 2 - Residential District

Section 1 - Hesychius Street

Hesychius Street is west of Old City Walls. The description is "As the street names make obvious, this part of town was laid out in a different political age, when it was considered more important to commemorate linguistic richness than to standard[ize] practices[if Webster court is unvisited].

This is also the edge of the richest part of town, with houses [--] really, almost villas [--] that were built for households with servants. My parents['] place is just a block or two north of here[end if][if the farmer's stall is in Hesychius Street].

On holidays like today, this street is often host to a farmer's market; though it is now late enough in the day that most of the farmers have given up and gone home, taking with them their twenty-three varieties of pickled olives, their loganberry jam, and their pigs[']-feet-in-aspic[otherwise].

Even the single farmer from earlier is now gone[end if]."

A fortified villa is a scenery facade in Hesychius Street. It fronts west. The description is "An especially solid and safe-looking villa with no entrance on this side. It was built, originally, by the head of the customs office, when that post was somewhat more dangerous than it is today. I admit I don't know who lives there now."
	The closure notice is "There are no doors in [the item described] from this angle. ".

Rule for listing exits when looking in Hesychius Street:
	do nothing.

A farmer's stall is scenery in Hesychius Street. The description is "It appears to belong to the farmer. It's made of wood and canvas and offers a little shade against the harsh sun. Previous customers have cleared most of it off[if the farmer is non-empty], but the farmer still has [a list of things *in the farmer][end if]."

Rule for printing the name of farmer's stall while looking:
	say "stall".

The farmer is a man in the Hesychius Street. The description is "Contrary to your obvious expectations, he is dressed more or less like anyone else, and is neither wearing quaint overalls nor chewing a piece of hay."

Rule for writing a paragraph about the farmer:
	say "One remaining [farmer] lazes here, watching his [farmer's stall].";
	now every thing carried by the farmer is mentioned.

In-direction of Webster Court is north. [Into my parent's house]

Instead of facing west in Webster Court:
	say "The old city wall cuts off any view towards the harbor and the far horizon. The taller houses permit a view over, however."

Instead of facing northwest in Webster Court:
	say "Roget Close is west, but there's no passage or street running northwest."

[Instead of facing northeast in Webster Court:
	say "[We] could go that way around behind my parents' house and enjoy their garden. They " ]

Rule for distantly describing Webster Court:
	say "In that direction is Webster Court, as made unmistakable by the gleaming bronze pate of old Noah himself."

A description-concealing rule:
	if the statue of Noah Webster is not as-yet-unknown:

The statue of Noah Webster is a fixed in place thing in Webster Court. The initial appearance is "Lending its name to the location is a bronze statue of Noah Webster."
	Understand "bronze" as the statue.
	The description is "It's that hero of spelling reform, and personally responsible for the island going over to American[ize]d spellings over the British standard."
	The introduction is "My mother likes to irritate my father by quoting what his contemporaries called Webster: a 'viper', a 'maniacal pedant', and (always a fav[our]ite at Reform Day parties) 'a toad in the service of [i]sans-culottism[/i]'. She makes sure to pronounce that in the most Parisian accent possible."

Rule for listing exits while looking in Webster Court:
	say "The streets continue south, east, and west; and just to the northeast is my parents['] side garden."


Check waving the letter-remover at the statue of Noah Webster when the current setting of the letter-remover is "u":

A description-concealing rule when the location is not Webster Court:
	now the statue of Noah Webster is not marked for listing.

Instead of examining the statue of Noah Webster when the player is not in Webster Court:

The introduction is "I think I mentioned that my parents were well off. My father works for the Bureau, embarrassingly, and my mother was born into the kind of money that we like to pretend doesn't exist on this island."
	The description is "It's stucco and tile, inspired by southern California ideas of gracious living. There are potted palm trees inside, and leather sofas, and French oil paintings for which expensive importation lic[ense]s had to be bought.

My childhood bedroom faces northwest, away from the docks, towards the roofs of other villas and the open sea."


The pink door is north of Webster Court and south of Foyer. The pink door is a door. The pink door is scenery. It is lockable and locked.

Foyer is indoors.

Parental appearance is a scene. Parental appearance begins when the location is webster court and Patriotic chard-garden is visited and Private Beach is visited.

	move fake-father to the location;
	say "The door to my parents['] house opens and my father comes out. He's talking over his shoulder: 'Sorry, dear, but [i]someone[/i] has to be on call.'

My mother answers from inside, but we can't make out what she's saying.

'Surge on the grid,' Father replies. 'Could be an unauthor[ize]d synthes[ize]r, but more likely... yes, exactly. I'll try to be home before the fireworks.'

He closes the door behind him.";

		try taking off the monocle;
		if the player encloses the backpack:

				try opening the backpack;
			if the backpack is open:
				try inserting the monocle into the backpack;

Report taking off the monocle in the presence of fake-father:

Serial Comma Day is supposed to be a day off, even for him." The initial appearance is  "My father is just outside [my home]. He's clipping the cuffs of his trousers so that he won't snag them on anything during his ride in to work. His scooter is propped against the [statue of Noah Webster], ready for action."

After writing a paragraph about fake-father:
	set pronouns from fake-father.

Sanity-check doing something other than acting fast during parental appearance:
	[I don't know how this worked in 6G60, or what changed. Now the behavior at least matches that version.]
	if the current action is the action of listing exits:

Parental appearance ends when turn-taken is true.

Turn-taken is a truth state that varies. Before reading a command during parental appearance: now turn-taken is true.

Rule for listing exits while looking during parental appearance:

	say "[if the prior named object is fake-father]He[otherwise]My father[end if] sees us from a distance and gives a neighb[our]ly wave. 'Happy Punctuating!' he shouts.

I wave back rather weakly.

He gets on his [if not looking]small red [end if]scooter, checks his helmet, and revs off to the south. Off, apparently, to investigate the synthes[ize]r that put us together. That will go slowly because of the holiday, but I'm guessing there will be Bureau investigators crawling all over the south side of old town in an hour or two."

Instead of doing something to the pink door:
	say "Walking into my parents['] house is the action perhaps most likely to get us caught."

Rule for printing the name of the pink door:
	if the the pink door is marked-visible, say "door here";

Section 3 - Chard-Garden

The Patriotic Chard-Garden is northeast of Webster Court. Understand "patriotic garden" or "chard garden" as the patriotic chard-garden.
	The description is "A narrow strip of land between the house and the edge of my parents['] property. The eastern edge runs right up to the [decaying old wall] of the city, which here means some stumpy masonry on this side and a dizzying drop on the other.

The rest of their terraces and gardens are fenced off."
	The introduction is "Because it's so linguistically productive, chard is something of a national symbol; and during the world wars, there was a fad of gardening at home. After the war, it became common for affluent people with a little bit of land to keep their garden, so that if you were down on your luck you could glean a few leaves."

The decaying old wall is scenery in Patriotic Chard-Garden. The description is "This part of it is not really picturesque: just old rocks, a few of which occasionally shift loose and fall away."

Instead of climbing the decaying old wall:
	say "It's not in the best of shape. It wouldn't be hard to become part of a minor rockfall and kill ourselves on the descent."

A chard is in Patriotic Chard-Garden. It is a vegetable. The initial appearance is "A little [chard] still grows in the nearest bed, carefully tended to thrive in this climate." The indefinite article of the chard is "some".

Instead of taking the chard when the chard is not handled and the location is the Patriotic Chard-Garden:
	say "We pick the chard, leaving bare soil behind.

A flicker of curtains from inside the house suggests that someone saw us [--] a cleaner, possibly. But then there is a voice, not audible except as a confident rising and falling tone; this will be my mother, saying not to worry and not to interfere.";
	move the chard to the player.

A soil is a fixed in place thing in the Patriotic Chard-Garden. The indefinite article is "some". The initial appearance is "At our feet is a patch of [soil]."

	say "It's more than [we] can carry around by the handful."

[Every turn when the player carries the dirt:
	move the dirt to the location;
	say "The dirt is more than we can contain, and spills out onto the ground instead." ]

Before doing something when the current action involves the soil and the chard is in the location:
	say "The soil is hard to see under the chard." instead.

A description-concealing rule when the soil is marked for listing:
	if the chard is in the location, now the soil is not marked for listing.

Understand "school" or "elementary" or "building" or "big" or "arched" or "windows" or "faded" or "floorboards" or "yard" or "schoolyard" as the schoolhouse. The description is "[one of]It's where I went to school until I was twelve, as did most of the kids in this area. It's an old building with big arched windows and faded floorboards, and in the afternoon the schoolyard smells of spilled milk going sour in the sun. [or][stopping]From this direction there's not much to see but the screen of palm trees in front."

Some handsome old houses are a backdrop. They are in Hesychius Street and Roget Close. They are scenery. They screen south. The description is "Many of them built in the mid- or late 19th century, the houses are designed for families with a number of servants. Some of the owners even continue to keep up establishments on that scale." Understand "villas" as the handsome old houses.

Some palm trees are scenery in Roget Close. Understand "screen" or "palms" as the palm trees. The description is "They aren't the very tall and graceful kind, but a stumpier variety, forming a sort of vegetative colonnade in front of the school building[if the gum is in the location and the gum is not handled]. There's some [gum] stuck to the base of the nearest tree[end if]."

Instead of climbing palm trees:
	say "Were you good at pole climbing exercises in gym? Because I wasn't."

[Because it requires several levels of examination, it's likely that many players will miss the gum entirely -- which is fine, because there are several other, more prominent solutions to the spinner puzzle. The aim here is to provide a reward to people whose first instinct is deep rather than broad exploration when they're faced with a new puzzle.

Once they *have* seen the gum, it becomes more prominently visible in the room description to hint that they could interact with it if they want.]

The gum is in Roget Close. It is edible. The heft of the gum is 1. The indefinite article is "some". The initial appearance is "Gum adheres to one of the palm trees, left no doubt by some departing school kid."

Sanity-check eating the gum:
	say "I'm afraid I've never cared for ABC gum." instead.

Sanity-check tasting the gum:
	say "I'm afraid I've never cared for ABC gum." instead.

A description-concealing rule when the gum is marked for listing:
	if the gum is not handled and the gum is not seen:
		now the gum is not marked for listing.

Test gum with "tutorial off / look / x school / x palm / look / x gum / get gum / look / x palm trees / chew gum / eat gum / drop gum  / look / get gum / put gum on spinner / get mug / x mug / wave g-remover at mug / n" in Roget Close.

	increase path description count by 1;
	say "[if N is greater than 0]There [we][otherwise][We][end if] slip between the houses and down a path that looks as though it might lead to someone's back yard. No one has ever put up signage to correct this misapprehension because no one who lives around here is eager to encourage strangers on the private beach.

Soon, however, the footpath begins to descend purposefully towards the level of the ocean[if the location is the final destination].[otherwise].[paragraph break][end if]";
	continue the action;

Section 5 - Winding Footpath

The spinner-gate is north of Roget Close.  It is a closed transparent locked door. The printed name of the spinner-gate is "gate". Understand "gate" as the spinner-gate. The initial appearance is "If you look just north between the houses, you'll notice also the footpath down to an almost-private beach. It used to be open, but it's now gated off, and built into the [spinner-gate] is a chic modern sculpture."

The description of the spinner-gate is "A gate of wrought iron bars between two sturdy columns[if the spinner-gate is closed and the spinner-gate is locked], too close to climb through and too tall to climb over[else if the spinner-gate is closed], closed but not locked[else if the spinner-gate is open]; at the moment the gate has been pushed conveniently open[end if]. Built into the right-hand column, next to the gate latch, is a curious sculpture."

Out-direction of Winding Footpath is south. [Through the spinner gate]

Through spinner-gate is the Winding Footpath. South of Winding Footpath is Roget Close.

Winding Footpath is an outdoors room. The description is "The [underfoot-path] winds between the villas, sloping steeply downward. It is narrow, and [bushes] left and right conceal it even from the windows of the people living nearby." Understand "path" as Winding Footpath.

Instead of going down in Winding Footpath:
	try going north.

Instead of going up in Winding Footpath:
	try going south.

Report facing in Winding Footpath:

Some bushes are scenery in Winding Footpath. The description is "Some variety I'm not familiar with: dark glossy green leaves, thick stems. In the right season, and I can't even remember what season that is, they also grow gaudy pink flowers. But not now[if kudzu is part of the bushes]. Lots of [kudzu] grows through and over the bushes [--] this is one of the few spots on the island where it hasn't been eradicated, it seems[end if].

[if the bushes are shrine-hiding]At one point along the path the bushes stick out especially far, as though there's something behind them.[otherwise]The bushes part a little to reveal the [shrine] [we] found.[end if]". Understand "dark" or "glossy" or "green" or "leaves" or "gaudy" or "pink" as the bushes.

The kudzu is part of the bushes. The indefinite article is "some". Understand "invasive" or "vines" or "vine" as the kudzu. The description of the kudzu is "An invasive vine grown through and over the bushes."

Test foilkudzubug with "cut kudzu with foil" holding the foil in the Winding Footpath.

Carry out cutting the kudzu with something:
	now the kudzu is nowhere.

Report cutting the kudzu with the jigsaw:
	say "The jigsaw is not an ideal tool for kudzu removal and [we] wind up making a bit of a mess with bits of bush, but we do enough damage to clear the stage a bit." instead.

Report cutting the kudzu with the sword:
	say "A sword is not a machete, a fact that [we] have reason to ponder at some length. At least it's not a heavy broadsword. Our arm is not nearly strong enough to wield one of those. Even this blade gets tiring to wield surprisingly quickly.

After a long time and a lot of bother, [we] manage to lop off the main kudzu bits." instead.


The bushes can be shrine-hiding or shrine-revealing. The bushes are shrine-hiding.

Setting action variables for searching or looking under the kudzu:
	now the noun is the bushes.

Instead of searching or looking under the bushes:
	if the kudzu is part of the bushes:
		say "It's hard to get a good look under the bushes with all this kudzu in the way." instead;
	if the bushes are shrine-hiding:
		say "Hunting behind the bushes reveals something I vaguely remember seeing when I was a child, but not noticing again since: built into the wall is what looks like a very ancient sort of shrine.";
		now the bushes are shrine-revealing;
	otherwise:
		say "There's nothing more to find, really."

Instead of waving the letter-remover at the shrine:
	say "It won't do any good, you see: this is an [if the player is wearing britishizing goggles]artefact[otherwise]artifact[end if] of another time and language, and it has never been neutral[ize]d by authorities, so it won't respond to English-language tools. Quite likely it's in a language so old that it can't be manipulated at all.

I wonder why it hasn't been removed, or fixed; but I'd guess the reason is that very few people come this way."

Instead of waving the letter-remover at something which is part of the shrine:
	try waving the letter-remover at the shrine.

A description-concealing rule:
	if the bushes are shrine-hiding:
		now the shrine is not marked for listing.

Instead of pushing or pulling or turning the shrine:
	say "The backing stone is built firmly into the wall."

Sanity-check doing something when the bushes are shrine-hiding:
	if the noun is the shrine or the second noun is the shrine:
		say "Now that you mention it, I do vaguely recall something about a shrine in this area, but [we] can't make it out under the [bushes] right now." instead.

[The nymph 'shrine' is nod to the island's Roman history. There's nothing in the game to reveal this, really, but the idea is that this stone is actually a panel from an imperial-era sarcophagus (nymphs were often featured on such panels, and sarcophagus carvers were of very varied levels of skill). Subsequent inhabitants moved it.]

The shrine is a fixed in place container in the Winding Footpath. The initial appearance is "Now that the bushes have been cleared a little, the ancient shrine is plainly visible[if the shrine is non-empty], and [a random thing in the shrine] [are] set up in the place of hon[our][end if]." Understand "ancient" or "wall" or "niche" or "stone" or "backing" as the shrine. The description of the shrine is "There's a niche dug into the stone of the wall, above a [low relief] of three ladies. It's not very good work to start with, and has been eroded by a lot of weather, and I wouldn't be surprised if this weren't its original location; it probably stood somewhere else and was brought here.".

The carrying capacity of the shrine is 1.

Sanity-check inserting something into the shrine:
	if the heft of the noun is greater than 2:
		say "[The noun] [are] too large to fit in the shrine niche." instead.

Sanity-check putting something on the shrine:
	try inserting the noun into the shrine instead.

[The shrine is an easter egg to begin with; but easter eggs are the most fun if they are toys as well. The shrine offers the opportunity for some expressive play, as the player can try inserting different items. Mostly it's up to the player to roll his own meanings for this, but there are special responses for a few of the most pointed donations.]

Report inserting an as into the shrine:
	say "[We] set [the noun] in the shrine, as though to leave a small offering for whatever deities these were." instead.

Report inserting the member into the shrine:
	say "[We] plant [the noun] in the shrine, where it looks pedantic and pin-headed. What is the point of its obsession about punctuation and spelling, in the broader scope of things?" instead.

Report inserting the members into the shrine:
	say "The set of members just barely fits into the shrine. They look odd and plastic against the rough stone." instead.

Report inserting the army into the shrine:
	say "The figures of the soldiers form a neat line in the shrine niche. It looks as though a child had come here to play." instead.

Report inserting the cross into the shrine:
	say "[We] appropriate the ancient pagan shrine for a more Christian purpose, as many others must have done here when Atlantis was first converted in the fourth century." instead.

Report inserting the Guidebook into the shrine:
	say "[We] set [the noun] down in the niche. A pointed gesture, that: this shrine is just one of the many things around the island that the [i]Guidebook[/i] does not, and cannot, acknowledge." instead.

Report inserting a pi-object into the shrine:
	say "[We] set [the noun] in the niche, where it gleams in crisp and perfect contrast to the old and battered superstitious monument. Pure and eternal mathematics, exalted by the frail hand of man; or something like that." instead.

Report inserting the roll of bills into the shrine:
	say "[We] set up a cult to cash and contemplate it for a minute. There's no one else around to appreciate the point, though, and we need the money, so it will have to be a temporary installation only." instead.

Report inserting a sin into the shrine:
	say "[We] arrange [the noun] in the shrine niche, as some sort of ironic statement about what people worship these days." instead.

Report inserting the dog into the shrine:
	say "[We] stick the dog into the shrine niche. The effect is a bit sinister." instead.

Report inserting the god into the shrine:
	say "[We] stand the god up in the niche in a place of solemn hon[our]. It fits perfectly, as though shaped for just this use.

For a moment, with the air still and hot, and no one visible in any direction, we might almost believe that the past two millennia have been nothing, and that the shrine is fresh and new.

But Anglophone Atlantis prefers to forget what it was.";
	record "Jocasta Higgate award for reconstructing pagan worship on the island" as an achievement instead.

Report inserting something into the shrine:
	say "[We] give [the noun] a place of solemn hon[our] above the relief of frolicking ladies." instead.

The low relief is a part of the shrine. Understand "ladies" or "three" or "waves" or "surface" or "nymph" or "nymphs" or "bare" or "breasts" or "breast" or "garment" or "garments" or "carving" or "sculpture" or "sculpted" as the low relief.  The description is "It looks like three ladies dancing on the surface of waves. They're probably meant to be nymphs, if I had to guess. They have bare breasts and fluttering garments, but the carving was done by someone who has not the slightest idea how to make limbs appear under sculpted cloth, so it all looks clunky, as though they don't have hips or legs at all, just randomly swirling skirts as their lower halves.

All the same, there's something appealing about it."

After going from the Winding Footpath to the Private Beach:
	let N be the number of entries in the path so far of the player;
	if N is greater than 1:
		say "[path-walked so far]";
	otherwise if N is 1:
		clear path-walked for player;
	increase path description count by 1;
	say "[We] continue down until there is a chink of a view of the sea. Then the path descends through a few last hairpin twists among rocks, and comes out suddenly on a little beach[if N is greater than 1].[paragraph break][otherwise if N is 1].[otherwise].[end if]";
	continue the action.

Test pathbug with "wear monocle / x path" holding the monocle in Winding Footpath.

underfoot-path is a privately-named improper-named scenery thing in Winding Footpath. The printed name is "footpath". Understand "path" or "footpath" or "pathway" as underfoot-path. The description is "There are traces of sand on the pathway, tracked up from the beach."

Instead of climbing underfoot-path:
	try going south.

Section 6 - The Beach

Private Beach is north of Winding Footpath. The description is "This is little more than a strip of fine yellow [sand], perhaps twenty me[ter]s from side to side, and five from the [hillside] to the waterline[if the sage is in the location and the sage is not handled]. A little [sage] grows on the hillside, escaped from some garden, along with wilder plants[end if]. Above, at the top of that slope, are houses with balconies overlooking the sea, but from this angle it's impossible to see much of them, or for them (you'll have to take my word on this) to see us[if high street is visited and roundabout is not visited].

It's tempting to look for crabs among the rocks, but the tide is high just now, and even at the best of times this is not an area rich in sealife[end if]."

Understand "look for crabs" or "search for crabs" or "find crabs" or "catch crabs" as a mistake ("There aren't likely to be any, is the point.") when the player is in Private Beach.

The hillside is a facade in Private Beach. It is scenery. It fronts west. The initial appearance is "The [hillside] both east and west runs steeply down into the water [--] much too steep to allow for beaches or buildings. Here and there some bit of plant life has managed to cling onto the rock, but mostly it is bare and rough." Understand "hill" or "slope" or "plant life" or "plants" as the hillside.

Building is an action applying to one thing.

Check building:
	if the sandcastle is built:
		say "There isn't time to build an entire sand-city." instead.

Carry out building:
	let N be a random number between 3 and 10;
	sandcastle washes away in N turns from now;
	now the sandcastle is built.

Report building:
	say "It would be madness to spend long on such projects when [we] have so much else to be doing, but [we] do, for old times['] sake (mine, at least), construct a couple of hasty cylindrical turrets and a protective wall of sorts."

Instead of taking the sand:
	say "Sure, [we] could wander off with a handful of sand, but [we] could hardly shift any significant portion of the beach. And then we'd be making a mess and dribbling sand grains everywhere."

Test funnelbug with "tutorial off / hard / y / dig / dig sand" in the Beach.

After digging in the sand when the funnel is buried:
	now the funnel is not buried;
