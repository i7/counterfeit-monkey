Version 6 of Smarter Parser (for Glulx only) by Aaron Reed begins here.

"Understands a broader range of input than the standard parser, and can direct new players towards proper syntax."

[
CHANGES:
 -- Version 6: Major revision. Altered visual style to be more refined and more flexible; named rulebook outcomes; renamed and clarified several variables; rewrote documentation; added a few new cases from newbie Sand-dancer transcripts; stopped trying to strip single quotes from input (this was a bug that led to problems with recognizing possessives like "grandma's"; Poor Man's Mistype would catch attempts to say "grandmas" anyway.) Marked as glulx only due to issues with z-machine compilation. Cleaned up some formatting issues, including an occasional erroneous first space.
 -- Version 5: Removed deprecated features; added option to ignore all rules; adjusted responses to not have fantasy RPG elements & use more examples taken from the player's current environment.
 -- Version 4: Updated for build 6E59
 -- Version 3: added ? for help, more punctuation removal; corrected a typo; minor bug fixes.
 -- Version 2: bug fixes.

Chapter - Definitions

Use MAX_EXPRESSION_NODES of 300.

The reborn command is an indexed text that varies. The rejected command is an indexed text that varies. 

Suppress parser error is a truth state that varies. sp reparse flag is a truth state that varies.

Smarter Parser is a rulebook. The Smarter Parser rules have outcomes reparse the command (success), reject the command (failure), and no match (no outcome).

Chapter - Empty Smarter Parser Rulebook

Use empty Smarter Parser rulebook translates as (- Constant NO_SMARTER_PARSER_RULES; -).

To decide whether sp_normal: if the empty Smarter Parser rulebook option is active, no; yes.

Section - Cleaning Up Punctuation

After reading a command (this is the Smarter Parser simplify punctuation rule):
	let tmpcmd be indexed text;
	now tmpcmd is the player's command;
	if tmpcmd exactly matches the text "?", now tmpcmd is "help";
	replace the regular expression "<;:!?>" in tmpcmd with ". "; [new players have sometimes tried to seperate commands using these punctuation marks.]
	replace the regular expression "<\\\/()\{\}[quotation mark][bracket][close bracket]>" in tmpcmd with " ";
	if the number of characters in tmpcmd is 0, now tmpcmd is "."; [To fix a bug where in certain cases an empty command causes the word/character counts to break]
	change the text of the player's command to tmpcmd.


Section - Try Harder to Understand


Before printing a parser error (this is the Smarter Parser trying harder to understand rule):
	now the rejected command is the player's command;
	now the reborn command is the player's command; 
	follow the Smarter Parser rules;
	if the outcome of the rulebook is the reparse the command outcome:
		if reborn command is not rejected command:
			clean up the reparsed command;
			announce the reparsed command;
			now sp reparse flag is true;
	otherwise if the outcome of the rulebook is the reject the command outcome:
		now suppress parser error is true;
		explain the reborn command.

Rule for printing a parser error when suppress parser error is true or sp reparse flag is true (this is the Smarter Parser suppress parser messages on matches rule):
	now suppress parser error is false.

Rule for reading a command when sp reparse flag is true (this is the Smarter Parser retrying input rule):
	now sp reparse flag is false;
	change the text of the player's command to the substituted form of "[reborn command]".

Section - Explaining Results

To announce the reparsed command:
	say "[unless saved Smarter Parser error is empty]([italic type][saved Smarter Parser error][roman type])[command clarification break][end unless]>[reborn command in upper case]".

To explain the reborn command:
	say "[italic type][saved Smarter Parser error][roman type][line break]". 

To clean up the reparsed command:
	while character number 1 in reborn command is " ":
		replace character number 1 in reborn command with "";
	replace the regular expression " {2,}" in reborn command with " ".


Section - Macros for defining rules

To decide whether stripping (regex - an indexed text) is fruitful, even within words:
	let original be the reborn command;
	if even within words:
		replace the regular expression "[regex]" in reborn command with "";
	otherwise:
		replace the regular expression "\b[regex]\b" in reborn command with "";
	if original is not reborn command:
		decide yes;
	now reborn command is original;
	decide no.

To decide whether input starts with (regex - an indexed text), even within words:
	if even within words:
		if reborn command exactly matches the regular expression "^[regex].*":
			decide yes;
	otherwise:
		if reborn command exactly matches the regular expression "^[regex]\b.*":
			decide yes;
	decide no.

To decide whether input ends with (regex - an indexed text), even within words:
	if even within words:
		if reborn command exactly matches the regular expression ".*[regex]$":
			decide yes;
	otherwise:
		if reborn command exactly matches the regular expression ".*\b[regex]$":
			decide yes;
	decide no.

To decide whether input contains (regex - an indexed text), even within words:
	if even within words:
		if reborn command matches the regular expression "[regex]":
			decide yes;
	otherwise: 
		if reborn command matches the regular expression "\b[regex]\b":
			decide yes;
	decide no.

Chapter - Printing Results

Section - The Print Rule

The saved Smarter Parser error is a text variable.

To identify error as (why - a rule):
	if sp-debug is true, say "(smart parser debug: printing message for [why])[command clarification break]";
	if there is a SP rule of why in Table of Smarter Parser Messages:
		choose row with a SP rule of why in Table of Smarter Parser Messages;
		now saved Smarter Parser error is substituted form of "[message entry]";
	otherwise:
		now saved Smarter Parser error is "".

Section - Applicable Examples

[These two say statements are currently neutered because of a bug in nested indexed text handling under Glulx in 6E72.]

To say get noun example: [say "FLOWER, for example".]
	let noun_example be text;
	if the number of visible things > 0:
		now noun_example is "[random marked-visible thing]";
	otherwise:
		now noun_example is "flower";
	say "[noun_example in upper case]".

To say get direction example: [say "NORTH, for example".]
	let randdir be a random sp_viable direction;
	let dir_example be text;
	if randdir is a direction:
		now dir_example is "[randdir]";
		say "[dir_example in upper case], for example";
	otherwise:
		say "NORTH, for example".
		
Definition: a direction is sp_viable if the room it from location is a room.

Chapter - Testing - For Testing Only

Understand "parser" as parser-debugging. Parser-debugging is an action out of world applying to nothing.

SP-debug is a truth state that varies.

Carry out parser-debugging:
	if sp-debug is true:
		now sp-debug is false;
		say "Smart Parser debugging off.";
	otherwise:
		now sp-debug is true;
		say "Smart Parser debugging on."


Smarter Parser ends here.

---- DOCUMENTATION ----


Section: Introduction


Some newcomers to IF are put off by the traditional parser, which offers no default instruction, is fairly rigid about the type of input it will accept, and does not usually phrase error messages in an instructional manner. After one or two confusing error messages, many new players will just give up.

This extension responds to various common forms of misunderstood input tried by new players, offering more helpful responses or reparsing certain commands in a more standard form. It also is easy to extend with your own matched patterns.

The easiest way to use the extension is to just include it; nothing else is necessary. Further reading is only necessary if you wish to customize the behavior.

A few notes: This extension owes a lot conceptually to Emily Short's Inform 6 extension, NewbieGrammar.h, and is also to a large degree a response to its author's experience with new player transcripts (see http://aaronareed.net/wttc/transcripts.html). While the extension is marked for Glulx only, it's technically possible to compile a .z8 story using it, although you won't have a lot of headroom left for story.


Section: Existing Rules


A new rulebook, the smarter parser rules, is run just before printing a parser error message. Each rule looks for a specific type of input pattern, and if it finds one, can print a better error message, or even adjust or replace the command and try running it again.

Running the rulebook at the end of the turn cycle rather than the beginning means that nothing in this extension should conflict with game-specific code. If you define your own "what is" command, for instance, it will be parsed and dealt with before Smarter Parser has a chance to kick in.

Here is the default rule set, in order, along with an example of the type of malformed command each is designed to catch. Most of these rules can understand a wide range of similar input. 

	the standardize apostrophes rule
	the scandalous standardize swears rule
	the signs of confusion rule
		">I don't know what to do"
	the stripping niceties rule
		">please take the sword"
	the stripping interjections rule
		">take the damn sword"
	the signs of frustration rule
		">this game sucks"
	the too many words rule
	the standardize be verbs rule
	the asking who are you rule
		">who am I talking to "
	the asking who am i rule
		">who am i"
	the asking where am i rule
		">where am i"
	the asking unparseable questions rule
		">why is this sword here"
	the stripping verbose intro rule
		">I want to get the sword"
	the making assertions rule
		">I am strong"
	the starting command with i rule
		">I love this game"
	the stripping adverbs rule	
		">go north carefully"
	the unnecessary movement rule
		">go to sword"
	the stripping vague words rule
		">go somewhere"
	the stripping pointless words rule
		">anyway kill the troll"
	the stripping failed with rule	
		">kill goblin with a rock"
	the generic surroundings rule	
		">look at ground"
	the stripping body parts rule	
		">take woman's hand"
	the stripping unnecessary addendum rule
		">wait for a while"

(The standardize apostrophes rule converts contractions like "I'm" to "I am", then strips any remaining apostrophes; the "standardize be verbs" replaces am, was, were, and so on with "_be". Later rules can use this tag to simplify pattern matching.)

Section: Reparsing

The rules beginning with "stripping" attempt to remove the offending part of the command and try again: >PLEASE TAKE THE SWORD is tried as >TAKE THE SWORD. When this happens, the player is notified. A named phrase controls the style of notification. By default, it looks like this:

	To announce the reparsed command:
		say "[unless saved Smarter Parser error is empty]([italic type][saved Smarter Parser error][roman type])[command clarification break][end unless]>[reborn command in upper case]".

You can create your own custom style of notification by simply rewriting this named phrase in your own code, making use of the variables "saved Smarter Parser error" and "reborn command":

	To announce the reparsed command:
		say "(retrying that as '[reborn command]')[command clarification break]".

Section: Rejecting More Helpfully

All other Smarter Parser rules look for certain patterns in misunderstood input and display a message explaining why the command wasn't understood and offering suggestions for a better command to try. The named phrase that controls this is:

	To explain the reborn command:
		say "[italic type][saved Smarter Parser error][roman type][line break]".

Again, you can override this by re-declaring the phrase.

The error message for a smarter parser rule can be changed by amending the Table of Smarter Parser Messages, like so:

	Table of Smarter Parser Messages (amended)
	SP rule						message
	the stripping niceties rule		"Your fawning attitude sickens me."

These messages can make use of the phrases [get noun example], to print the name of a visible thing, or [get direction example] to print a direction that can be moved in. (*Note: these currently produce preset alternatives, due to a bug in Inform 6E72.)

Type "parser" in an unreleased game to see which rule is generating a particular message.

If you don't like a rule, you can get rid of it with standard rule ordering syntax:

	The stripping niceties rule is not listed in the smarter parser rulebook.

You can also remove all of the built-in rules by adding the use option:

	Use empty Smarter Parser rulebook.



Section: Making new Smarter Parser Rules


To create your own Smarter Parser rules, you'll need to understand regular expressions: see the "Advanced Text" chapter of the Inform docs for a basic introduction.

Here's an example of how to write a new Smarter Parser rule that removes a pattern and tries the command again:

	A smarter parser rule (this is the stripping formal address rule):
		if stripping "(sir|ma'am)" is fruitful:
			identify error as stripping formal address rule;
			reparse the command.

The condition "if stripping (some text) is fruitful" will be true if the text was found and successfully removed from the player's command. You must then "identify error as (the name of the rule)" and either "reparse the command" (to try it again) or "reject the command" (to give up). If you do neither, the next smarter parser rule will be checked. If no smarter parser rules match, Inform's default parser error printing system will kick in.

In addition to stripping text, you can also try matching:

	A smarter parser rule (this is the no leet speak allowed rule):
		if input contains "\w\d+\w":
			identify error as no leet speak allowed rule;
			reject the command.

"if input contains (a regular expression)" will be true if the given expression appears as its own word or set of words in the rejected command. You can also test the conditions "if input starts with" or "if input ends with." To any of these you can add the phrase option ", even within words" to match more broadly.

If we want to set the reparsed command by hand, we can directly adjust the variable "the reborn command."

You should define the text printed when a new smarter parser rule matches by continuing the Table of Smarter Parser Messages. (If there is no matching entry, nothing will be printed when this rule matches, which is sometimes what you want for very minor corrections.)

	Table of Smarter Parser Messages (continued)
	SP rule						message
	no leet speak allowed rule	"This story requires you to use proper spelling and grammar."

Note that rules are tried in the order listed. "asking who am i," which would match the command >WHO AM I, needs to come before "asking unparseable questions," which matches the pattern "who (any text)". If the order were reversed, "asking who am i" would never be run. In general, more specific rules involving the same words should come before more general rules.

A final note: checking regular expressions causes a certain performance hit, so the more rules you add, the slower things will be. The slowdown only happens when the player types misunderstood input, but keep in mind this might be rather frequent for new players, many of whom may be playing your story on a slow interpreter such as Quixe for the web.



Example: * Caverns and Kobolds - A tiny scenario to test misunderstood input with.

	*: "Caverns and Kobolds"

	Include Smarter Parser by Aaron Reed.

	Spooky Cave is a room. A glowing sword is in Spooky Cave. Dark Tunnel is north of Spooky Cave. A dusty skull is in Dark Tunnel.

	A smarter parser rule (this is the no leet speak allowed rule):
		if input contains "\w\d+\w":
			identify error as no leet speak allowed rule;
			reject the command.

	A smarter parser rule (this is the stripping formal address rule):
		if stripping "(sir|maam)" is fruitful:
			identify error as stripping formal address rule;
			reparse the command.

	The stripping formal address rule is listed first in the smarter parser rules.

	Table of Smarter Parser Messages (continued)
	SP rule			message
	no leet speak allowed rule		"This game requires you to use proper spelling and grammar."
	stripping formal address rule		"I appreciate your respect, but all you need to do is type your commands directly."
	
	Test me with "ub4r l33t / what do I do then?? / who am i? / who are you / where am I!? / go to sword / please take the sword sir / this is stupid / drop the damned sword / why is the sky blue / I want to take the sword / go somewhere / carefully go north / anyway look around / touch ceiling / touch skull with my foot / scratch head / wait for a while / I like this game after all".
