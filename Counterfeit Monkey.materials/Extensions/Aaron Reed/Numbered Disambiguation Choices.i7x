Version 2 of Numbered Disambiguation Choices by Aaron Reed begins here."Numbers the options in disambiguation questions, to help new players and solve the 'disambiguation loop' problem caused by indistinguishable objects."Every thing has a number called disambiguation id. The disambiguation id of something is usually 0.   The list of disambiguables is a list of objects that varies.

disambiguation-busy is a truth state that varies. disambiguation-busy is false. [In certain cases numbers could be printed twice. Thanks to Robert Jenkins for pointing this out.]
Before printing the name of something (called macguffin) while asking which do you mean (this is the preface disambiguation objects with numbers rule):
	if disambiguation-busy is false:
		now disambiguation-busy is true;		add macguffin to the list of disambiguables, if absent;		now the disambiguation id of macguffin is the number of entries in list of disambiguables;		say "[before disambiguation number text][number of entries in list of disambiguables][after disambiguation number text]".

After printing the name of something while asking which do you mean (this is the cleanup disambiguation-busy flag rule):
	now disambiguation-busy is false.
The before disambiguation number text is some text that varies. The before disambiguation number text is "". The after disambiguation number text is some text that varies. The after disambiguation number text is ") ". 		Before asking which do you mean (this is the reset disambiguables rule):	repeat with item running through list of disambiguables:		now disambiguation id of item is 0;	truncate list of disambiguables to 0 entries.		Understand the disambiguation id property as describing a thing.[In testing, some players would try to respond with something like "1) dog collar". If we replace closing parentheses from the input with a space, this can still be understood, rather than producing an unhelpful error.]After reading a command (this is the strip closing parenthesis rule):	let disam-cmd be indexed text;	let disam-cmd be the player's command;	replace the regular expression "\)" in disam-cmd with " ";	change the text of the player's command to disam-cmd.Numbered Disambiguation Choices ends here.---- DOCUMENTATION ----This extension is designed to solve two problems with disambiguation questions. First: many newcomers to IF do not realize that they can just type an identifying word to answer the question, causing frustration as they retype their whole command all over again each time this occurs. Second, it's all too easy for a disambiguation question to be triggered that does not provide enough information to differentiate between the two items-- either the author did not supply enough adjectives, or the adjectives are not part of the way the object names are printed. In either case this leads to the dreaded "disambiguation loop," where the question keeps repeating and one or more of the objects cannot be referred to at all.Numbered Disambiguation Choices addresses both issues by printing (and then understanding) numbers before each object in a disambiguation question. Players can type just the number (or an identifying word or new command, as normal) to continue.By default, the extension will not reset the numbers until another disambiguation question is asked. This is because in testing players would often try to refer to other objects in the disambiguation list by their number in subsequent turns. If you want to change this so numbers can only be used immediately after a disambiguation question is asked, add the following to your code:	Every turn: follow the reset disambiguables rule.A final note: if your code involves parsing the closing parenthesis character -- ) -- you'll need to remove or overrule the "strip closing parenthesis rule". By default, the extension removes this character from input, since some players try to be too literal when answering the disambiguation question.Example: * Curio Shop - A setting littered with opportunities for confused input.	*: "Curio Shop".	Include Numbered Disambiguation Choices by Aaron Reed.	The Curio Shop is a room.    	A dog is an animal in Curio Shop. A cast iron hot dog, a hot plate, a hot iron, a dog collar, a copy of Dog Fancier magazine, and a 16mm film are in Curio Shop. A 16mm film canister is in Curio Shop.	Test me with "x dog / 1 / x hot / x dog / 2 / x 3 / take film / 1) 16mm film".Normally, players would never be able to refer to the dog or the 16mm film, since no adjectives are defined that could distinguish them from the dog collar or the 16mm film canister. Though a somewhat contrived example here, this situation is all too easy for authors to accidentally create.
