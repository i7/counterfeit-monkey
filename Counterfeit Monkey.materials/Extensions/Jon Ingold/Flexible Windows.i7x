Version 15/161003 of Flexible Windows (for Glulx only) by Jon Ingold begins here.

"Exposes the Glk windows system so authors can completely control the creation and use of windows"

[ Flexible Windows was originally by Jon Ingold, with many contributions by Erik Temple. This version has been essentially rewritten from scratch for 6L38 by Dannii Willis. ]

[ Migration guide from version 14:
- Many kinds, properties and the main/status windows have lost their hyphens
- Colours/styles updated to match GTE
- The window-drawing rules have been turned into the refreshing activity. It is no longer necessary to focus or clear the window
- Hyperlink-related code has been removed entirely.

Section - Interpreter Sniffing (for use with Interpreter Sniffing by Friends of I7)

[ Because we hack the glk_window_open() function, we must delay the resniffing rules until after the initialise memory rule ]
The resniffing stage rule is not listed in the startup rules.
Before starting the virtual machine (this is the alternate resniffing stage rule):

Chapter - The g-window kind

[ g-windows must be a kind of container in order to use the containment relation as the spawning relation. Be careful if you iterate through all containers! ]
A g-window is a kind of container.
The specification of a g-window is "Models the Glk window system."

A g-window type is a kind of value.
The g-window types are g-text-buffer, g-text-grid and g-graphics.
The specification of a g-window type is "Glk windows are one of these three types."
A g-window has a g-window type called type.
Definition: a g-window is graphical rather than textual if the type of it is g-graphics.
Definition: a g-window is buffering rather than non-buffering if the type of it is g-text-buffer.

A graphics g-window is a kind of g-window.
The type of a graphics g-window is g-graphics.
A text buffer g-window is a kind of g-window.
The type of a text buffer g-window is g-text-buffer.
A text grid g-window is a kind of g-window.
The type of a text grid g-window is g-text-grid.

A g-window position is a kind of value.
The g-window positions are g-placenull, g-placeleft, g-placeright, g-placeabove and g-placebelow.
The specification of a g-window position is "Specifies which direction a window will be split off from its parent window."
A g-window has a g-window position called position.
Definition: a g-window is vertically positioned rather than horizontally positioned if the position of it is at least g-placeabove.

A g-window scale method is a kind of value.
The g-window scale methods are g-proportional, g-fixed-size.
The specification of a g-window scale method is "Specifies whether the measurement should be taken as an absolute value or a percentage of the parent window."
A g-window has a g-window scale method called scale method.

A g-window has a number called measurement.
The measurement of a g-window is usually 40.

A g-window has a number called minimum size.
A g-window has a number called maximum size.

A g-window has a number called the rock number.

A g-window has a number called ref number.

A g-window can be g-required or g-unrequired.
A g-window is usually g-unrequired.

A g-window can be g-present or g-unpresent.
A g-window is usually g-unpresent.



Chapter - The spawning relation

[ The most efficient relations use the object tree. Inform will only use the object tree for a few built in relations however, so we piggy back on to the containment relation. ]
The verb to spawn implies the containment relation.

The verb to be ancestral to implies the enclosure relation.
The verb to be descended from implies the reversed enclosure relation.



Chapter - Windows for the styles table

[ These things *must* be defined first in order for sorting to work. ]

All-windows is a g-window.
All-buffer-windows is a g-window.
All-grid-windows is a g-window.



Chapter - The built-in windows

The main window is a text buffer g-window.

The status window is a text grid g-window spawned by the main window.
The position of the status window is g-placeabove.
The scale method of the status window is g-fixed-size.
The measurement of the status window is 1.

Use no status line translates as (- Constant USE_NO_STATUS_LINE 1; -).

The quote window is a g-window spawned by the main window.



Section - Styles for the built-in windows

[ These are the original styles set by Inform in VM_Initialise(). ]

Table of User Styles (continued)
window	style name	reversed	justification	font weight	italic
all-buffer-windows	italic-style	--	--	regular-weight	true

Section - Open the built-in windows

The open the built-in windows using Flexible Windows rule is listed instead of the open built-in windows rule in the for starting the virtual machine rulebook.
This is the open the built-in windows using Flexible Windows rule:
	if the main window is g-unpresent:
		open the main window;
	otherwise:
		clear the main window;
	if the no status line option is active:
		close the status window;
	otherwise:
		open the status window;
	close the quote window;

Part - The Flexible Windows API

Chapter - Opening and closing windows

To open up/-- (win - a g-window), as the acting main window:
	if win is g-unpresent and (win is the main window or the main window is ancestral to win):

Section - Calibrating windows - unindexed

A g-window can be currently being processed.

Definition: a g-window is paternal rather than childless if it spawns a g-present g-window.

Definition: a g-window is a next-step if it is the main window or it is spawned by something g-present.

To calibrate windows:
	[ Close windows that shouldn't be open and then open windows that shouldn't be closed ]
	while there is a not currently being processed g-unrequired g-present childless g-window (called win):
		[ Only run each window once, even if we end up back in this loop (by open/close being called in a before rule), to prevent infinite loops ]

	[ Tile windows automatically ]
	if the position of win is g-placenull:
		if the parent is vertically positioned:
			now the position of win is g-placeright;
		otherwise:

Section - Applying the generic styles

[ At this stage only apply the generic (non window specific) styles. ]

The set text styles rule is not listed in any rulebook.
A glulx zeroing-reference rule (this is the set generic text styles rule):
	let W be a number;
	repeat through the Table of User Styles:
		if the window entry is:
			-- All-windows:
				now W is 0;
			-- All-buffer-windows:
				now W is 3;
			-- All-grid-windows:
				now W is 4;
			-- otherwise:
				break;
		if there is a background color entry:
			set the background color of wintype W for the style name entry to the background color entry;
		if there is a color entry:
			set the color of wintype W for the style name entry to the color entry;
		if there is a first line indentation entry:
			set the first line indentation of wintype W for the style name entry to the first line indentation entry;
		if there is a fixed width entry:
			set fixed width of wintype W for the style name entry to the fixed width entry;
		if there is a font weight entry:
			set the font weight of wintype W for the style name entry to the font weight entry;
		if there is a indentation entry:
			set the indentation of wintype W for the style name entry to the indentation entry;
		if there is a italic entry:
			set italic of wintype W for the style name entry to the italic entry;
		if there is a justification entry:
			set the justification of wintype W for the style name entry to the justification entry;
		if there is a relative size entry:
			set the relative size of wintype W for the style name entry to the relative size entry;
		if there is a reversed entry:
			set reversed of wintype W for the style name entry to the reversed entry;

[ Gargoyle sets the cursor color to whatever the last text-buffer color hint was. We will reset it using a variable the story author can change.
This is apparently by design, but seems unuseful and buggy to me. I raised the issue at https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/garglk-dev/DdqG0Ppt2lY ]

The Gargoyle cursor color is initially "#000000".
After constructing a textual g-window (this is the Gargoyle cursor color rule):
	set the color of wintype 3 for normal-style to the Gargoyle cursor color;



Section - Applying window specific styles

[ Apply styles before constructing a window and then clear them afterwards. This is tricky because we must reinstate the generic styles. ]

Before constructing a textual g-window (called win) (this is the set the window specific styles rule):
	let W be a number;
	let found the window be a truth state;
	if the type of win is:
		-- g-text-buffer:
			now W is 3;
		-- g-text-grid:
			now W is 4;
		-- g-graphics:
			continue the activity;
	repeat through the Table of User Styles:
		unless the window entry is win:
			if found the window is true:
				continue the activity;
			next;
		now found the window is true;
		if there is a background color entry:
			set the background color of wintype W for the style name entry to the background color entry;
		if there is a color entry:
			set the color of wintype W for the style name entry to the color entry;
		if there is a first line indentation entry:
			set the first line indentation of wintype W for the style name entry to the first line indentation entry;
		if there is a fixed width entry:
			set fixed width of wintype W for the style name entry to the fixed width entry;
		if there is a font weight entry:
			set the font weight of wintype W for the style name entry to the font weight entry;
		if there is a indentation entry:
			set the indentation of wintype W for the style name entry to the indentation entry;
		if there is a italic entry:
			set italic of wintype W for the style name entry to the italic entry;
		if there is a justification entry:
			set the justification of wintype W for the style name entry to the justification entry;
		if there is a relative size entry:
			set the relative size of wintype W for the style name entry to the relative size entry;
		if there is a reversed entry:
			set reversed of wintype W for the style name entry to the reversed entry;

A first after constructing a textual g-window (called win) (this is the clear the window specific styles rule):
	let W be a number;
	let resetting required be a truth state;
	if the type of win is:
		-- g-text-buffer:
			now W is 3;
		-- g-text-grid:
			now W is 4;
		-- g-graphics:
			continue the activity;
	repeat through the Table of User Styles:
		unless the window entry is win:
			if resetting required is true:
				break;
			next;
		now resetting required is true;
		if there is a background color entry:
			clear the background color of wintype W for the style name entry;
		if there is a color entry:
			clear the color of wintype W for the style name entry;
		if there is a first line indentation entry:
			clear the first line indentation of wintype W for the style name entry;
		if there is a fixed width entry:
			clear fixed width of wintype W for the style name entry;
		if there is a font weight entry:
			clear the font weight of wintype W for the style name entry;
		if there is a indentation entry:

		if there is a relative size entry:
			clear the relative size of wintype W for the style name entry;
		if there is a reversed entry:
			clear reversed of wintype W for the style name entry;
	[ I'm not sure if this will be too much of a performance hit, but it's the simplest solution ]
	if resetting required is true:
		follow the set generic text styles rule;



Chapter - Window background colors

A g-window has a text called background color.

[ This needs to run before the set the window specific styles rule so that it won't overwrite any window specific backgrounds. ]
First before constructing a textual g-window (called win) (this is the set the background color of textual windows rule):
	if the background color of win is not empty:
		set the background color of wintype 0 for all-styles to the background color of win;

[ This needs to be run before the clear the window's styles rule so that it doesn't erase the styles reset by the set generic text styles rule ]
First after constructing a textual g-window (called win) (this is the reset the background color of textual windows rule):
	if the background color of win is not empty:
		clear the background color of wintype 0 for all-styles;

[ Setting the background color of graphics windows is handled by the automatic clearing which occurs after the window is constructed ]

[ As explained by Ben Cressey (http://groups.google.com/group/rec.arts.int-fiction/msg/b88316e2dcf1bb6b)
Gargoyle sets the colour of its window padding based on the last background colour style hint given to the normal style. So after clearing all the background colours and styles, we set it based on the background color of the main window, or just set white if it isn't set. ]

[ This phrase is made available in case you want to set the colour at some other time (such as when opening a pop-over window) ]
To set the Gargoyle window padding to (T - a text):
	set the background color of wintype 3 for normal-style to T;

To set the Gargoyle background color to the color (T - a text) (deprecated):
	set the background color of wintype 3 for normal-style to T;

After constructing a textual g-window (this is the Gargoyle window padding rule):
	let T be the background color of the acting main window;
	if T is empty:
		let T be "#FFFFFF";
	set the Gargoyle window padding to T;



Flexible Windows ends here.


---- DOCUMENTATION ----

Chapter: Introduction
	
Flexible Windows allows the Glulx author to construct and fill a series of multiple windows, which can be created and destroyed safely during the course of play. Restarts and restores are all handled properly. Windows can be graphical, text-buffers (like the main window is) or text-grids (in which case, glk calls can be used to place characters anywhere within them).

Although Flexible Windows does not supply any rules for using graphical windows beyond the most basic, several can be found in Emily Short's Simple Graphical Window extension. Version 15/160929 of Flexible Windows is compatible with version 10/160929 of Simple Graphical Window. Older versions of these two extensions are not compatible with each other.

Flexible Windows requires Alternative Startup Rules by Dannii Willis, Glulx Entry Points by Emily Short, and Glulx Text Effects by Emily Short.

Note that Flexible Windows uses the container relation for windows. We'll need to keep this in mind if we iterate through all containers.


Chapter: Window Types, Properties, and Styles

Section: Window Type

Each window is a thing of the kind g-window. There are three types of Glulx window: text buffer, text grid and graphics. A text buffer is a teletype-style stream of text (akin to the main window), a graphics screen cannot accept text but can render images, and a text grid (akin to the status bar) allows for flexible positioning of text characters (for instance, centering text). 

There are two potential ways to define a window's type. One is to declare it to be of the appropriate kind:

	The side window is a text buffer g-window.
	The side window is a text grid g-window.
	The side window is a graphics g-window.

The other way is to set the "type" property to one of g-text-buffer, g-text-grid, or g-graphics. This is useful when we can't use one of the kinds given above. The following statements are true (although they don't actually appear anywhere in the extension):

	The type of the main window is g-text-buffer.
	The type of the status window is g-text-grid.

	
Section: Window Position
	
All games start, by default, with a status bar along the top of the screen, and the main window below.

Glulx windows are formed from the main window by carving off segments using either horizontal or vertical strokes, with each stroke creating one new window, from which further windows can be cut. This automatically creates a tree-structure for windows, with each new window being sliced from one that came before. The extension refers to this process as "spawning", and you set up your layout of windows by telling the game which window spawns which. 

The position of each new window is specified using one of four positions: g-placeabove, g-placebelow, g-placeleft and g-placeright. Note that these indicate where the new window will be, rather than the direction of the slice taken.

So for example, to create a banner between the main screen and the status, we would write

	The banner window is a g-window. The main window spawns the banner window. The position of the banner window is g-placeabove.

For a more complicated layout, akin to a standard email client, with folder list, contacts, preview and files windows, we would write

	The contacts pane, folder list and preview window are g-windows. The main window spawns the preview window and the contacts pane. The contacts pane spawns the folder list.
	The position of the preview window is g-placebelow. The position of the contacts pane is g-placeleft. The position of the folder list is g-placeabove.

(Try sketching it out on a piece of paper.)


Section: Window Size

Once the rough positions of the windows have been decided, the next thing to allocate is their size. This can be done two ways: either by taking a proportional of the window being spawned from (so a 40% slice or a 15% slice), or taking a window of fixed size (in pixels for graphics windows, and in columns/rows for text windows). The proportion to take, or the width of a fixed size side window (equivalently, the height of a top or bottom window) is set using the "measurement" property of the g-window. So we could write

	The scale method of the side window is g-proportional. The measurement of the side window is 25.
	The scale method of the banner window is g-fixed-size. The measurement of the banner window is 30.

Finally, if we are using proportional windows, we can optionally set a "minimum size" or a "maximum size", which will be used if the proportional size would be outsize those limits.


Section: Text Style and Background Color

Flexible Windows adds a "window" column to the Table of User Styles found in the Glulx Text Effects extension. We can specify styles for individual windows by continuing the table. The "window" column is for the name of the window; the rest of the columns are described in the Glulx Text Effects documentation.

	Table of User Styles (continued)
	window (a g-window)	style name (a glulx text style)	background color (a text)	color (a text)	first line indentation (a number)	fixed width (a truth state)	font weight (a font weight)	indentation (a number)	italic (a truth state)	justification (a text justification)	relative size (a number)	reversed (a truth state)

Note that the "background color" column is for the background color of the text only, not the background color of the entire window.

To color the background of the entire window, we instead set the g-window property "background color" to a six-digit web color code (with or without the # symbol):

	The background color of the side window is "#CCCCFF".

If the story will be running in a browser, we'll need to use CSS to set custom colors or styles. See the "Rock Value" section for how to refer to a particular window in CSS.


Section: Rock Value

Internally, Glulx windows are dynamic objects, created as they are opened. Our g-windows, on the other hand, are static objects. When Flexible Windows opens a window, it gives the window a number, called the "rock." This rock value serves to identify the dynamic Glk/Glulx window object as the current instantiation of the static g-window object that shares the same rock.

Normally, Flexible Windows will set the rock values for all g-windows automatically, and the whole process occurs behind the scenes. There may be times, however, when we want to set a g-window's rock to a particular value. For example, Quixe, the javascript Glulx interpreter, uses rock values to identify windows for styling with CSS. In that system, the CSS for a window with rock value 1010 might look like this:

	.WindowRock_1010 { background-color: blue; }

Rocks should be numbered 200 and above. This extension starts numbering them from 1000. It is customary, though not necessary, to skip 10 when adding a new window; that is, for three windows, we'd have 1000, 1010, and 1020. In fact, this is how Flexible Windows will assign them if we don't intervene. To ensure that a g-window gets a particular rock value, we can set it like so:

	The rock number of the side window is 245.

If we set numbers ending in 5 for our manual rocks, we will never conflict with the automated numbering.


Chapter: Using Windows
	
Section: Overview

This extension provides little in the way of support for graphics windows or text grid windows, both of which can display images and draw shapes in a full range of colours. Text grids can also locate the cursor (so, say, could be used to make a pac-man game). A few useful phrases for text-buffer windows are supplied.


Section: Opening a Window

To open a window (for instance, our example window named "side window"):

	open side window

The only point to note is that the "open" command will, if necessary, also open any sub-windows required to reach the window you've asked for. So if the side window is a spawn of the banner window, and the banner window is currently not open, the "open side window" command will open both.


Section: Closing a Window

To close the window:
	
	close side window

The point above applies here, in reverse: shutting a window will also shut all sub-windows contained by it.


Section: Refreshing a Window

The refreshing activity is for redrawing windows. We can invoke the refreshing activity like this:

	refresh side window

To refresh all the windows:

	refresh all windows
	
The refreshing activity will automatically first check if the window is present, focus the window, and clear the window, so we usually won't need to do those things manually.

Rules for the refreshing activity should (ideally) be able to reconstruct entirely the contents of the window (otherwise, after an UNDO or a RESTORE, information will be lost):

	Rule for refreshing the side window (this is the display inventory in side window rule):
		try taking inventory;

		
Section: Checking if a Window is Present		
		
To check the existence of a window at any time, we can test for the g-present property:

	if side window is g-present
	if side window is g-unpresent
	
When we refresh a window, this will be done automatically.


Section: Focusing a Window

To manually move the focus to a particular window:

	focus side window
	
This is usually not necessary, as focusing is done automatically when we refresh a window.


Section: Clearing a Window

To manually clear a window:

	clear side window
	
This is usually not necessary, as clearing is done automatically when we refresh a window.
	
	
Section: Checking Which Window is in Focus

To find out which window is currently in focus, we can check the variable "current focus window":

	Rule for printing the name of the old book while taking inventory and the current focus window is side window:
		say "The Meteor, the Stone (etc.)" instead.
		
		
Section: Turning Off the Status Line

By default, Glulx games will incorporate a status line. To turn this off quickly, a use option is provided:

	Use no status line.


Example: * Inventory Window - A simple example showing how to place a side window displaying the player's inventory.

	*: "Inventory Window"

	Include Flexible Windows by Jon Ingold.

	The side window is a text buffer g-window spawned by the main window.
	The position of the side window is g-placeright.
	The measurement of the side window is 30.

	Rule for refreshing the side window:
		try taking inventory.
	
	When play begins:
		open the side window.
	
	Every turn:
		refresh the side window.
	
	The Study is a room. In the study is an old oak desk. On the desk is a Parker pen, a letter, an envelope and twenty dollars.

	Test me with "take pen/take letter/i/take all".
