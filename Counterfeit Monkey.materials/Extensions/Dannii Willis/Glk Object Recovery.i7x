Section - Glk object recovery

[ These should technically all be called 'glk' rulebooks, but we'll keep them named 'glulx' for compatibility. ]
The glulx zeroing-reference rules is a rulebook.
The glulx resetting-windows rules is a rulebook.
The glulx resetting-streams rules is a rulebook.
The glulx resetting-filerefs rules is a rulebook.
The glulx resetting-channels rules is a rulebook.
The glulx object-updating rules is a rulebook.

Current glulx rock is a number that varies.
Current glulx rock-ref is a number that varies.



Section - GGRecoverObjects

[ Rather than intercepting IdentifyGlkObject() as GEP does, replace GGRecoverObjects(). This allows us to move the built in I6 variable management to rules which can be replaced by other extensions if needed. ]
Include (-
Replace GGRecoverObjects;
-) before "Glulx.i6t".

Glk Object Recovery ends here.

---- Documentation ----

This extension is a low level utility library for managing Glk references. When a Glulx game restarts and restores, the current Glk IO state is not reset. All the old windows, sound channels etc. will be kept as they were, even though the game file might be expecting a different state. This extension allows Inform 7 game files to ensure that the IO state is as it should be. It does this in three stages:

1. The "glulx zeroing-reference rulebook" is run. Rules should be added to reset all Glk references as if none existed.

2. The "glulx resetting-windows rulebook" etc. are run. These rulebooks will be run once for each Glk IO object which does currently exist.

3. The "glulx object-updating rulebook" is run. Rules should be added to correct the Glk IO state by, for example, closing windows which shouldn't exist, and opening windows which should but currently do not.

See the extension Flexible Windows by Jon Ingold for a practical demonstration of how these rulebooks are used.
